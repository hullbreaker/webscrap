Extremity Bias in Online Reviews: The Role of Attrition,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211073579,16-May-22,01-Aug,2022,59,4,675,695,"In a range of studies across platforms, researchers have shown that online ratings are characterized by distributions with disproportionately heavy tails. The authors of this study focus on understanding the underlying process that yields such “J-shaped” or “extreme” distributions. They propose a novel theoretical mechanism behind the emergence of J-shaped distributions: differential attrition, or the idea that potential reviewers with moderate experiences are more likely to leave the pool of active reviewers than potential reviewers with extreme experiences. The authors present an analytical model that integrates this mechanism with two extant mechanisms: differential utility and base rates. They show that although all three mechanisms can give rise to extreme distributions, only the utility-based and attrition-based mechanisms can explain the authors’ empirical observation from a large-scale field experiment that an unincentivized solicitation email from an online travel platform reduces review extremity. Subsequent analyses provide clear empirical evidence for the existence of both differential attrition and differential utility.","Leif Brandes, David Godes, Dina Mayzlin","microeconomics, field experiments, electronic commerce, online reviews, online word of mouth",9,,,,
Thumbs Up or Down: Consumer Reactions to Decisions by Algorithms Versus Humans,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211070016,10-Mar-22,01-Aug,2022,59,4,696,717,"Although companies increasingly are adopting algorithms for consumer-facing tasks (e.g., application evaluations), little research has compared consumers’ reactions to favorable decisions (e.g., acceptances) versus unfavorable decisions (e.g., rejections) about themselves that are made by an algorithm versus a human. Ten studies reveal that, in contrast to managers’ predictions, consumers react less positively when a favorable decision is made by an algorithmic (vs. a human) decision maker, whereas this difference is mitigated for an unfavorable decision. The effect is driven by distinct attribution processes: it is easier for consumers to internalize a favorable decision outcome that is rendered by a human than by an algorithm, but it is easy to externalize an unfavorable decision outcome regardless of the decision maker type. The authors conclude by advising managers on how to limit the likelihood of less positive reactions toward algorithmic (vs. human) acceptances.","Gizem Yalcin, Sarah Lim, Stefano Puntoni,...","algorithms, decision making, decision outcome favorability, attribution theory",19,,,,
Variety Effects in Mobile Advertising,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211056090,12-Apr-22,01-Aug,2022,59,4,718,738,"Mobile app users are often exposed to a sequence of short-lived marketing interventions (e.g., ads) within each usage session. This study examines how an increase in the variety of ads shown in a session affects a user's response to the next ad. The authors leverage the quasi-experimental variation in ad assignment in their data and propose an empirical framework that accounts for different types of confounding to isolate the effects of a unit increase in variety. Across a series of models, the authors consistently show that an increase in ad variety in a session results in a higher response rate to the next ad: holding all else fixed, a unit increase in variety of the prior sequence of ads can increase the click-through rate on the next ad by approximately 13%. The authors then explore the underlying mechanism and document empirical evidence for an attention-based account. The article offers important managerial implications by identifying a source of interdependence across ad exposures that is often ignored in the design of advertising auctions. Furthermore, the attention-based mechanism suggests that platforms can incorporate real-time attention measures to help advertisers with targeting dynamics.","Omid Rafieian, Hema Yoganarasimhan","mobile advertising, variety, diversity, attention, digitization, sequential decision making",5,,,,
The Bulletproof Glass Effect: Unintended Consequences of Privacy Notices,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211069093,18-Feb-22,01-Aug,2022,59,4,739,754,"Drawing from a content analysis of publicly traded companies’ privacy notices, a survey of managers, a field study, and five online experiments, this research investigates how consumers respond to privacy notices. A privacy notice, by placing legally enforceable limits on a firm's data practices, communicating safeguards, and signaling transparency, might be expected to promote confidence that personal data will not be misused. Indeed, most managers expected a privacy notice to make customers feel more secure (Study 1). Yet, consistent with the analogy that bulletproof glass can increase feelings of vulnerability despite the protection offered, formal privacy notices undermined consumer trust and decreased purchase interest even when they emphasized objective protection (Studies 2, 3, and 5) or omitted any mention of potentially concerning data practices (Study 6). These unintended consequences did not occur, however, when consumers had an a priori reason to be distrustful (Study 4) or when benevolence cues were added to privacy notices (Studies 5 and 6). Finally, Study 7 showed that both the presence and conspicuous absence of privacy information are sufficient to trigger decreased purchase intent. Together, these results provide actionable guidance to managers on how to effectively convey privacy information (without hurting purchase interest).","Aaron R. Brough, David A. Norton, Shannon L.

Bayesian Consumer Profiling: How to Estimate Consumer Characteristics from Aggregate Data,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211059088,18-Apr-22,01-Aug,2022,59,4,755,774,"Firms use aggregate data from data brokers (e.g., Acxiom, Experian) and external data sources (e.g., Census) to infer the likely characteristics of consumers in a target list and thus better predict consumers’ profiles and needs unobtrusively. The authors demonstrate that the simple count method most commonly used in this effort relies implicitly on an assumption of conditional independence that fails to hold in many settings of managerial interest. They develop a Bayesian profiling introducing different conditional independence assumptions. They also show how to introduce additional observed covariates into this model. They use simulations to demonstrate that in managerially relevant settings, the Bayesian method will outperform the simple count method, often by an order of magnitude. The authors then compare different conditional independence assumptions in two case studies. The first example estimates customers’ age on the basis of their first names; prediction errors decrease substantially. In the second example, the authors infer the income, occupation, and education of online visitors of a marketing analytic software company based exclusively on their IP addresses. The face validity of the predictions improves dramatically and reveals an interesting (and more complex) endogenous list-selection mechanism than the one suggested by the simple count method.","Arnaud De Bruyn, Thomas Otter","consumer profiling, data augmentation, data brokerage, Bayesian profiling, sociodemographic profiling, geolocation",1,,,,
Default Effects of Credit Card Minimum Payments,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211070589,28-Feb-22,01-Aug,2022,59,4,775,796,"Credit card minimum payments are designed to ensure that individuals pay down their debt over time, and scheduling minimum automatic repayments helps people avoid forgetting to repay. Yet minimum payments have additional, unintended psychological default effects by drawing attention away from the card balance due. First, once individuals set the minimum automatic repayment as the default, they then neglect to make the occasional larger repayments they made previously. As a result, individuals incur considerably more credit card interest than late payment fees avoided. Using detailed transaction data, the authors show that approximately 8% of all of the interest ever paid is due to this effect. Second, manual credit card payments are lower when individuals are prompted with minimum payment information. In an experiment, the authors test two new interventions to mitigate this effect—a prompt for full repayment and a prompt asking those repaying little to pay more—yielding large counter effects. Thus, shrouding the minimum payment option for automatic and manual payments and directing attention to the full balance may remedy the unintended effects of default minimum payments.","Hiroaki Sakaguchi, Neil Stewart, John Gathergood,...","default, inattention, automatic repayment, credit card, consumer debt",17,,,,
Spotlight Personnel: How Hiring and Turnover Drive Service Performance Versus Demand,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211068049,07-Mar-22,01-Aug,2022,59,4,797,820,"In many sectors of the entertainment industry, a few employees attract the public spotlight when performing the core service. For example, in professional team sports, a team of players competes in games, and in TV shows, a cast of artists acts in different episodes. These employees, coined “spotlight personnel,” are an essential but expensive element of ongoing service delivery. Despite their importance and cost, very little is known about how changes in spotlight personnel affect service performance and demand. To address this gap, this article uses unique data on professional German soccer teams, tracking the quantity (number of players) and quality (average transfer price) of spotlight personnel hiring (incoming transfers) and turnover (outgoing transfers), objective service performance (winning percentage), and demand (ticket sales) across four decades, using both traditional and novel time series methods. The results show that service performance and demand are primarily affected by spotlight personnel hiring rather than by turnover. Hiring quantity decreases service performance yet increases demand, whereas hiring quality benefits both service performance and demand. The analysis further uncovers that these effects are subject to dynamic interactions and nonlinearities. Investment scenarios showcase how understanding these effects can substantially improve managerial decision making.","Christine Eckert, Harald J. van Heerde, Hauke A.

Time Periods Feel Longer When They Span More Category Boundaries: Evidence from the Lab and the Field,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211073810,24-Mar-22,01-Aug,2022,59,4,821,839,"Seven experiments (total N = 3,509) and a large field data set (N = 1,820,671) demonstrate that time periods of equal duration are not always perceived as equivalent. The authors find that periods feel longer when they span more time categories (e.g., hour, month). For example, periods like 1:45 p.m.–3:15 p.m. and March 31–April 6 (boundary-expanded) feel longer than, say, 1:15 p.m.–2:45 p.m. and April 2–April 8 (boundary-compressed). Reflecting this, participants anticipated completing more work during boundary-expanded periods than during equivalent boundary-compressed periods. This effect appears to result from the salience and placement of time boundaries. Consequently, participants preferred scheduling pleasant activities for boundary-expanded periods and unpleasant activities for boundary-compressed periods. Moreover, participants were willing to pay more to avoid—and required more money to endure—a long wait when that wait was presented as boundary-expanded. Finally, data from more than 1.8 million rideshare trips suggest that consumers are more likely to choose independent rides (e.g., UberX) when they are boundary-compressed when the alternative shared option (e.g., UberPool) is boundary-expanded. Together, our studies reveal that time periods feel longer when they span more boundaries and that this phenomenon shapes consumers’ scheduling and purchasing decisions.","Kristin Donnelly, Giovanni Compiani, Ellen R.K.

High-Energy Ad Content: A Large-Scale Investigation of TV Commercials,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211067802,17-Feb-22,01-Aug,2022,59,4,840,859,"A trend reported by both academics and practitioners is that advertising on TV has become increasingly energetic. This study investigates the association between the energy level in ad content and consumers’ ad-tuning tendency. Using a data set of over 27,000 TV commercials delivered to U.S. homes between 2015 and 2018, the authors first present a framework to algorithmically measure the energy level in ad content from the video of ads. This algorithm-based measure is then compared with human-perceived energy levels showing that the measure is related to the level of arousal stimulated by ad content. By relating the energy levels in ad content with the ad-tuning tendency using two empirical procedures, the authors document the following: overall, more energetic commercials are more likely to be tuned in or less likely to be avoided by viewers. The positive association between energy levels in ad content and ad tuning is statistically significant after controlling for placement and other aspects of commercials. However, the association varies across product categories and program genres. The main implication of this study is that advertisers should pay attention to components of ad content other than loudness, which has been regulated by law.","Joonhyuk Yang, Yingkang Xie, Lakshman Krishnamurthi,...","advertising, ad tuning, ad avoidance, multimedia data, audio information retrieval",72,,,,
Handling Endogenous Regressors Using Copulas: A Generalization to Linear Panel Models with Fixed Effects and Correlated Regressors,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211070820,07-Apr-22,01-Aug,2022,59,4,860,881,"This article proposes a panel data generalization for a recently suggested instrumental variable‐free estimation method that builds on joint estimation. The author shows how the method can be extended to linear panel models by combining fixed-effects transformations with the common generalized least squares transformation to allow for heterogeneous intercepts. To account for between-regressor dependence, the author proposes determining the joint distribution of the error term and all explanatory variables using a Gaussian copula function, with the distinction that some variables are endogenous and the others are exogenous. The identification does not require any instrumental variables if the regressor–error relation is nonlinear. With a normally distributed error, nonnormally distributed endogenous regressors are therefore required. Monte Carlo simulations assess the finite sample performance of the proposed estimator and demonstrate its superiority to conventional instrumental variable estimation. A specific advantage of the proposed method is that the estimator is unbiased in dynamic panel models with small time dimensions and serially correlated errors; therefore, it is a useful alternative to generalized-method-of-moments-style instrumentation. The practical applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated via an empirical example.",Rouven E.

Down a Rabbit Hole: How Prior Media Consumption Shapes Subsequent Media Consumption,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211055403,24-Jan-22,01-Jun,2022,59,3,453,471,"Consumers often become “stuck in a rabbit hole” when consuming media. They may watch several YouTube videos in the same category or view several thematically similar artistic images on Instagram in a row, finding it difficult to stop. What causes individuals to choose to consume additional media on a topic that is similar to (vs. different from) what they just experienced? The authors examine a novel antecedent: the consecutive consumption of multiple similar media. After viewing multiple similar media consecutively, more consumers choose to (1) view additional similar media over dissimilar media or (2) complete a dissimilar activity entirely, even when the prior consumption pattern is externally induced. The rabbit hole effect occurs because of increased accessibility of the shared category: when a category is more accessible, people feel immersed in it and anticipate that future options within that category will be more enjoyable. The authors identify three characteristics of media consumption that contribute to the rabbit hole effect by increasing category accessibility: similarity, repetition, and consecutiveness of prior media consumption. This research contributes to literature on technology, choice, and variety seeking, and it offers implications for increasing (vs. slowing) similar consumption.","Kaitlin Woolley*, Marissa A.

Modernizing Retailers in an Emerging Market: Investigating Externally Focused and Internally Focused Approaches,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211058437,18-Feb-22,01-Jun,2022,59,3,472,496,"This article studies the impact of business modernization on the sales performance of traditional retailers in an emerging market. The authors define modernization as the adoption of physical structures and tangible practices of organized retail chains (e.g., exterior signage with store name and logo, a database to record product-level information). To address this research question, they implement a randomized field experiment in Mexico City with 1,148 retailers. The sample is randomized as follows: 385 firms are externally modernized in ways that are visible to customers, 383 firms are internally modernized in ways that are not visible to customers, and 380 firms form a control group. The authors find a significant and persistent main effect of modernization on sales. Firms in both treatment groups increase monthly sales by 15%–19% 24 months after study recruitment. In terms of novel mechanism evidence, externally modernized firms improve their store-level branding, while internally modernized firms strengthen their product management. This article also provides an exploratory analysis to guide policy makers, managerial stakeholders, and retailers on how to modernize for the highest returns. This analysis suggests that it is most useful to modernize a firm’s exterior appearance, customer engagement methods, demand analysis, and stock-ordering processes. Finally, the largest improvements come from the initial few modernizing changes, after which returns are diminishing.","Stephen J.

Frequency Versus Intensity: How Thinking of a Frequent Consumption Indulgence as Social Versus Solitary Affects Preferences for How to Cut Back,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211055741,10-Jan-22,01-Jun,2022,59,3,497,516,"Many consumers engage in frequent consumption indulgences. Because such indulgences accumulate resource costs (e.g., money, calories), consumers are often prompted to cut back, posing questions for how to design cutback programs with consumer appeal. This research distinguishes between frequent indulgences that consumers think of as social (vs. solitary), demonstrating that thinking of an indulgence as social (vs. solitary) decreases preferences to cut “frequency” (how often the indulgence occasion occurs) and increases preferences to cut “intensity” (choosing a within-category substitute that involves lower resource expenditure). The author explains these effects by differentiating between enjoyment from the product itself and enjoyment from aspects outside the product. Thinking of an indulgence as social (vs. solitary) heightens people’s anticipated enjoyment, particularly for aspects outside of the product, decreasing interest in cutting the number of occasions (cutting frequency) and increasing interest in cutting back on the product itself via a within-category substitute (cutting intensity). This divergence in cutback preferences for social (vs. solitary) experiences is thus eliminated (1) when consumers think of social experiences with distant (vs. close) others, which involve lower enjoyment outside of the product, or (2) when solitary experiences primarily involve heightened enjoyment for aspects outside of the product.",Peggy J.

Prominent Retailer and Intrabrand Competition,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211044105,15-Nov-21,01-Jun,2022,59,3,517,533,"Online retail search traffic is often concentrated at a “prominent” retailer for a product. The authors unpack the ramifications of this pattern on pricing, profit, and consumer welfare in an intrabrand setting. Prominence denotes a larger number of heterogenous-search-cost consumers starting their search at the prominent retailer than at any other retailer. These analyses show that search traffic concentration can intensify intrabrand competition, lower average prices of all retailers, and improve consumer welfare. Interestingly, the prominent retailer's incremental traffic advantage can increase or reduce its own profit; the authors denote these as the “blessing” and “curse” of prominence, respectively. The authors extend their analysis to a setting where consumers consider searching only among those retailers they are individually aware of; the prominent retailer is included in all these individual awareness sets. The effects on market average prices and welfare carry over, but only below a critical threshold level of the prominent retailer's first-search traffic advantage. Above this threshold, market average prices rise and welfare decreases, making this the region where search concentration warrants scrutiny from policy makers. The authors close with policy remedies and managerial implications of search concentration.","Ruitong Wang, Yi Zhu, George John","competitive strategy, curse of prominence, digital markets, intrabrand competition, ordered search, search cost heterogeneity, search traffic concentration",2,,,,

The author exploits a Federal Trade Commission–enabled shutdown of fake news advertisements for various products such as acai cleanses and teeth whiteners (but where the product sites continued to remain operational) to identify the extent of consumer interest in the presence and absence of fake news advertising. The findings indicate that interest wanes after the shutdown of fake news advertising, with the probability of a product site not receiving any new visits increasing by 22%.

How Does Global–Local Identity Affect Consumer Preference for Access-Based Consumption? Investigating the Mediating Role of Consumption Openness,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211055130,10-Jan-22,01-Jun,2022,59,3,555,577,"Given the increasing importance of the global sharing economy, consumers face the decision of whether to choose an access-based option versus an owned option. However, understanding of how consumers’ global–local identity may influence their preference for access-based consumption is rather limited. The authors fill this knowledge gap by proposing that consumers high in global identity (“globals”) have a greater preference for access-based consumption than those high in local identity (“locals”). Such effects are mediated by consumers’ consumption openness. Consistent with the “consumption openness” account, the authors find that when the desire for openness is enhanced by a contextual cue, locals’ preference for access-based consumption is elevated, whereas globals’ preference for access-based consumption is unaffected. However, when the desire for openness is suppressed by a contextual cue, globals’ preference for access-based consumption is reduced, whereas locals’ preference for access-based consumption is unaffected. Similarly, consumers’ traveler–settler orientation sets a boundary for the relationship between global–local identity and preference for access-based consumption, given its close association with consumption openness. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.","Xiaodong Nie, Zhiyong Yang, Yinlong Zhang,...","sharing economy, preference for access-based consumption, global–local identity, consumption openness, traveler–settler orientation",,,,,
Perceived Versus Negotiated Discounts: The Role of Advertised Reference Prices in Price Negotiations,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211034443,14-Oct-21,01-Jun,2022,59,3,578,599,"Retailers routinely present a posted or sale price together with a higher advertised reference price, in an effort to evoke a perception of the discount the consumer is receiving. However, if prices can be negotiated, what impact does this initial perceived discount (IPD) have on the ultimate discount, demand, and revenue? With data from consumers of a large durable goods retailer, in a natural decision-making environment, this study provides evidence that a greater IPD is associated with smaller negotiated discounts. Then, a lab experiment involving negotiation and purchase decisions for multiple products, with randomly assigned values of the IPD, establishes that a $1 increase in IPD lowers the negotiated discount by 5.7 cents. Furthermore, 55% of this decrease can be attributed to reduction in the participants’ likelihood to initiate a negotiation. Under bargaining, almost one-third of the increase in revenue from a higher IPD stems from an increase in the negotiated price, which is unlike fixed pricing, in which setting an increase in IPD affects revenue only through changes in demand. Finally, the optimal advertised reference prices a seller would post under bargaining and fixed pricing are similar, but the benefit from posting this price is significantly higher under bargaining. These findings in turn have implications for researchers, retailers, consumers and policy makers.",Pranav Jindal,"price negotiations, bargaining, advertised reference prices, initial perceived discount, anchoring, behavioral economics, comparative price advertising",1,,,,
Attribute Sentiment Scoring with Online Text Reviews: Accounting for Language Structure and Missing Attributes,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211052500,04-Jan-22,01-Jun,2022,59,3,600,622,"The authors address two significant challenges in using online text reviews to obtain fine-grained, attribute-level sentiment ratings. First, in contrast to methods that rely on word frequency, they develop a deep learning convolutional–long short-term memory hybrid model to account for language structure. The convolutional layer accounts for spatial structure (adjacent word groups or phrases), and long short-term memory accounts for the sequential structure of language (sentiment distributed and modified across nonadjacent phrases). Second, they address the problem of missing attributes in text when constructing attribute sentiment scores, as reviewers write about only a subset of attributes and remain silent on others. They develop a model-based imputation strategy using a structural model of heterogeneous rating behavior. Using Yelp restaurant review data, they show superior attribute sentiment scoring accuracy with their model. They identify three reviewer segments with different motivations: status seeking, altruism/want voice, and need to vent/praise. Surprisingly, attribute mentions in reviews are driven by the need to inform and vent/praise rather than by attribute importance. The heterogeneous model-based imputation performs better than other common imputations and, importantly, leads to managerially significant corrections in restaurant attribute ratings. More broadly, the results suggest that social science research should pay more attention to reducing measurement error in variables constructed from text.","Ishita Chakraborty, Minkyung Kim, K.

The Impact of Historical Price Information on Purchase Deferral,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211060359,24-Jan-22,01-Jun,2022,59,3,623,640,"In this article, the authors examine how historical price information influences consumers’ decision to defer a purchase. They focus on two aspects of historical price information: the direction and the frequency of past price changes. The authors advance a theoretical framework postulating that the interaction between these two factors shapes consumers’ decisions to buy now versus later. Controlling for the total magnitude of price changes, the authors propose that consumers are more likely to defer purchase when the price of the product has previously increased compared with when the price has decreased. Importantly, the authors hypothesize that this effect is more pronounced when consumers observe a single large change in price (e.g., a decrease of $100 vs. an increase of $100) compared with when they observe multiple smaller changes that establish a trend (e.g., four decreases of $25 vs. four increases of $25). The authors argue that these effects are driven by differences in consumers’ expectations about future prices. They test their predictions, as well as two moderators of the proposed effects—the monotonicity and the timing of price changes—in six well-powered preregistered experimental studies (N = 5,713) using both hypothetical and actual purchases.","Manissa P.

A Reference-Dependent-Preferences-Based Model of Extended Warranty Purchase Decisions,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211056911,25-Mar-22,01-Jun,2022,59,3,641,658,"Durable goods often come bundled with limited-time and sometimes generous factory/base warranties. Yet, for many durable goods, customers purchase extended warranties against which they rarely make claims. This study offers a reference-dependent-preferences-based theoretical explanation for why consumers purchase extended warranties even if their purchased good is already covered by a base warranty. The authors show that consumers treat base warranties as a reference point, thereby creating a qualitative difference in the valuation of an extended warranty on the purchased product. The proposed theory model is validated using observational data from the automobile industry and shows how the reference-dependent-preferences-based effect varies with vehicle quality and macroeconomic conditions. The analyses reveal auto buyers’ elevated loss-aversion motivations and higher price sensitivity during weaker macroeconomic conditions than during more robust macroeconomic conditions. Finally, the authors use the empirical model to identify opportunities for auto dealers to engage in targeted price promotions as a function of prevailing macroeconomic conditions. These findings have important implications for marketing managers, as they provide valuable guidance on when an extended warranty should be promoted, to whom it should be promoted, and which extended warranty should be marketed.","Hyeong-Tak Lee, Sriram Venkataraman","warranty, reference-dependent preferences, loss aversion, automobile industry",1,,,,

Cross-National Differences in Market Response: Line-Length, Price, and Distribution Elasticities in 14 Indo-Pacific Rim Economies,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211058102,21-Feb-22,01-Apr,2022,59,2,251,270,"The field's knowledge of marketing-mix elasticities is largely restricted to developed countries in the North-Atlantic region, even though other parts of the world—especially the Indo-Pacific Rim region—have become economic powerhouses.

We Succeeded Together, Now What: Relationship Power and Sequential Decisions in Couples’ Joint Goal Pursuits,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211034513,06-Oct-21,01-Apr,2022,59,2,271,289,"Research has demonstrated that after making high goal progress, consumers feel liberated to engage in goal-inconsistent behaviors. But what happens after consumers make high progress in the context of joint goal pursuit? The authors examine how jointly made progress toward a joint goal pursued by couples affects subsequent individually made goal-relevant decisions. Across five experiments with both lab-created couples and married participants and financial data from a couples’ money management mobile app, the authors show that after making high progress on a joint goal (vs. low or no progress), partners with higher relationship power are more likely to disengage from the joint goal to pursue personal concerns (e.g., indulge themselves, pursue individual goals), whereas partners with lower relationship power do not disengage from the joint goal and continue engaging in goal-consistent actions that maintain its pursuit. The authors elucidate the underlying mechanism, providing evidence that the joint goal progress boosts the relational self-concept of high- (but not low-) relationship-power partners, and this drives the effects. Importantly, they demonstrate the effectiveness of two theory-grounded and easily implementable interventions that promote goal-consistent behaviors among high-relationship-power consumers in the context of joint savings goals.","Hristina Nikolova, Gergana Y.

Information Disclosure Policy and Its Implications: Ratcheting in Supply Chains,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211035115,06-Dec-21,01-Apr,2022,59,2,290,305,"Fear of escalating input prices in response to retail success is a commonly discussed phenomenon affecting supply chains. Such a ratchet effect arises when a retailer feels compelled to modify its investments to better serve the end customers in order to hide positive prospects and restrain future wholesale price hikes. In a two-period model of supply chain interactions, the authors demonstrate that such an endogenous ratchet effect can have multifaceted reverberations. A retailer fearing price hikes may be tempted to curtail near-term profits to ensure favorable long-term pricing. In response, the supplier can use deep discounts in its initial wholesale prices to convince the retailer to focus on its short-term profits rather than long-term pricing concerns. These deep discounts not only encourage mutually beneficial investments but also alleviate double marginalization inefficiencies along the supply chain. In light of these results, the authors show that a mandatory information disclosure policy to reduce the ratchet effect decreases total channel efficiency compared with no information disclosure, precisely because mandatory disclosure interrupts the healthy tension among supply chain partners. Thus, the model presents a scenario in which ratcheting concerns can create a degree of self-enforcing cooperation that results in socially beneficial responses in supply chains.","Brian Mittendorf, Jiwoong Shin, Dae-Hee Yoon","ratcheting, information disclosure, supply chains, pricing",1,,,,
Observing Product Touch: The Vicarious Haptic Effect in Digital Marketing and Virtual Reality,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211059540,15-Feb-22,01-Apr,2022,59,2,306,326,"Retail is rapidly evolving to construct virtual environments for consumers. Online product images, videos, and virtual reality (VR) interfaces enliven consumer experiences and are a source of product information. Because consumers are unable to physically touch products in these digital environments, this research examines vicarious touch, or the observation of a hand in physical contact with a product in a digital environment. Across eight studies, the authors use images, GIFs, and VR to show that vicarious touch affects consumers’ psychological ownership and product valuation due to the active nature of product touch, which results in a felt sense of body ownership of the virtual hand. This is termed the “vicarious haptic effect.” Results demonstrate that it is not enough to show a hand in an advertisement; the hand must be touching a product. The vicarious haptic effect is strongest for people who become highly stimulated by an immersive VR experience (i.e., measured via the elevation in heart rate). The vicarious haptic effect is attenuated if the viewed interaction does not represent a diagnostic hand movement. The authors discuss theoretical and managerial implications for digital product presentation to encourage feelings of product ownership and valuation.","Andrea Webb Luangrath, Joann Peck, William Hedgcock,...","online retail, touch, haptics, vicarious experience, psychological ownership, body ownership, virtual reality, heart rate",219,,,,

Dr. Oz, a celebrity physician, often makes medical recommendations with limited or marginal scientific evidence. Although reputable news agencies have traditionally acted as gatekeepers of reliable information, they face the intense pressure of “the eyeball game.” Customer reviews, despite their authenticity, may come from deceived consumers. Therefore, it remains unclear whether public information sources can correct the misleading health information. In the context of over-the-counter weight loss products, the authors carefully analyze the cascading of information post endorsement. The analysis of extensive textual content with deep-learning methods reveals that legitimate news outlets respond to Dr. Oz's endorsement by generating more news articles about the ingredient; on average, articles after the endorsement contain higher sentiment, so news agencies seem to amplify rather than rectify the misleading endorsement. The finding highlights a serious concern: the risk of hype news diffusion. Research articles react too slowly to mitigate the problem, and online customer reviews and product discussions provide only marginal corrections. The findings underscore the importance of oversight to mitigate the risk of cascading hype news.","Zijun (June) Shi, Xiao Liu, Kannan Srinivasan","hype news, Oz Effect, health care, misinformation, natural language processing",43,,,,
Preference Reversals Between Digital and Physical Goods,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211065020,21-Mar-22,01-Apr,2022,59,2,353,373,"The proliferation of digital goods has led to an increased interest in how the digitization of products and services affects consumer behavior. In this article, the authors show that although consumers are willing to pay more for physical than digital goods, this difference attenuates—and even reverses—when consumers are asked to make a choice between the two product formats. This effect is explained by a contingent weighting principle: In willingness to pay, a quantitative task, consumers anchor on quantitative information (e.g., market beliefs). However, in choice, a qualitative task, consumers anchor on qualitative information (e.g., which good dominates on the most important attribute). These differences in contingent weighting result in physical goods being preferred in willingness to pay, but their digital equivalent being preferred relatively more in choice. The authors draw conclusions from ten preregistered experiments and six supplemental studies using a variety of goods in hypothetical and incentive-compatible contexts, as well as within- and between-subjects designs. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for the marketing of digital goods.","Rhia Catapano, Fuad Shennib, Jonathan Levav","digital goods, preference reversals, compatibility, digitization, preference elicitation",3,,,,
Demand Interactions in Sharing Economies: Evidence from a Natural Experiment Involving Airbnb and Uber/Lyft,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211062172,18-Feb-22,01-Apr,2022,59,2,374,391,"The authors examine whether and how ride-sharing services influence the demand for home-sharing services. Their identification strategy hinges on a natural experiment in which Uber/Lyft exited Austin, Texas, in May 2016 due to local regulation. Using a 12-month longitudinal data set of 11,536 Airbnb properties, they find that Uber/Lyft's exit led to a 14% decrease in Airbnb occupancy in Austin. In response, hosts decreased the nightly rate by $9.30 and the supply by 4.5%. The authors argue that when Uber/Lyft exited Austin, the transportation costs for most Airbnb guests increased significantly because most Airbnb properties (unlike hotels) have poor access to public transportation. The authors report three key findings: First, demand became less geographically dispersed, falling (increasing) for Airbnb properties with poor (excellent) access to public transportation. Second, demand decreased significantly for low-end properties, whose guests may be more price sensitive, but not for high-end properties. Third, the occupancy of Austin hotels increased after Uber/Lyft's exit; the increase occurred primarily among low-end hotels, which can substitute for low-end Airbnb properties. The results indicate that access to affordable, convenient transportation is critical for the success of home-sharing services in residential areas. Regulations that negatively affect ride-sharing services may also negatively affect the demand for home-sharing services.","Shunyuan Zhang, Dokyun Lee, Param Singh,...","Airbnb, Uber, natural experiment, geographic demand dispersion, demand interactions in sharing economy",1,,,,
Tainted by Stigma: The Interplay of Stigma and Moral Identity in Health Persuasion,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211060854,23-Feb-22,01-Apr,2022,59,2,392,410,"The current research examines the interactive effect of consumers’ moral identity and risk factor stigma on health message effectiveness. The authors theorize that engaging in advocated health behaviors has moral associations; however, a stigmatized risk factor in a message “taints” the morality of the advocated health behavior. Thus, consumers with high (vs. low) moral identity are more likely to comply with health messages when risk factor stigma is low, and this positive moral identity effect is undermined when risk factor stigma is high. The authors test stigma's threat to moral identity by measuring defensive processing (Studies 1 and 2) and the attenuating effect of self-affirmation on the negative effect of stigma (Studies 3 and 4). They apply the stigma-by-association principle to develop and test a messaging intervention (Study 5). The studies suggest that, depending on whether a health message contains stigmatized risk factors, marketers could employ a combination of tactics such as activating moral identity, offering self-affirming message frames, and/or highlighting low-stigma risk factors to bolster message effectiveness.","Chethana Achar, Lea H.

Tracking this market as it evolved through time, the authors find that firms indeed learn to set more profitable prices, that these prices increasingly reflect demand fundamentals, and that prices ultimately converge to levels consistent with (static) profit maximization. The authors further demonstrate that initial pricing mistakes are largest for products whose demand conditions differ the most from those of previously privatized markets, that retailers with previous experience in the category are initially better informed, and that learning is faster for products with more precise sales information. These findings indicate that firm behavior converges to rational models of firm conduct, but such convergence takes time to unfold and plays out differently for different firms. These patterns suggest the important roles of firms’ learning and heterogeneous firm capabilities.","Yufeng Huang, Paul B. Ellickson, Mitchell J.

Accordingly, the authors also propose that prompting consumers to consider reasons why their expenses might be different than usual increases predictions—and therefore prediction accuracy—by bringing atypical expenses to mind.

Although retention and completion rates for nonpaying users have not been promising, these statistics are much brighter for users who pay to receive a certificate upon completing the course. We investigate whether paying for the certificate option can increase engagement with course content. In particular, we consider two effects: (1) the certificate effect, which is the boost in motivation to stay engaged to receive the certificate; and (2) the sunk-cost effect, which arises solely because the user paid for the course. We use data from over 70 courses offered on the Coursera platform and study the engagement of individual participants at different milestones within each course. The panel nature of the data enables us to include controls for intrinsic differences between nonpaying and paying users in terms of their desire to stay engaged. We find evidence that the certificate and sunk-cost effects increase user engagement by approximately 8%–9% and 17%–20%, respectively. Whereas the sunk-cost effect is transient and lasts for only a few weeks after payment, the certificate effect lasts until the participant reaches the grade required to be eligible to receive the certificate. We discuss the implications of our findings for how platforms and content creators may design course milestones and schedule payment of course fees. Given that greater engagement tends to improve learning outcomes, our study serves as an important first step in understanding the role of prices and payment in enabling MOOCs to realize their full potential.","Ali Goli, Pradeep K.

By modeling the heterogeneity across learners pursuing lecture and quiz completion goals, the authors capture different patterns of consumption that correspond to extant theories of goal progress within an empirical field setting. They find that most individuals exhibit a learning style whereby lecture utility changes as an inverted U-shaped function of current progress. This model may also be used as an early detection system to anticipate changes in engagement, and it enables the authors to relate learning styles to final performance outcomes and enrollment in additional courses.

The “Idea Advantage”: How Content Sharing Strategies Impact Engagement in Online Learning Platforms,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211017828,30-Sep-21,01-Feb,2022,59,1,61,78,"In recent years, online learning platforms (e.g., Coursera, edX) have experienced massive growth and have reached nearly 200 million learners. Although their reach is quite large, the impact of these platforms is constrained by a low level of learner engagement. In traditional face-to-face classrooms, educators aim to engage learners by asking them to participate in class discussions and share information about their identity and ideas. However, the effectiveness of these strategies in online learning platforms is uncertain. The authors examine this issue by assessing the impact of two different types of content sharing on learner engagement. The authors conduct a textual analysis of over 12,000 text postings during an 18-month period (Study 1) and a field experiment among over 2,000 learners (Study 2) in a popular Coursera offering by a large U.S. university. The results indicate that asking learners to share ideas (vs. their identity) has a stronger effect on their video consumption and assessment completion. The authors explain this “idea advantage” by suggesting that learners who share ideas (vs. identity) exhibit a greater degree of elaboration. This idea advantage is strongest for learners from English-speaking countries and those new to online learning.","Unnati Narang, Manjit S.

The randomized controlled trial in the context of tutoring services shows that helping service employees (tutors) adapt to students’ learning needs by providing AI-generated diagnoses significantly improves service outcomes measured by academic performance. However, the authors find that some tutors may not utilize AI assistance (i.e., AI aversion), and factors associated with unforeseen barriers to usage (i.e., technology overload) can moderate its impact on outcomes. Interestingly, tutors who significantly contribute to the firm's revenue relied heavily on AI assistance but unexpectedly benefited little from AI in improving service outcomes.

How can established organizations adapt to marketization? To answer this question, the authors study the adaptation of five established religious schools to the marketization of education in Brazil. They develop the novel hybridization strategy of nested coupling and explain that established organizations respond to marketization by balancing competing demands for differentiation and conformity. The authors show how religious schools nest the market logic within the religious logic by reconfiguring their resources to conform to market demands while differentiating themselves through their religious orientation. Nested coupling provides a novel strategic approach for established organizations in marketized or marketizing fields, such as hospitals, museums, and schools, to capitalize on a logic that preexists marketization and to create a unique competitive positioning in the market.","Pierre-Yann Dolbec, Rodrigo B.

Even with student loans, however, the authors find that students psychologically realize the financial costs of a college education long before their loan repayments begin.

Students choose between investments with (1) smaller short-term costs but smaller long-term returns (a lower-cost, lower-return [LC-LR] college) and (2) larger short-term costs but larger long-term returns (a higher-cost, higher-return [HC-HR] college). The authors find that early cost realization increases preferences for LC-LR colleges—preferences that could reduce lifetime earnings—in both simulations and experiments. Preferences for LC-LR colleges are pronounced among financially impatient students and in choice pairs of LC-LR and HC-HR colleges where the equilibrium is set at a low-discount-rate threshold. A return-on-investment strategy, future uncertainty, and debt aversion cannot explain these results.

The Dynamics of Distortion: How Successive Summarization Alters the Retelling of News,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720987147,06-May-21,01-Dec,2021,58,6,1058,1078,"This work advances and tests a theory of how news information evolves as it is successively retold by consumers. Drawing on data from over 11,000 participants across ten experiments, the authors offer evidence that when news is repeatedly retold, it undergoes a stylistic transformation termed “disagreeable personalization,” wherein original facts are increasingly supplanted by opinions and interpretations with a slant toward negativity. The central thesis is that when retellers believe they are more (vs. less) knowledgeable than their recipient about the information they are relaying, they feel more compelled to provide guidance on its meaning and to do so in a persuasive manner. This enhanced motivation to guide persuasively, in turn, leads retellers to not only select the subset of facts they deem most essential but, critically, to provide their interpretations and opinions on those facts, with negativity being used as a means of grabbing their audience’s attention. Implications of this work for research on retelling and consumer information diffusion are explored.","Shiri Melumad, Robert Meyer, Yoon Duk Kim","information diffusion, natural language processing, retelling, social media, word of mouth",64,,,,
Consumer Behavior in the Online Classroom: Using Video Analytics and Machine Learning to Understand the Consumption of Video Courseware,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211042013,15-Nov-21,01-Dec,2021,58,6,1079,1100,"Video is one of the fastest growing online services offered to consumers. The rapid growth of online video consumption brings new opportunities for marketing executives and researchers to analyze consumer behavior. However, video also introduces new challenges. Specifically, analyzing unstructured video data presents formidable methodological challenges that limit the use of multimedia data to generate marketing insights. To address this challenge, the authors propose a novel video feature framework based on machine learning and computer vision techniques, which helps marketers predict and understand the consumption of online video from a content-based perspective. The authors apply this framework to two unique data sets: one provided by MasterClass, consisting of 771 online videos and more than 2.6 million viewing records from 225,580 consumers, and another from Crash Course, consisting of 1,127 videos focusing on more traditional education disciplines. The analyses show that the framework proposed in this article can be used to accurately predict both individual-level consumer behavior and aggregate video popularity in these two very different contexts. The authors discuss how their findings and methods can be used to advance management and marketing research with unstructured video data in other contexts such as video marketing and entertainment analytics.","Mi Zhou, George H.

Construal Matching in Online Search: Applying Text Analysis to Illuminate the Consumer Decision Journey,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720940693,02-Sep-20,01-Dec,2021,58,6,1101,1119,"As consumers move through their decision journey, they adopt different goals (e.g., transactional vs. informational). In this research, the authors propose that consumer goals can be detected through textual analysis of online search queries and that both marketers and consumers can benefit when paid search results and advertisements match consumer search–related goals. In bridging construal level theory and textual analysis, the authors show that consumers at different stages of the decision journey tend to assume different levels of mental construal, or mindsets (i.e., abstract vs. concrete). They find evidence of a fluency-driven matching effect in online search such that when consumer mindsets are more abstract (more concrete), consumers generate textual search queries that use more abstract (more concrete) language. Furthermore, they are more likely to click on search engine results and ad content that matches their mindset, thereby experiencing more search satisfaction and perceiving greater goal progress. Six empirical studies, including a pilot study, a survey, three lab experiments, and a field experiment involving over 128,000 ad impressions provide support for this construal matching effect in online search.","Ashlee Humphreys, Mathew S.

The data set offers a complete picture of both where the shopper is located and the shopper’s field of view and visual fixations during the trip. The authors address two research questions: First, do shoppers have a higher propensity to pay attention to products on their left or right side as they traverse an aisle (i.e., is the right side the “right” side)? Second, do shoppers tend to pay more attention to products at their eye level (i.e., is eye level “buy level”)? The authors utilize the exogenous variations in the direction by which shoppers traverse an aisle to identify lateral bias. The exogenous variation of shoppers’ eye-level positions is used to identify vertical bias. The authors find that shoppers pay more attention to products on their right side when traversing an aisle. Contrary to many practitioners’ belief, eye level is not “buy level”; rather, the product level that has the greatest propensity to capture shoppers’ attention is approximately 14.7 inches below eye level (which is around chest level).","Ming Chen, Raymond R.

A Poisson Factorization Topic Model for the Study of Creative Documents (and Their Summaries),https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720943209,22-Sep-20,01-Dec,2021,58,6,1142,1158,"The author proposes a topic model tailored to the study of creative documents (e.g., academic papers, movie scripts), which extends Poisson factorization in two ways. First, the creativity literature emphasizes the importance of novelty in creative industries. Accordingly, this article introduces a set of residual topics that represent the portion of each document that is not explained by a combination of common topics. Second, creative documents are typically accompanied by summaries (e.g., abstracts, synopses). Accordingly, the author jointly models the content of creative documents and their summaries, and captures systematic variations in topic intensities between the documents and their summaries. This article validates and illustrates the model in three domains: marketing academic papers, movie scripts, and TV show closed captions. It illustrates how the joint modeling of documents and summaries provides some insight into how people summarize creative documents and enhances understanding of the significance of each topic. It shows that the model described produces new measures of distinctiveness that can inform the perennial debate on the relation between novelty and success in creative industries.

This research classifies social media brand imagery and studies user response. Aside from packshots (standalone product images), two types of brand-related selfie images appear online: consumer selfies (featuring brands and consumers’ faces) and an emerging phenomenon the authors term “brand selfies” (invisible consumers holding a branded product). The authors use convolutional neural networks to identify these archetypes and train language models to infer social media response to more than a quarter-million brand-image posts (185 brands on Twitter and Instagram). They find that consumer-selfie images receive more sender engagement (i.e., likes and comments), whereas brand selfies result in more brand engagement, expressed by purchase intentions. These results cast doubt on whether conventional social media metrics are appropriate indicators of brand engagement. Results for display ads are consistent with this observation, with higher click-through rates for brand selfies than for consumer selfies. A controlled lab experiment suggests that self-reference is driving the differential response to selfie images. Collectively, these results demonstrate how (interpretable) machine learning helps extract marketing-relevant information from unstructured multimedia content and that selfie images are a matter of perspective in terms of actual brand engagement.","Jochen Hartmann, Mark Heitmann, Christina Schamp,...","user-generated content, social media, image analysis, deep learning, natural language processing, interpretable machine learning",13,,,,

Exploring this relationship further, in Studies 2, 3, and 4, the author finds that brands can leverage this association, reducing emotionality in brand communications to increase perceived brand status. This strategy is effective because reduced emotionality is associated with high-status communication norms, which evoke high-status reference groups.

Relative Effectiveness of Print and Digital Advertising: A Memory Perspective,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211034438,06-Sep-21,01-Oct,2021,58,5,827,844,"The exponential growth in digital media has recently challenged the value of print media in the overall marketing mix.

In Study 1, using eye tracking and biometric measures during exposure, the authors find stronger encoding and engagement for print ads over digital ads. A week later, participants showed no significant difference in recognizing ads across format, though they better remembered the encoding context of print ads. Notably, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the authors find greater activation in hippocampus and parahippocampal regions for print ads relative to digital ads. Extending these insights, Study 2 demonstrates that participants better remember print ads across contents, context, and brand associations when using snippets as retrieval cues. In addition to establishing the robustness of previous findings, Study 3 provides further evidence that the observed memory advantage for print ads is primarily due to superior encoding during initial exposure. From a practical perspective, these findings suggest that marketers should not discount the value of print media in advertising, despite the rapid growth of digital media and communications.","Vinod Venkatraman, Angelika Dimoka, Khoi Vo,...","print media, digital media, memory recall, memory recognition, functional magnetic resonance imaging",12,,,,
The Minimum Wage and Consumer Nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211023475,06-Sep-21,01-Oct,2021,58,5,845,869,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that one in nine U.S. households is “food insecure”: unable to purchase sufficient, or healthy food. Public policy advocates and politicians have pointed to the prevailing federal minimum wage as a culprit, labeling it a “starvation wage.” This study examines whether and to what extent increases to the minimum wage have improved the quantity and nutritional quality of food purchased by minimum wage earners, and what implications these potential changes in consumer behavior have for marketers. The authors show that households likely to be earning the minimum wage increase their calories purchased in response to minimum wage increases, and that these gains are predominantly found among households purchasing the least amount of food prior to the minimum wage rising. Although the authors do not find evidence that the average household improves the nutritional content of calories purchased, they do find evidence that the least healthy households (as measured by past purchases) buy more healthy foods in response to rising minimum wages. Overall, the findings suggest that higher minimum wages may not only help households afford more calories but also encourage some households to purchase more healthy calories. In addition, the authors find an increased openness among minimum wage households to purchasing new grocery items. This openness to trying previously unpurchased products offers promotion and product line planning opportunities to manufacturers. It also offers retailers with a nutrition-friendly brand image an opportunity to nudge consumers toward purchasing more healthy foods.","Mike Palazzolo, Adithya Pattabhiramaiah","food insecurity, marketing and public policy, minimum wage, nutritional inequality, nutrition and nudges",31,,,,
How Association with Physical Waste Attenuates Consumer Preferences for Rescue-Based Food,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211031243,08-Sep-21,01-Oct,2021,58,5,870,887,"In an effort to combat food waste, many firms have introduced rescue-based foods (RBFs), which are made from ingredients that are safe to eat but would otherwise be wasted, often due to aesthetic issues or oversupply. Although the benefits of RBF are varied, some firms adopt strategies that highlight RBF’s waste-reduction benefits, such as reduced landfill use or lower environmental impact. This research posits that when firms adopt strategies that highlight associations between physical waste and RBF, those associations can generate negative mental imagery, which can trigger disgust and mitigate positive consumer attitudes toward RBF. When such associations are not present, demand is consistent with demand for conventional foods. The authors find support for the role of mental imagery in this demand mitigation process, with some promotional appeals stimulating thoughts of physical waste. Counterintuitively, this research reveals that when marketers adopt the common practice of using environmental benefit appeals that can trigger physical waste associations, such as the color green, consumer demand for RBF diminishes. Conversely, focusing on the societal benefits or limiting the number of cues available to create physical waste associations generates consumer demand for these foods on a level equivalent to that of conventional food.","Anna de Visser-Amundson, John Peloza, Mirella Kleijnen","corporate social responsibility, food waste, mental imagery, rescue-based food, sustainability",2,,,,

First, they argue that the move from waterfalling to header bidding was a revenue-improving move for publishers in the old regime when exchanges employed second-price auctions. Given the publisher move to header bidding, the authors show that exchanges move from second-price to first-price auctions to increase their expected clearing prices. Interestingly, when all exchanges move to first-price auctions, each exchange faces stronger competition from other exchanges, and some exchanges may end up with lower revenue than when all exchanges use second-price auctions; yet all exchanges move to first-price auctions in the unique equilibrium of the game. The authors show that the new regime hinders the exchanges’ ability to differentiate in equilibrium. Furthermore, it allows the publishers to achieve the revenue of the optimal mechanism despite not having direct access to the advertisers.","Stylianos Despotakis, R.

The authors examine whether a boost in consumers’ self-perceived attractiveness influences subsequent choices in domains unrelated to beauty. Across six studies, the authors find converging evidence that a boost in consumers’ self-perceived attractiveness enhances their general self-confidence and reduces preference uncertainty, resulting in less reliance on the choice context and thus fewer choices of compromise, all-average, and default options. The findings further show that consumers use self-confidence as metacognitive information for inferring preference uncertainty in subsequent decisions. This process is a misattribution that can be attenuated when consumers attribute their self-confidence to the self-perceived attractiveness.

Using data on U.S. households’ subscription choices and operators’ advertising decisions, the authors document both demand- and supply-side conditions conducive to the growth of the satellite operators. First, the authors find that consumers in this market were sensitive to advertising, and especially so to that of the satellite operators (ad elasticities of about .05–.06 for satellite operators vs. .02 for cable operators). The authors employ a border strategy to demonstrate advertising-elastic demand and discuss its robustness to potential threats to identification. Second, the authors provide suggestive evidence that a form of asymmetric cost efficiencies in television advertising benefited the entrants more than the incumbents. Specifically, the unit costs of local advertising tend to be higher than those of national advertising, which likely allowed the satellite operators to better leverage their national presence with (cheaper) national advertising.

The present research tests the impact of a feedback format that is more targeted at how consumers select and revise their meals: real-time aggregation of calorie content to provide dynamic feedback about meal calories via a traffic light label. Because these labels intuitively signal when a meal shifts from healthy to unhealthy (via the change from green to a yellow or red light), they prompt decision makers to course-correct in real time, before they finalize their choice. Results from five preregistered experiments (N = 11,900) show that providing real-time traffic light feedback about the total caloric content of a meal reduces calories in orders, even compared with similar aggregated feedback in numeric format. Patterns of ordering reveal this effect to be driven by people revising high-calorie orders more frequently, leading them to choose fewer and lower-calorie items. Consumers also like traffic light aggregation, indicating greater satisfaction with their order and greater intentions to return to restaurants that use them. The authors discuss how dynamic feedback using intuitive signals could yield benefits in contexts beyond food choice.","Eric M. VanEpps, Andras Molnar, Julie S.

Overcoming the Cold Start Problem of Customer Relationship Management Using a Probabilistic Machine Learning Approach,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211032938,17-Sep-21,01-Oct,2021,58,5,981,1006,"The success of customer relationship management programs ultimately depends on the firm's ability to identify and leverage differences across customers—a difficult task when firms attempt to manage new customers, for whom only the first purchase has been observed. The lack of repeated observations for these customers poses a structural challenge for firms to infer unobserved differences across them. This is what the authors call the “cold start” problem of customer relationship management, whereby companies have difficulties leveraging existing data when they attempt to make inferences about customers at the beginning of their relationship. The authors propose a solution to the cold start problem by developing a probabilistic machine learning modeling framework that leverages the information collected at the moment of acquisition. The main aspect of the model is that it flexibly captures latent dimensions that govern the behaviors observed at acquisition as well as future propensities to buy and to respond to marketing actions using deep exponential families. The model can be integrated with a variety of demand specifications and is flexible enough to capture a wide range of heterogeneity structures. The authors validate their approach in a retail context and empirically demonstrate the model's ability to identify high-value customers as well as those most sensitive to marketing actions right after their first purchase.","Nicolas Padilla, Eva Ascarza","customer relationship management, deep exponential families, probabilistic machine learning, cold start problem",11,,,,

In this research, seven studies, including an eye tracking study, a Facebook Ads field experiment, and lab and online experiments—all using real ads across diverse contexts—demonstrate that slow motion (vs. natural speed) can backfire and undercut product appeal by making the influence agent’s behavior seem more intentional and extrinsically motivated. The authors rule out several alternative explanations by showing that the effect attenuates for individuals with lower intentionality bias, is mitigated under cognitive load, and reverses when ads use nonhuman influence agents. The authors conclude by highlighting the potential for cross-pollination between visual information processing and social cognition research, particularly in contexts such as persuasion and trust, and they discuss managerial implications for visual marketing, especially on digital and social platforms.","Yunlu Yin, Jayson S.

The authors further document an important boundary condition of the first inference: the identified effect reverses in high-risk domains (e.g., products that involve high physical risk) due to consumer perceptions that the crowdfunding model lacks sufficient professionalism to mitigate risk. With regard to the second inference, the authors find that the positive crowdfunding effect is particularly strong among consumers who value social equality.

This is because the stronger team member will exert higher effort under the maximum contract compared with the average contract, and this increase exceeds the decrease in the weaker team member’s effort. The authors validate the theoretical predictions by employing two laboratory experiments to provide a causal test of the theory and two randomized field experiments to deliver additional corroborating evidence.

These ABIs are based on salespeople’s activity measures derived from their call reports. Despite their prevalence and theory-based expectations, there is a distinct lack of empirical work studying the sales productivity effects of ABI pay. With the cooperation of a large pharmaceutical firm, the authors conducted a three-year-long intervention based on a “treatment-removal” design. Their first intervention added modest ABI pay for frontline salespeople and their supervisors across 305 sales territories; the second intervention removed ABI pay from the salespeople; and the third intervention removed ABI pay from the supervisors as well, returning to the status quo. Using detailed territory-level data from the intervention in conjunction with syndicated market-level data and employing synthetic control procedures, the authors find sales gains of around 6%–9% from each of the two ABI interventions relative to the no-ABI baseline. These effects are moderated by the number of salespeople in a territory, with territories with more salespeople showing larger effects. Analyses of activity effects show that when supervisors are paid ABIs, they exert behavior control downward on salespeople. Managerially, both ABI schemes improve performance over an output-only pay plan. Between the two, a rudimentary gross profit impact calculation shows that ABIs targeted at supervisors alone are more efficient than ABIs targeted at both salespeople and their supervisors. The results support tying compensation to call reports despite the potential for self-serving biases in these measures because supervisors are able to exercise more behavior control with ABIs.","Raghunath Singh Rao, Madhu Viswanathan, George John,...","activity-based incentives, field experiments, sales compensation, principal-agent theory, synthetic control",5,,,,
How (and When) the Presence of Food Decreases Enjoyment of Customer Experiences,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211010465,22-Jun-21,01-Aug,2021,58,4,705,720,"Consumers frequently engage in experiences (e.g., listening to music) in the presence of delicious food. Ten studies show that the presence (vs. absence) of such food decreases the enjoyment of a concurrent (target) experience across a wide array of consumption activities, such as listening to music, evaluating pictures, and coloring. The presence (vs. absence) of food prompts mental imagery of consuming that food, which decreases engagement with the target experience, resulting in lower enjoyment. Consistent with prior work on mental imagery, the effect occurs only for food that is considered tasty; when a food’s functional benefits are highlighted, the effect disappears. In addition, the effect can be triggered in the absence of food when participants are explicitly instructed to engage in mental imagery. The authors demonstrate the role of engagement by showing that the valence of the target experience moderates this effect, such that the presence of food decreases enjoyment of positive experiences but increases enjoyment of negative experiences. This work contributes to previous research on mental imagery and delayed consumption by highlighting the need to focus on how the presence of food affects concurrent experiences and provides important managerial insights given the proliferation of tasty food to enhance customer experience.","Emily N.

To uncover differences in behavior across consumers and to provide policy recommendations at a segment level, the authors present a structural model where consumers simultaneously choose the frequency and intensity of their alcohol consumption. They find differences across consumers in their behaviors, notably with respect to income and age. They conduct policy simulations to compare the effectiveness of alcohol-related policies to counter the adverse effects of recessions on the health of vulnerable groups such as low-income and elderly populations.","Hailey Hayeon Joo, Minki Kim, Jungmin Lee,...","alcohol consumption, business cycle, consumer heterogeneity, frequency, intensity",11,,,,
Interacting User-Generated Content Technologies: How Questions and Answers Affect Consumer Reviews,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211020274,23-Jun-21,01-Aug,2021,58,4,742,761,"This article studies the question and answer (Q&A) technology of electronic commerce platforms, an increasingly common form of user-generated content that allows consumers to publicly ask product-specific questions and receive responses, either from the platform or from other customers. Using data from a major online retailer, the authors show that Q&As complement consumer reviews: unlike reviews, questions are primarily asked prepurchase and focus on clarification of product attributes rather than discussion of quality; answers convey fit-specific information in a predominantly sentiment-free way. Drawing on these observations, the authors hypothesize that Q&As mitigate product fit uncertainty, leading to better matches between products and consumers and, therefore, improved product ratings. Indeed, when products suffering from fit mismatch start receiving Q&As, their subsequent ratings improve by approximately .1 to .5 stars, and the fraction of negative reviews that discuss fit-related issues declines. The extent of the rating increase due to Q&As is proportional to the probability that purchasers will experience fit mismatch without Q&A. These findings suggest that, by resolving product fit uncertainty in an e-commerce setting, the addition of Q&As can be a viable way for retailers to improve ratings of products that have incurred low ratings due to customer–product fit mismatch.","Shrabastee Banerjee, Chrysanthos Dellarocas, Georgios Zervas","e-commerce, Q&A, reputation systems, user-generated content",4,,,,
Religious Belief, Religious Priming, and Negative Word of Mouth,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211011196,26-May-21,01-Aug,2021,58,4,762,781,"This research examines the effects of religious belief and religious priming on negative word-of-mouth (NWOM) behavior. Drawing on social exchange and norm paradigms, the authors theorize and find evidence of the unique effects of religious belief and religious priming on NWOM in everyday service failure encounters. Specifically, they find that religious belief is associated with higher NWOM, driven by a greater sensitivity to violations of fairness norms, which in turn reduces forgiveness. However, exposure to religious priming attenuates NWOM among more religious consumers by reducing sensitivity to violations of fairness norms, which in turn enhances forgiveness. A field study involving over 1.2 million online reviews of actual restaurant experiences, in addition to four lab studies, provides support for the theorized effects. This study sheds light on the religion–forgiveness discrepancy by establishing the mediating role of sensitivity to fairness violations on the relationship between religion and forgiveness in the NWOM context. Further, the results demonstrate the importance of religion as a strategic variable in the management of service failure experiences, providing theoretical implications for the literature on the effects of religion on consumer behavior.","Riza Casidy, Adam Duhachek, Vishal Singh,...","negative word of mouth, online reviews, religious belief, religious priming, service failure",11,,
Strategic Polarization in Group Interactions,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211016389,22-Jun-21,01-Aug,2021,58,4,782,800,"The authors study the phenomenon of strategic group polarization, in which members take more extreme actions than their preferences. The analysis is relevant for a broad range of formal and informal group settings, including social media, online platforms, sales teams, corporate and academic committees, and political action committees. In the model, agents with private preferences choose a public action (voice opinions), and the mean of their actions represents the group’s realized outcome. The agents face a trade-off between influencing the group decision and truth-telling. In a simultaneous-move game, agents strategically shade their actions toward the extreme. The strategic group influence motive can create substantial polarization in actions and group decisions even when the preferences are relatively moderate. Compared with a simultaneous game, a randomized-sequential-actions game lowers polarization when agents’ preferences are relatively similar. Sequential actions can even lead to moderation if the later agents have moderate preferences. Endogenizing the order of moves (through a first-price sealed-bid auction) always increases polarization, but it is also welfare enhancing. These findings can help group leaders, firms, and platforms design mechanisms that moderate polarization, such as the choice of speaking order, the group size, and the knowledge members have of others’ preferences and actions.","Ganesh Iyer, Hema Yoganarasimhan","polarization, collective decision making, social choice, lobbying, group interactions",1,,,,
The Performance Impact of Core-Component Outsourcing: Insights from the LCD TV Industry,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211010766,26-May-21,01-Aug,2021,58,4,801,826,"Firms in technology markets often outsource the manufacture of core components—components that are central to product performance and comprise a substantial portion of product costs. Despite the strategic importance of core-component outsourcing, there is little empirical evidence (and many conflicting opinions) about its impact on consumer demand. The authors address this gap with an examination of panel data from the flat panel TV industry, across key regions globally. Results from their estimation indicate that core-component outsourcing reduces the firm’s ability to be on the technological frontier; this hurts demand, because the authors’ estimates suggest that consumers care about firms being on the frontier. However, such outsourcing also reduces costs. Finally, the authors find that outsourcing increases the intensity of competition in the marketplace.

Happiness Begets Money: Emotion and Engagement in Live Streaming,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211002477,20-Apr-21,01-Jun,2021,58,3,417,438,"Live streaming offers an unprecedented opportunity for content creators (broadcasters) to deliver their content to consumers (viewers) in real time. In a live stream, viewers may send virtual gifts (tips) to the broadcaster and engage with likes and chats free of charge. These activities reflect viewers’ underlying emotion and are likely to be affected by the broadcaster’s emotion. This article examines the role of emotion in interactive and dynamic business settings such as live streaming. To account for the possibility that broadcaster emotion, viewer emotion, and viewer activities influence each other, the authors estimate a panel vector autoregression model on data at the minute level from 1,450 live streams. The results suggest that a happier broadcaster makes the audience happier and begets intensified viewer activities, in particular tips. In addition, broadcasters reciprocate viewer engagement with more smiles. Further analyses suggest that these effects are pronounced only after a live stream has been active for a while, and they manifest only in streams by broadcasters who have more experience, receive more tips, or are more popular in past live streams. These results help platforms and broadcasters optimize marketing interventions such as broadcaster emotion enhancement in live streaming and quantify the financial returns.","Yan Lin, Dai Yao, Xingyu Chen","digital marketing, emotion, engagement, live streaming, social media, text analysis, video analysis",2,,,,
Navigating Shared Consumption Experiences: Clarity About a Partner’s Interests Increases Enjoyment,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211002818,12-Apr-21,01-Jun,2021,58,3,439,455,"Consumers frequently engage in activities with others, such as visiting an art gallery with a friend or going to a sports match with a family member, and they tend to assume that sharing experiences with another person will make these activities more enjoyable.

In a series of studies in which consumers engage in real consumption experiences, the authors show that lack of clarity about a partner’s interests can distract consumers, making it difficult for them to focus on the shared activity and reducing their enjoyment of shared experiences relative to solo experiences. Notably, simple interventions can increase clarity of a partner’s interests and consumers’ enjoyment of shared activities, providing tools for service providers who want to retain customers and benefit from positive word of mouth.","Yuechen Wu, Rebecca W.

Two pilot studies show that most marketers have a surprisingly strong lay intuition about the existence of this inference bias, admit that they are frequently affected by it, and try to avoid it when predicting consumer preferences. Moreover, the pilot studies indicate that most marketers use a very natural and straightforward approach to avoid the false consensus effect in practice, that is, they simply try to “suppress” (i.e., ignore) their personal preferences when predicting consumer preferences. Ironically, four subsequent studies show that this frequently used tactic can backfire and increase marketers’ susceptibility to the false consensus effect. Specifically, the results suggest that these backfire effects are most likely to occur for marketers with a low level of preference certainty. In contrast, the results imply that preference suppression does not backfire but instead decreases the false consensus effect for marketers with a high level of preference certainty.

Using a large consumer panel data set of credit and employment information, the authors find that receiving a bonus increases auto loan demand by 21%. These loans, however, are associated with higher risk, as the delinquency rate increases by 18.5%–31.4% depending on different measures. In contrast, an increase in consumers’ base salary will increase their demand for auto loans but not their delinquency. By comparing consumers with bonuses with those without bonuses, the authors find that bonus payments lead to both demand expansion and demand shifting on auto loans.

The authors observe both individual-level and contextual-level variation in the degree to which consumers feel psychological ownership of borrowed money, and variation on this dimension predicts willingness to borrow money for discretionary purchases. At an individual level, psychological ownership of borrowed money is distinct from other individual factors such as debt aversion, financial literacy, income, intertemporal discounting, materialism, propensity to plan, self-control, spare money, and tightwad–spendthrift tendencies, and it predicts willingness to borrow above and beyond these factors. At a contextual level, the authors document systematic differences in psychological ownership between different debt types. They show that these differences in psychological ownership manifest in consumers’ online search behavior and explain consumers’ differential interest in borrowing across debt types. Finally, the authors demonstrate that psychological ownership of borrowed money is malleable, such that framing debt using language lower in psychological ownership can reduce consumers’ propensity to borrow.","Eesha Sharma, Stephanie Tully, Cynthia Cryder","consumer finances, debt, financial decision making, mental accounting, psychological ownership",20,,,,

The authors examine whether a firm relies on information from benchmark leaders or similar peers to resolve disclosure uncertainty. A novel identification strategy, which uses partially overlapping strategic groups to mitigate simultaneity and correlated unobservables, shows robust evidence for herding effects among peer firms in the same strategic group. Moreover, firms are more likely to resolve disclosure uncertainty from similar peers rather than from benchmark leaders.

Incentives Increase Relative Positivity of Review Content and Enjoyment of Review Writing,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211010439,23-Apr-21,01-Jun,2021,58,3,539,558,"A series of controlled experiments examine how the strategy of incentivizing reviews influences consumers’ expressions of positivity. Incentivized (vs. unincentivized) reviews contained a greater proportion of positive relative to negative emotion across a variety of product and service experiences (e.g., videos, service providers, consumer packaged goods companies). This effect occurred for both financial and nonfinancial incentives and when assessing review content across multiple natural language processing tools and human judgments. Incentives influence review content by modifying the experience of writing reviews. That is, when incentives are associated with review writing, they cause the positive affect that results from receiving an incentive to transfer to the review-writing experience, making review writing more enjoyable. In line with this process, the effect of an incentive on review positivity attenuates when incentives are weakly (vs. strongly) associated with review writing (i.e., incentive for “participating in an experiment” vs. “writing a review”) and when the incentive does not transfer positive affect (i.e., when an incentive is provided by a disliked company). By examining when incentives do (vs. do not) adjust the relative positivity of written reviews, this research offers theoretical insight into the literature on incentives, motivation, and word of mouth, with practical implications for managers.","Kaitlin Woolley, Marissa A.

How Life-Role Transitions Shape Consumer Responses to Brand Extensions,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720986546,17-Mar-21,01-Jun,2021,58,3,579,594,"Life-role transition is a state wherein people pass through different life stages, involving changes in identities, roles, and responsibilities. Across six studies, the current research shows that consumers under life-role transition have more favorable attitudes toward distant (i.e., low- or moderate-fit) brand extensions than consumers who are not under life-role transition. The effect is driven by a sense of self-concept ambiguity associated with life-role transition, which subsequently prompts dialectical thinking that helps improve perceived fit between a parent brand and its extension, finally resulting in more favorable brand extension evaluation. This effect diminishes for (1) near (i.e., high-fit) brand extensions that do not require dialectical thinking for perceiving fit; (2) for sub-brand (vs. direct brand) architecture, for which there is less of a need to use dialectical thinking to reconcile the inconsistencies between a parent brand and its extension; and (3) when consumers perceive they have resources to cope with the life-role transition, which attenuates self-concept ambiguity. This research offers important theoretical and managerial insights by focusing on life-role transition—an important aspect of consumers’ lives that has been largely underresearched—and by demonstrating how and why it elicits more favorable attitudes toward brand extensions.","Lei Su, Alokparna (Sonia) Basu Monga, Yuwei Jiang","brand extensions, dialectical thinking, life-role transition, self-concept ambiguity",2,,,,

Because agentic men are more self-focused, their payment decisions are motivated by economic factors, resulting in lower payments. Conversely, communal women are more other-focused, and their payment decisions are motivated by both social and economic factors, resulting in higher payments.

Because beliefs are rarely observed, researchers typically assume that consumers have rational expectations or update beliefs consistent with Bayesian updating. These assumptions are restrictive and do not enable the researcher or the retailer to price discriminate among consumers on the basis of heterogeneity in beliefs. The authors use Monte Carlo experiments to show how these assumptions affect estimates of search cost. Next, they design an incentive-aligned online study in which participants search over the price of a homogeneous good, and the authors elicit distributions of price beliefs before and after each search. Drawing on data collected from a nationally representative panel, they find substantial heterogeneity in prior price beliefs, such that participants update their beliefs in response to search outcomes but deviate from Bayesian updating in that they underreact to new information. Importantly, the authors show that (1) assuming Bayesian updating does not significantly bias search cost estimates at the aggregate level if the researcher accounts for heterogeneous prior beliefs, (2) eliciting heterogeneity in prior expected prices is much more important than eliciting heterogeneity in prior price uncertainty, and (3) a retailer can increase profits through third-degree price discrimination by recognizing the heterogeneity in prior beliefs.","Pranav Jindal, Anocha Aribarg","Bayesian updating, consumer search, price beliefs, rational expectations, search costs, sequential search",1,,,,

A consumer processes both “confirmatory” and “disconfirmatory” information to their prior belief, but to different degrees under different conditions. In general, if the consumer has an extreme prior, or if the unit cost of processing information is high such that only a small amount of information is optimally processed, they process more confirmatory than disconfirmatory information; this offers a rational explanation for the phenomenon known as “confirmation bias.” The authors also find that a seller can benefit by influencing the consumer’s attention allocation by strategically choosing how much favorable and unfavorable information to make available for the consumer to process and by influencing the information processing cost, where the optimal strategy depends on the seller’s ability to adjust product price. Surprisingly, a seller has a lower incentive to suppress unfavorable information when the consumer has a worse prior belief about product fit.

Making the World a Better Place: How Crowdfunding Increases Consumer Demand for Social-Good Products,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720970445,22-Dec-20,01-Apr,2021,58,2,363,376,"Crowdfunding has emerged as an alternative means of financing new ventures wherein a large number of individuals collectively back a project.

Six studies demonstrate that compared with a traditional purchase, crowdfunding more strongly activates an interdependent mindset and, as a result, increases consumer demand for social-good products (i.e., products with positive social and/or environmental impact). The research further highlights that an active involvement in the crowdfunding process is necessary to increase demand for social-good products: when a previously crowdfunded product is already to market, the effect is eliminated.

Uncertainty Evokes Consumers’ Preference for Brands Incongruent with their Global–Local Citizenship Identity,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720972956,25-Jan-21,01-Apr,2021,58,2,400,415,"This research demonstrates that under states of certainty, consumers with a relatively stronger global (local) identity prefer global (local) brands, whereas under states of uncertainty, consumers with a relatively stronger global (local) identity prefer local (global) brands. This effect occurs because uncertainty (certainty) activates a divergent (convergent) thinking style, which results in a preference for options that are more distant from (closer to) the identity to which consumers associate more strongly. The effect holds both when individuals’ global–local citizenship identity is measured and when it is manipulated. The research further establishes an important boundary condition for the effect. The effect holds in the citizenship identity context because people normally associate themselves with both local and global citizenship identities, and situational or dispositional factors only influence the degree to which they associate with each identity. The effect does not surface when individuals construe their local–global citizenship identities as interfering, meaning they conceive that holding one identity conflicts with holding the other.","Sharon Ng, Ali Faraji-Rad, Rajeev Batra","globalization, branding, identity, uncertainty, creativity, divergent thinking",2,,,,
A Near-Optimal Bidding Strategy for Real-Time Display Advertising Auctions,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720968547,03-Dec-20,01-Feb,2021,58,1,1,21,"This article introduces a near-optimal bidding algorithm for use in real-time display advertising auctions. These auctions constitute a dominant distribution channel for internet display advertising and a potential funding model for addressable media. The proposed efficient, implementable learning algorithm is proven to rapidly converge to the optimal strategy while achieving zero regret and constituting a competitive equilibrium. This is the first algorithmic solution to the online knapsack problem to offer such theoretical guarantees without assuming a priori knowledge of object values or costs. Furthermore, it meets advertiser requirements by accommodating any valuation metric while satisfying budget constraints. Across a series of 100 simulated and 10 real-world campaigns, the algorithm delivers 98% of the value achievable with perfect foresight and outperforms the best available alternative by 11%. Finally, we show how the algorithm can be augmented to simultaneously estimate impression values and learn the bidding policy. Across a series of simulations, we show that the total regret delivered under this dual objective is less than that from any competing algorithm required only to learn the bidding policy.","Srinivas Tunuguntla, Paul R.

The Impact of Soda Taxes: Pass-Through, Tax Avoidance, and Nutritional Effects,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720969401,21-Dec-20,01-Feb,2021,58,1,22,49,"The authors analyze the impact of a tax on sweetened beverages using a unique data set of prices, quantities sold, and nutritional information across several thousand taxed and untaxed beverages for a large set of stores in Philadelphia and its surrounding area. The tax is passed through at an average rate of 97%, leading to a 34% price increase. Demand in the taxed area decreases by 46% in response to the tax. Cross-shopping to stores outside of Philadelphia offsets more than half of the reduction in sales in the city and decreases the net reduction in sales of taxed beverages to only 22%.

In the field study, familiarity—operationalized as either consumption frequency or subjective product knowledge—increased the overall effect of categorization congruency and strengthened its pathway through perceived variety (vs. the one through complexity).

Approaches have been developed to ensure that research subjects provide honest and thoughtful responses. However, to reduce costs, researchers increasingly collect data online, under conditions that compromise the value of the information provided. Objective measures related to how the study is completed, such as latency (how quickly answers are given), can only be tied to other objective measures (such as the consistency of the answers), but ultimately their relationship to the subject’s utility function is questionable. To address this problem, the authors introduce a mixture modeling framework that clusters subjects based on variances. The proposed model naturally groups subjects based on their internal consistency. The authors argue that a higher level of internal consistency (i.e., lower variance) reflects more engaged consumers who have sufficient experience with the product category and choice task. “Gremlins,” in contrast, behave such that the noise in their responses overwhelms any signal, leading to a lack of predictive power.

Exposure to an increasing number of prior ideas thus heightens individuals’ perceived constraints of expressing ideas and harms creative performance (Studies 2 and 3). Furthermore, creative performance monotonically reduces with an increasing number of prior ideas (Study 4). A final study demonstrates that showing only a limited number of ideas as well as grouping prior ideas offer actionable ways to reduce prior ideas’ harmful influence (Study 5).

The Effect of Information Disclosure on Industry Payments to Physicians,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720972106,17-Dec-20,01-Feb,2021,58,1,115,140,"In 2019, U.S. pharmaceutical companies paid $3.6 billion to physicians in the form of gifts to promote their drugs. To curb inappropriate financial relationships between health care providers and firms, several state laws require firms to publicly declare the payments they make to physicians. In 2013, this disclosure law was rolled out to all 50 states. The authors investigate the causal impact of this increased transparency on subsequent payments between firms and physicians. While firms and physicians were informed of the disclosure regulation at data collection, complete transparency did not occur until the data were published online. The authors estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects of the online data disclosure exploiting the phased rollout of the disclosure laws across states, facilitated by recent advances in machine learning methods. Using a 29-month national panel covering $100 million in payments between 16 antidiabetic brands and 50,000 physicians, the authors find that the monthly payments changed insignificantly, on average, due to disclosure. However, the average null effect masks some unintended consequences of disclosure, wherein payments may have increased for more expensive drugs and among physicians who prescribed more heavily.

Under the proposed approach, the firm delegates sales incentive decisions to the manager within restrictive constraints. She can then request relaxed constraints by fulfilling certain requirements. The author shows how these constraints and requirements can be set to ensure the firm’s best possible outcome given the manager’s information. Thus, this “request mechanism” offers an efficient, reliable alternative to approaches often used in practice to incorporate managerial input, such as internal negotiations and behind-the-scenes lobbying.

Using data from U.S. public utility firms, the authors show that even when customer satisfaction does not affect future revenues, it does positively predict future profitability by reducing utility firm operating costs. More specifically, they find that higher satisfaction reduces the costs of utility firm distribution, customer service, and sales and general administration expenses. These findings and additional post hoc evidence are consistent with the notion that customer satisfaction (1) generates efficiency-enhancing benefits for utility firms by lowering the direct and employee engagement costs of dealing with dissatisfied customers and (2) fosters greater trust and cooperation from customers.

The two-stage and embarrassingly parallel algorithm is asymptotically unbiased in the number of consumers, retains the flexibility of a standard MCMC algorithm, and is easy to implement. The authors show that the distributed MCMC algorithm is faster and more efficient than a single-machine algorithm by at least an order of magnitude.

Interpreting consumers’ search phrases renders a better understanding of their purchase intentions, which is critical for marketing success. In this article, the authors develop an integrated model to connect the latent topics embedded in consumers’ search phrases to their website visits and purchase decisions. Using a unique data set containing more than 8,000 search phrases submitted by consumers, the model identifies latent topics underlying the searches that led consumers to the firm’s website. Compared with a model lacking any textual information from consumers’ search phrases, a model using textual data in a heuristic approach, and a model based on the latent Dirichlet allocation, the proposed model provides a better evaluation of a consumer’s position on the path to purchase and achieves much better predictive accuracy, which could in turn substantially increase the firm’s revenue. The authors also extend the discussion to aggregators, affiliated websites, and segments of consumers who are exposed to the firm’s outbound ads.

Where Do You Want to Go for Dinner?

The authors document a robust preference expression asymmetry wherein “requestors” soliciting others’ consumption preferences (e.g., “Where do you want to go for dinner?”) desire preference expressions (e.g., “Let’s go to this restaurant”), whereas “responders” instead do not express preferences (e.g., “Anywhere is fine with me”). This asymmetry generalizes under a broad set of situations and occurs because the requestor and responder roles differ in their foci. Compared to responders, requestors are more focused on mitigating the difficulty of arriving at a decision, whereas compared to requestors, responders are more focused on conveying likability by appearing easygoing. Responders thus behave suboptimally, incurring a “preference cost” (when masking preferences) and a “social friction cost” (requestors favor responders who express preferences). Requestors can elicit preference expression by conveying their own dislike of decision making, which increases responders’ focus on mitigating decision difficulty. The authors conclude by discussing the framework’s contributions to looking “under the hood” of joint consumption decisions.","Peggy J. Liu, Kate E.

A number of industries have reacted to this change by shifting their attention to earning profits in aftermarkets: products and services that augment the main purchase (e.g., add-ons, insurance, financing, service and maintenance). In these aftermarkets, firms often retain an information advantage, even if information asymmetries are eliminated from the main purchase. This has given rise to an interesting setting untapped by prior research: information “symmetry” in the front end (main purchase) and information “asymmetry” in the back end (aftermarket). The authors argue that symmetry in the front end provides an opportunity to build trust, as the knowledgeable customer can verify the information disclosed by the seller. In an observational study in the automotive industry, the authors find that customers to whom the salesperson revealed the cost of a car at the beginning of the negotiation spent significantly more in the back end than others. As corroborated in subsequent studies, this effect holds only when cost is disclosed at the beginning of the negotiation and when customers can verify the cost information.","Yashar Atefi, Michael Ahearne, Sebastian Hohenberg,...","aftermarkets, information asymmetry, information disclosure, negotiation, trust",44,,,,

Whereas prior research has shown that a default can affect what consumers purchase by promoting choice of the preselected option, the influence of defaults is more nuanced when consumers make a series of related choices. In such a setting, consumer preferences may evolve across choices due to “spillover” effects from one choice to subsequent choices. The authors hypothesize that defaults systematically attenuate choice spillover effects because accepting a default is a more passive process than either choosing a nondefault option in the presence of a default or making a choice in the absence of a default. Three experiments and a field study provide compelling evidence for such default-induced changes in choice spillover effects. The findings show that firms’ setting of high-price defaults with the aim of influencing consumers to choose more expensive products can backfire through the attenuation of spillover. In addition to advancing the understanding of the interplay between defaults and preference dynamics, insights from this research have important practical implications for firms applying defaults in sequential choices.","Bas Donkers, Benedict G.C.

Whereas direct channel usage predominantly lowers agency conflicts in terms of information asymmetry and sales partner moral hazard, indirect channel usage amplifies moral hazard concerns. How those sales partner effects translate into manufacturer performance outcomes critically depends on governance mechanisms, confirming predictions from governance value analysis: formalization enhances performance outcomes for manufacturers in the case of indirect channel usage but diminishes performance in the case of direct channel usage. The authors observe converse effects for centralization and information exchange: centralization and information exchange enhance outcomes of direct channel usage but diminish outcomes of indirect channel usage.

Should Your Brand Pick a Side?

Moreover, research on identity-based consumption and negativity bias suggests that corporate political advocacy (CPA) is more likely to repel existing customers who oppose the CPA than to attract new customers who support it, implying that the net effect will be negative even if consumers overall are evenly divided in their support/opposition. In this research, the authors posit that despite this negativity bias in individual-level choice, the net effect of CPA at the market level is determined by a sorting process that benefits small-share brands and hurts large-share brands. This is because having few customers to lose and many to gain can offset the risk of the negativity bias in consumers’ identity-driven responses to CPA, potentially leading to a net influx of customers for small-share brands. Five experiments provide support for this theorizing and identify authenticity as a necessary condition for small share brands to benefit.","Chris Hydock, Neeru Paharia, Sean Blair","brand activism, choice share, corporate political advocacy, identity-based consumption, market share, negativity bias, political orientation",5,,,,

The authors identify one such cue: the number of users the prospective influencer is following. Using a combination of real-world data analysis and controlled lab experiments, they show that following fewer others, conditional on having a substantial number of followers, has a positive effect on a social media user’s perceived influence. Further, the authors find greater perceived influence impacts engagement with the content shared in terms of other users exhibiting more favorable attitudes toward it (i.e., likes) and a greater propensity to spread it (i.e., retweets).

The authors propose a solution to the initial conditions problem that samples the initial states as auxiliary variables in a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure.

The empirical analyses show that strategic considerations in entry and expansion, ignored in the literature on franchising, appear to influence an organizational-form decision: firms rely more on company-owned outlets for expansion when the threat of entry from competitor firms in adjacent markets increases. The authors examine two interpretations: the convenience of quick deployment and a credible signal. Numerical analyses of a simple dynamic model of entry and franchising confirm that company-owned-outlet-based expansion arises under heightened entry threat. The simulation analysis highlights how franchising decisions in response to an elevated threat of entry may be beneficial (or harmful) for an incumbent firm, which yields key implications for firms, consumers, and policy makers.","Mitsukuni Nishida, Nathan Yang","entry accommodation, entry deterrence, franchising, organizational-form choice, retailing, threat of entry",10,,,,

Compiling a large data set of online reviews—over 280 million reviews from 25 major online platforms—the authors find that most reviews on most platforms exhibit a high degree of polarity, but the platforms vary in the degree of polarity on the basis of how selective customers are in reviewing products on the platform. Using cross-platform and multimethod analyses, including secondary data, experiments, and survey data, the authors empirically confirm polarity self-selection, described as the higher tendency of consumers with extreme evaluations to provide a review as an important driver of the polarity of review distributions. In addition, they describe and demonstrate that polarity self-selection and the polarity of the review distribution reduce the informativeness of online reviews.","Verena Schoenmueller, Oded Netzer, Florian Stahl","imbalance, online reviews, polarity, self-selection, user-generated content",13,,,
Locational Choices: Modeling Consumer Preferences for Proximity to Others in Reserved Seating Venues,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720941525,14-Aug-20,01-Oct,2020,57,5,878,899,"This article proposes a measurement approach to determine how consumers prefer to locate themselves in proximity to others during consumption experiences, such as when they purchase reserved seating tickets to a performance. Applied to data from locational choice experiments that simulate reserved seating assortments, administered to more than 2,000 participants, this approach reveals the importance of modeling proximity to others when studying locational choices. It also emphasizes the degree to which consumers are heterogeneous in their preferences for proximity to both focal elements (e.g., stage, screen, aisles) and other consumers. Therefore, event operators should collect data beyond purchase ticket logs and also include consumers who did not purchase. Furthermore, this study illustrates how managers can use fitted, individual-level parameters and an optimization model to make more effective seat-level availability decisions. In addition to these recommendations for managers of reserved seating venues, this article offers novel contributions to research related to advance selling, spatial models, and personal space.","Simon J.

Consumer Search and Filtering on Online Retail Platforms,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720928367,29-Jun-20,01-Oct,2020,57,5,900,916,"This article examines how the consumer’s search cost and filtering on a retail platform affect the platform, the third-party sellers, and the consumers. The authors show that, given the platform’s percentage referral fee, a lower search cost can either increase or decrease the platform’s profit. By contrast, if the platform optimally adjusts its referral fee, a lower search cost will increase the platform’s profit. As the consumer’s search cost decreases, if the platform’s demand elasticity increases significantly, the platform should reduce its fee, potentially resulting in an all-win outcome for the platform, the sellers, and the consumers; otherwise, a lower search cost will increase the platform’s optimal fee percentage, potentially leading to higher equilibrium retail prices. Furthermore, the availability of filtering on the platform will in expectation induce consumers to search fewer products but buy products with higher match values, and filtering can either increase or decrease equilibrium retail prices. When filtering reveals only a small amount of the products’ match-value variations, it will benefit the platform, the sellers, and the consumers. This article shows that the effects of filtering and those of a decrease in search cost are qualitatively different.","Baojun Jiang, Tianxin Zou","channel, competition, e-commerce, filtering, pricing, retail platform, search",2,,,,

A promising means to do so is to leverage the digital presence of service employees on their website. A large-scale field study and several experimental studies show that the digital presence of service employees on the firm website increases current website service quality perceptions and positively shapes memories related to employee service quality perceptions from past service encounters. Both effects indirectly increase customer loyalty and, in turn, financial performance, and are amplified by employee accessibility and a service firm’s customer orientation. The authors examine further boundary conditions for the memory process: only service employees evoke the beneficial spillover effect to employee service quality perceptions, and the spillover effect does not generalize to evaluations of product quality. Remarkably, an employee’s digital presence, although factually unrelated, augments customer perceptions of service employees’ competence and commitment and thus strengthens rather than erodes service employees’ role in customer–firm relationships.

Customization in Luxury Brands: Can Valentino Get Personal?,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720943191,31-Jul-20,01-Oct,2020,57,5,937,947,"Luxury brands have started to offer consumers the opportunity to customize their exclusive products by making certain aesthetic decisions, such as the color, fabric, or cut of their products. A robust finding in the marketing literature is that consumers place a greater value on customized than on standard products because these unique products better fit and communicate their tastes, preferences, and identity. However, the majority of focal products in these studies fall outside the luxury segment. The authors demonstrate that consumers’ customization preferences differ between mainstream and luxury brands. In the luxury segment, consumers pay a premium for the designer’s expertise and the status that it can convey. As such, the consumers’ desire for self-expression can potentially erode the product’s signaling value. Through a series of four experiments, the authors demonstrate that luxury brands can benefit from customization but they can also take customization too far. Their findings suggest that brand managers should allow consumers to make fewer design decisions for luxury versus mainstream brands to preserve the signal value created by the designer.","C.

Cutting Calories: The Preference for Lower Caloric Density Versus Smaller Quantities Among Restrained and Unrestrained Eaters,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720949163,17-Aug-20,01-Oct,2020,57,5,948,965,"The marketplace includes many attractive high-calorie indulgent food offerings. Despite their appeal, consumers may often be prompted to consider lower-calorie-package offerings instead (e.g., 100-calorie packs). The question thus arises: What predicts consumers’ preferences between different kinds of lower-calorie offerings? The authors conceptualize two different routes to lower-calorie versions of indulgent foods: a lower-caloric-density version (e.g., baked potato chips) or a smaller-portion-size version (e.g., a smaller bag of potato chips). The authors examine how such versions are differentially preferred and why, focusing on the key role of dietary restraint. The authors show that as dietary restraint increases, the preference for a lower-calorie version created via lower caloric density (vs. a smaller portion size) increases. Differential weights placed on health and fullness goals help explain differing preferences across dietary restraint (as the lower-caloric-density version is perceived as healthier and more filling, albeit less tasty, than the smaller-portion-size version). This framework offers theoretical implications for understanding two routes to cutting calories, practical implications for food marketers, and methodological implications for studying food choices.","Peggy J.

Then, through three lab experiments the authors illustrate that after consumers are exposed to consumption regulations from the government (e.g., laws that restrict consumption, warning labels designed by the Food and Drug Administration), conservatives (vs. liberals) are more likely to (1) use phones when restricted (Study 2), (2) purchase unhealthy foods (Study 3), and (3) view smoking e-cigarettes more favorably (Study 4). No such effects are observed when a nongovernment source is used, or when the message from the government is framed as a notification (vs. warning).

In this article, the authors examine a public health outcome—birth rate—associated with advertisements for erectile dysfunction (ED) drugs. Since the United States loosened regulations on direct-to-consumer television advertising for prescription drugs in 1997, ED drug makers have consistently been top spenders. By comparing advertising data with multiple birth data sets (patient-level hospital data from Massachusetts between 2001 and 2010 and micro birth certificate data from the United States between 2000 and 2004), the authors demonstrate that increased ED drug television advertising leads to a higher birth rate. Their results, which are robust with respect to different functional forms and falsification tests, show that a 1% increase in ED drug advertising contributes to an increase of .04%–.08% of total births. Their findings suggest that beyond the customer purchase decision, advertising can have important public health outcomes, with resulting implications for managerial decision making and policy formulation.","Tongil “TI” Kim, Diwas KC","advertising, birth rate, border identification, fertility, health care marketing, public policy",63,,,,

In three empirical studies, the authors (1) compare human perceptions of face and contour images along 15 dimensions commonly assessed in marketing contexts; (2) investigate the effectiveness of contour images for protecting anonymity related to identity, age, and gender; and (3) implement the CaF framework in a real-life online dating context. Results show that the CaF framework effectively resolves privacy–perception trade-off problems by preserving the information that is useful for humans to make inferences about many relevant perceptual dimensions in marketing while making it virtually impossible for humans to infer identity and very difficult to infer age and gender accurately—two critical discrimination factors.

They estimate the impact of these promotions on purchase incidence, high-risk and low-risk spend, and return share. The results show that free shipping promotions increase expenditure for high-risk products, expanding their share of the consumer’s market basket and thus increasing the overall return rate. This is validated in a field experiment. A field test and an online lab experiment analyze the mechanism linking free shipping and returns. The results suggest that the free shipping effect occurs through consumers’ perceptions that free shipping serves as a risk premium compensating them for potential returns and through positive affect generated by the promotion. A simulation shows that for the focal firm, free shipping promotions increase net sales volume, but higher product returns and lost shipping revenue render these promotions unprofitable.","Edlira Shehu, Dominik Papies, Scott A.

This article establishes a game-theoretic framework and shows that the opposite can happen: platform integration can lower the service fees in both markets, alleviating double marginalization in the primary market and benefiting the musician and consumers. Moreover, with platform integration, the presence of a small number of scalpers can counterintuitively reduce the ticket price and benefit the musicians and consumers. In addition, platform competition in the resale market may harm consumers. This article further shows that these insights apply in other markets (e.g. used goods, peer-to-peer product-sharing markets) and provides suggestive empirical support for the theoretical results.","Tianxin Zou, Baojun Jiang","antitrust, channel coordination, consumer welfare, event ticket, platform, regulation, resale, secondary market",1,,,,

The present research explores two mechanisms that manufacturers use to address this challenge: training and incentives (spiffs). The authors find that the impact of these mechanisms on distributor salespeople’s efforts (toward a manufacturer’s products) largely depends on the extent to which manufacturers also provide training and incentives to distributor sales managers. More specifically, providing greater incentives to distributor sales managers undermines the relationship between their salespeople’s training and effort but enhances the relationship between their salespeople’s incentives and effort. Furthermore, greater sales manager training enhances the impact of salespeople’s incentives on effort; however, greater salesperson training undermines the relationship between salesperson incentives and effort. Thus, this research shows that the combination of mechanisms (training and incentives) and the levels at which manufacturers provide them (distributor salespeople and sales managers) can have different implications for distributor salespeople’s efforts.","Sarah Magnotta, Brian Murtha, Goutam Challagalla","effort, incentive dilemma, incentives, legitimacy, sales managers, spiffs, training, training transfer",13,,,,

Hiding Gifts Behind the Veil of Vouchers: On the Effect of Gift Vouchers Versus Direct Gifts in Conditional Promotions,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720916753,27-Apr-20,01-Aug,2020,57,4,739,754,"To boost sales, marketers often conduct promotions that offer gifts conditional on the purchase of a focal product. Such promotions can present gifts in different formats: customers could be informed that they will receive a gift directly or that they will receive a voucher entitling them to a gift. Normatively speaking, the two formats are equivalent, as a voucher’s value is identical to that of the gift it represents. Yet this article suggests that promotion format (voucher vs. direct gift) influences consumers’ intention to purchase the focal product. Five lab experiments and one field experiment reveal that, compared with presenting a gift directly, introducing a voucher attenuates the influence of gift value on purchase decisions, decreasing purchase intentions for promotions offering high-value gifts but increasing purchase intentions for promotions offering low-value gifts. This effect occurs because vouchers break the direct association between the focal product and the gift, reducing people’s tendency to compare the gift’s value with the focal product’s value. The effect observed can be attenuated by increasing the salience of gift value.","Yu Ding, Yan Zhang","comparison tendency, conditional promotion, decoupling, free gift, purchase intention, voucher",3,,,,
Lowering the Minimum Donation Amount Increases Consumer Purchase Likelihood of Products Associated with Cause-Related Marketing Campaigns,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720916463,28-Apr-20,01-Aug,2020,57,4,755,770,"Both the total amount to be donated and the way it is communicated can influence consumer reactions to cause-related marketing (CM) campaigns. While companies often choose not to explicate any donation limit, this study argues that donation frames (e.g., minimum or maximum total donation) can enhance the likelihood of consumer purchases associated with CM campaigns. In a series of four studies, the authors find that consumers often respond more favorably to minimum-frame CM campaigns with a relatively low donation amount (e.g., at least $100,000 will be donated) than those with a high donation amount (e.g., at least $10 million will be donated) despite the superiority of the latter for the recipient cause. This effect is inverted for maximum donation frames, such that a high donation amount leads to greater consumer participation. This research also demonstrates that this effect is driven by the consumer desire to make a personal contribution to a cause, which is more likely to be observed when consumers endow it with high importance. These effects are obtained with attitudes, behavioral intentions, and actual expenditures.","Michael Tsiros, Caglar Irmak","cause-related marketing, donation, framing, minimum-maximum, personal contribution",11,,,,
The Left-Digit Bias: When and Why Are Consumers Penny Wise and Pound Foolish?,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720932532,17-Jun-20,01-Aug,2020,57,4,771,788,"Consumers’ price evaluations are influenced by the left-digit bias, wherein consumers judge the difference between $4.00 and $2.99 to be larger than that between $4.01 and $3.00, even though the numeric differences are identical.

The authors propose that the left-digit bias is stronger in stimulus-based price evaluations, wherein people see the focal price and the reference price side by side, and weaker in memory-based price evaluations, wherein people have to retrieve at least one price from memory. This is because in stimulus-based price evaluations, people tend to rely on perceptual representations of prices without rounding them. In memory-based price evaluations, they rely more on conceptual representations, which makes them more likely to round the prices. Results from six studies—five experiments and a scanner panel study—support the hypothesis that the left-digit bias is stronger in stimulus-based evaluations.

They then simulate how banning links affects consumer browsing and find that linking increases celebrity news consumption, especially among consumers who browse the least.

The authors find that, on average, participants are able to partially realize the long-term benefits from loyalty programs, though most are sensitive to price. They also find that participants’ preferences and levels of bounded rationality depend on the nature of the competitive environment, the particular state of each decision scenario, and the type of optimal action. Accordingly, the authors use an approximate dynamic programming model to incorporate boundedly rational decision making. The model classifies participants into five segments that exhibit variation in their performance and decision strategies.

The increasing availability of customer databases for parent companies containing multimedia ad exposures, sales transactions in several purchase channels, and information across multiple retailer-brands now allows for a broader examination of advertising effectiveness. In this research, the authors monitor 4,000 customers over two years, linking their exposure to three media (email, catalogs, and paid search) to their in-store and online purchases for three retailer-brands in the clothing category. They develop a Tobit model for sales response to multimedia advertising that captures within-brand and within-channel correlations and accommodates individual-level advertising response parameters.

However, competitor catalogs often positively influence focal retailer-brand sales, but only among omnichannel customers.

Applying this methodology to sales and advertising data across eight brands from three categories substantiates for the first time, and uniformly across all brands, that managers depart from optimality through adaptive experimentation, which is in line with dual control theory that suggests they do so to learn about advertising effectiveness. The adaptive experimentation finding, combined with evidence on the use of heuristic methods, suggests that budget decision making is characterized by bounded rationality. Furthermore, budgeting decisions are brand-specific, reflecting the considerations of a brand’s market position and performance.

The authors also show that impairing process simulation and high skepticism moderate the ad-type effect (Studies 4–5). Finally, they show effect reversals: if consumers focus on achieving the desired results quickly, and it is possible to do so, progression ads and the associated process simulation backfire in terms of credibility and persuasion (Studies 6–7).

This sequence of effects is particularly pronounced when consumers do not have a strong prior preference for specific alternatives in the assortment.

In response to this assumption, the authors develop a conceptual framework to explain how consumers’ internal (i.e., intrinsic) and external (i.e., extrinsic) motivations for unplanned purchases actually vary during a shopping trip. Two field studies and five online experiments provide evidence that the personality trait of buying impulsivity predicts differences in whether a shopper initially focuses on internal motivations (e.g., “because I love it”) or external motivations (e.g., “because it is on sale”) for unplanned purchases at the beginning of a shopping trip and, consistent with a mechanism of motivation balancing, that motivations for unplanned purchases change as a shopper satisfies their initial motivations. The studies also demonstrate how the level of buying impulsivity influences the effectiveness of point-of-purchase messages at stimulating unplanned purchases and consumers’ relative spending on unplanned purchases. Overall, these findings address conflicting results in previous shopping studies, advance the literature streams on consumer motivation and sequential choice, and contribute insights to enhance shopper-marketing programs.","Jacob Suher, Wayne D.

Toward a Process-Transfer Model of the Endorser Effect,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720910453,15-Apr-20,01-Jun,2020,57,3,565,581,"Previous research on the effects of celebrity endorsement has focused on the transfer of positive properties (likeableness, credibility, symbolic meanings, etc.) from the endorser to the product. Taking a different perspective, this study suggests that the way in which consumers evaluate an endorser (i.e., the cognitive process, such as applying family origin or achievement as the basis for evaluation) will carry over to the evaluation of the endorsed product (e.g., applying country of origin or performance as the criteria). Five experiments support this process-transfer account and show that it can be induced by subtle verbal/visual cues in advertisements. Because the process transfer is not inherently associated with positive/negative valence, it provides a theoretical rationale for explaining successful endorsements involving endorsers who are less favorable/credible, less of a “fit” with the product, or associated with some negative meanings, in addition to those involving positively or neutrally evaluated endorsers. The process-transfer model supplements existing models and provides a more comprehensive understanding of endorser effects. It provides marketers with a set of less stringent guidelines for selecting endorsers as well as valuable damage control tools for brands when an endorser screws up.","Vincent Chi Wong, Henry Fock, Candy K.Y.

Fear of Detection and Efficacy of Prevention: Using Construal Level to Encourage Health Behaviors,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720912443,22-Apr-20,01-Jun,2020,57,3,582,598,"This research examines the psychological processes and factors that shape illness-detection versus illness-prevention health actions. Four experiments using contexts of mental health, skin cancer, and breast cancer show that illness detection evokes fear, which undermines engagement in detection behaviors. Considering detection at low (vs. high) levels of thought reduced fear and increased health persuasion. Illness prevention is driven by self-efficacy perceptions and considering prevention at high (vs. low) levels of thought increases persuasion. In further evidence of process, trait fear moderated the detection effects, and dispositional self-efficacy moderated the prevention effects. As an intervention, framing a detection action as serving illness-prevention goals increased people’s likelihood of engaging with an online breast cancer detection tool. These findings illuminate the psychology of detection as being distinct from the psychology of prevention, identify the role of fear in the consideration of health behaviors, and show contexts in which construal levels have divergent effects on health persuasion.","Chethana Achar, Nidhi Agrawal, Meng-Hua Hsieh","construal level theory, detection health behaviors, fear, health messaging",1,,,,
Nonprofit Versus For-Profit Health Care Competition: How Service Mix Makes Nonprofit Hospitals More Profitable,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719901169,05-Mar-20,01-Apr,2020,57,2,193,210,"This article studies the intersection between the largest U.S. industry—health care—and the $1 trillion nonprofit sector. Using analytical and empirical analyses, the authors reveal the marketing strategies helping private nonprofit hospitals achieve higher output, prices, and profits than for-profit hospitals. Nonprofit hospitals, focusing on both profits and output, obtain these outcomes by expanding their service mix with high-priced premium specialty medical services (PSMS), whereas for-profit hospitals can be more profitable with higher prices for basic services. Competition increases the differences between nonprofit and for-profit hospitals in PSMS breadth, output, and prices. Nonprofit hospitals lose their competitive advantage when competing with other nonprofits; that is, presence of a for-profit competitor broadens available nonprofit PSMS. With broader service mixes, nonprofits focus more on national advertising than for-profits because PSMS (e.g., pediatric trauma, neurosurgery, heart transplants, oncology) require larger geographic markets than local basic services (e.g., laboratory, diagnostics, nursing, pharmaceutics). Exogenous, heterogeneous state regulations restricting for-profit hospital entry help econometric identification (i.e., markets prohibiting for-profits act as controls).

Multiperiod Contracting and Salesperson Effort Profiles: The Optimality of “Hockey Stick,” “Giving Up,” and “Resting on Laurels”,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719887378,11-Feb-20,01-Apr,2020,57,2,211,235,"The authors study multiperiod sales force incentive contracting in which salespeople can engage in effort gaming, a phenomenon that has extensive empirical support. Focusing on a repeated moral hazard scenario with two independent periods and a risk-neutral agent with limited liability, the authors conduct a theoretical investigation to understand which effort profiles the firm can expect under the optimal contract. The authors show that various effort profiles that may give the appearance of being suboptimal, such as postponing effort exertion (“hockey stick”) and not exerting effort after a bad or a good initial demand outcome (“giving up” and “resting on laurels,” respectively) may indeed be induced optimally by the firm. This is because, under certain conditions that depend on how severe the contracting frictions are and how effective effort exertion is in increasing demand, the firm wants to concentrate rewards on extreme demand outcomes. Doing this induces gaming and reduces expected demand but also makes motivating effort cheaper, thus saving on incentive payments. On introducing dependence between time periods, such as when the agent can transfer demands between periods, this insight continues to hold and, furthermore, “hockey stick,” “giving up,” and “resting on laurels” can be optimal for the firm even under repeated short time horizon contracting. The results imply that one must carefully consider the setting and environmental factors when making inferences about contract effectiveness from dynamic effort profiles of agents.","Kinshuk Jerath, Fei Long","sales force compensation, dynamic incentives, effort gaming, “hockey stick,” sales push out and pull in",1,,
Communicating Brands in Television Advertising,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719892576,13-Feb-20,01-Apr,2020,57,2,236,256,"Many studies have quantified the effects of TV ad spending or gross rating points on brand sales. Yet this effect is likely moderated by the different types of brand-related messages or cues (e.g., logo, brand attributes) embedded in the ads and by the ways (e.g., explicitly or implicitly) these cues are conveyed to TV audiences. The authors thus measure 17 cues often used within ads to build brand awareness (or salience) and brand image and investigate their influence on ad effectiveness. Technically, the study builds a dynamic model to quantify the effects of advertising on sales; builds a robust and interpretable (i.e., nonparametric and sparse) factor model that integrates correlated, left-censored branding cues; and then models the effects of advertising as a function of the factors identified by these cues. An analysis of 177 campaigns aired by 62 brands finds that salience cues (e.g., logo) and benefit and attribute messages moderate ad effectiveness. It also finds that explicit cues are more effective than implicit ones; nonetheless, the primary drivers of ad effectiveness are visual salience cues: the duration and frequency with which the logo and the duration with which the product are displayed. The study can thus suggest ways brand and ad agency managers can improve the effects of creative ad content on sales.","Norris I.

Drawing on fluency theory, the authors argue that high-equity brands benefit more from brand typicality but less from segment typicality than low-equity brands. Using data from the U.S. car market tracking market shares of 456 car models of 39 major brands operating in seven market segments across 13 years, the study provides empirical evidence for this conjecture and, thereby, implications for strategic product design and visual design theory.","Mark Heitmann, Jan R.

According to this theory, the magnitude of product malfunctions can have a paradoxical effect on consumption experience. In particular, the less severe a product malfunction is, the more inclined consumers are to defer the initial decision about whether to take corrective action. Subsequent opportunities for corrective action are devalued relative to previously forgone ones. This dynamic tends to trap consumers in a state of inaction, resulting in their enduring smaller malfunctions longer than larger ones. A consequence of these inaction traps is that minor product malfunctions may result in less enjoyable overall consumption experiences than more severe defects. Evidence from eight experiments and a survey provides support for this theorizing by demonstrating the inaction-trap phenomenon, examining its downstream consequences, shedding light on the psychological dynamics of inaction, and identifying boundary conditions that suggest interventions for counteracting consumers’ vulnerability to suffering disproportionately from relatively minor product malfunctions.","Neil Brigden, Gerald Häubl","consumer inaction, consumption experience, decision dynamics, enjoyment, product malfunctions",,,,,

In line with the proposed visceral nature of the effect, this effect holds even for unpleasant scents but is contingent on the scent’s ability to represent the advertised product.

In addition, expressed emotion for hedonic products has a positive impact when read by others, but this emotion backfires for utilitarian products, leading others to be less positive. The authors construct a conceptual model of these effects and show that violated expectations leading to decreased trust underlie this divergence between reviewers and readers. The effects occur in well-controlled experiments as well as computational linguistic analysis of 100,000 Amazon reviews across 500 products. Indeed, emotional reviews of utilitarian products are less likely to become popular and be displayed on the product’s front page on Amazon.

In a series of online and field experiments, the authors demonstrate that the interpretation and persuasiveness of consensus language depends on the tie strength between the communicator and the receiver of WOM. Although abundant literature highlights the advantage of strong ties (e.g., close friends, family) in influence and persuasion, the authors find that weak ties (e.g., distant friends, acquaintances) are more influential than strong ties when using consensus language. The authors theorize and demonstrate that this effect occurs because weak ties evoke perceptions of a larger and more diverse group in consensus, which signals greater validity for the issue at hand.

The authors propose discrete choice experiments to holistically measure the link between attributes and benefits, as well as between attributes and choice, resulting in data that can be analyzed with a generalized probit model. The approach contributes to mediation research by offering an alternative method of handling multiple multinomial mediators and dichotomous outcome variables. An empirical illustration of bread choices shows how consumer judgments about health and value perceptions of products mediate purchase decisions.

In this work, the authors propose a novel framework for capturing the dynamics of heterogeneity, using individual-level, latent, Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian processes. Similar to standard heterogeneity specifications, this Gaussian process dynamic heterogeneity (GPDH) specification models individual-level parameters as flexible variations around population-level trends, allowing for sharing of statistical information both across individuals and within individuals over time. This hierarchical structure provides precise individual-level insights regarding parameter dynamics. The authors show that GPDH nests existing heterogeneity specifications and that not flexibly capturing individual-level dynamics may result in biased parameter estimates. Substantively, they apply GPDH to understand preference dynamics and to model the evolution of online reviews. Across both applications, they find robust evidence of dynamic heterogeneity and illustrate GPDH’s rich managerial insights, with implications for targeting, pricing, and market structure analysis.","Ryan Dew, Asim Ansari, Yang Li","Bayesian nonparametrics, choice models, dynamics, Gaussian processes, heterogeneity, machine learning, topic models",34,,,,

This is a prevalent practice for firms and a worldwide concern for consumers. Extant research has examined BBP under the assumption that consumers observe firms’ practice of BBP. However, consumers do not know that specific firms are doing this and are often unaware of how firms collect and use their data. In this article, the authors examine (1) how firms make BBP decisions when consumers do not observe whether firms perform BBP and (2) how the transparency of firms’ BBP practice affects firms and consumers. They find that when consumers do not observe firms’ practice of BBP and the cost of implementing BBP is low, a firm indeed practices BBP, even though BBP is a dominated strategy when consumers observe it. When the cost is moderate, the firm does not use BBP; however, it must distort its first-period price downward to signal and convince consumers of its choice. A high cost of implementing BBP serves as a commitment device that the firm will forfeit BBP, thereby improving firm profit. By comparing regimes in which consumers do and do not observe a firm’s practice of BBP, the authors find that transparency of BBP increases firm profit but decreases consumer surplus and social welfare. Therefore, requiring firms to disclose collection and usage of consumer data could hurt consumers and lead to unintended consequences.","Xi Li, Krista J.

Five subsequent experiments test a process account for this effect, identifying two key psychological mechanisms: reputational benefits and action costs. First, at the referral stage, senders (existing customers) anticipate reputational benefits for referring recipients (potential new customers), who receive a reward for signing up. These reputational benefits render recipient-benefiting referrals just as effective as sender-benefiting referrals at the relatively low-cost referral stage. Second, at the uptake stage, recipient-benefiting referrals are more effective than sender-benefiting referrals: recipient-benefiting referrals directly incentivize recipients to sign up, providing a clear reward for an otherwise costly uptake decision. The preponderance of selfish, or sender-benefiting, referral incentives in the marketplace suggests these effects are unanticipated by marketers who design incentive schemes.","Rachel Gershon, Cynthia Cryder, Leslie K.

Thus, a female identity and a global (vs. local) identity, as is the case with a male identity and a local (vs. global) identity, results in identity incongruence (vs. congruence). The authors argue that identity incongruence depletes cognitive resources and induces affective processing, which in turn activates a sacrifice mindset and results in lower price sensitivity. Five studies with different research designs, divergent measures of key constructs, and diverse samples support the theories and identify boundary conditions of the focal relationship.

They find that (1) as the debates progressed, the content of the “Twittersphere” became increasingly decoupled from the live event, and (2) the drivers of the success of tweets during the debates differed from the drivers of success observed after the debates. During the debates, users acted akin to narrators, posting shorter tweets that commented on unfolding events, with linguistic emotionality playing a limited role in sharing. However, when the debates were over, users acted more like interpreters, with successful posts being more elaborate and visually and emotionally rich accounts of the event. Evidence for the generalizability of the findings is provided by an analysis of Barack Obama’s last State of the Union Address, where similar dynamics are observed.","Ron Berman, Shiri Melumad, Colman Humphrey,...","contagion, debates, information diffusion, political marketing, social media, Twitter",7,,,,
Large-Scale Cross-Category Analysis of Consumer Review Content on Sales Conversion Leveraging Deep Learning,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719866690,30-Aug-19,01-Dec,2019,56,6,918,943,"How consumers use review content has remained opaque due to the unstructured nature of text and the lack of review-reading behavior data. The authors overcome this challenge by applying deep learning–based natural language processing on data that tracks individual-level review reading, searching, and purchasing behaviors on an e-commerce site to investigate how consumers use review content. They extract quality and price content from 500,000 reviews of 600 product categories and achieve two objectives. First, the authors describe consumers’ review-content-reading behaviors. Although consumers do not read review content all the time, they do rely on it for products that are expensive or of uncertain quality. Second, the authors quantify the causal impact of read-review content on sales by using supervised deep learning to tag six theory-driven content dimensions and applying a regression discontinuity in time design. They find that aesthetics and price content significantly increase conversion across almost all product categories. Review content has a higher impact on sales when the average rating is higher, ratings variance is lower, the market is more competitive or immature, or brand information is not accessible. A counterfactual simulation suggests that reordering reviews based on content can have the same effect as a 1.6% price cut for boosting conversion.","Xiao Liu, Dokyun Lee, Kannan Srinivasan","consumer purchase journey, deep learning, economic impact of text, product reviews, natural language processing, regression discontinuity in time",,,,,
The Impact of Increasing Search Frictions on Online Shopping Behavior: Evidence from a Field Experiment,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719865516,22-Sep-19,01-Dec,2019,56,6,944,959,"Many online stores are designed such that shoppers can easily access any available discounted products. The authors propose that deliberately increasing search frictions by placing obstacles to locating discounted items can improve online retailers’ margins and even increase conversion. The authors demonstrate this using a simple theoretical framework that suggests inducing consumers to inspect higher-priced items first may simultaneously increase the average price of items sold and the overall expected purchase probability by inducing consumers to search more products. The authors test and confirm these predictions in a series of field experiments conducted with a dominant online fashion and apparel retailer. Furthermore, using information in historical transaction data about each consumer, the authors demonstrate that price-sensitive shoppers are more likely to willingly incur search costs when locating discounted items. Our results show that increasing search frictions can be used as a self-selecting price discrimination tool to match high discounts with price-sensitive consumers and full-priced offerings with price-insensitive consumers.","Donald Ngwe, Kris Johnson Ferreira, Thales Teixeira","e-commerce, friction, online retailing, price discrimination, search costs",3,,,,
When Words Sweat: Identifying Signals for Loan Default in the Text of Loan Applications,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719852959,15-Aug-19,01-Dec,2019,56,6,960,980,"The authors present empirical evidence that borrowers, consciously or not, leave traces of their intentions, circumstances, and personality traits in the text they write when applying for a loan.

The authors use text-mining and machine learning tools to automatically process and analyze the raw text in over 120,000 loan requests from Prosper, an online crowdfunding platform. Including in the predictive model the textual information in the loan significantly helps predict loan default and can have substantial financial implications. The authors find that loan requests written by defaulting borrowers are more likely to include words related to their family, mentions of God, the borrower’s financial and general hardship, pleading lenders for help, and short-term-focused words. The authors further observe that defaulting loan requests are written in a manner consistent with the writing styles of extroverts and liars.","Oded Netzer, Alain Lemaire, Michal Herzenstein","consumer finance, loan default, machine learning, text mining",3,,,,
Measuring Rank-Based Utility in Contests: The Effect of Disclosure Schemes,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719853289,25-Aug-19,01-Dec,2019,56,6,981,994,"This article studies how the incentive structures and disclosure schemes of a contest affect the contestants’ intrinsic motivations. Specifically, the authors measure the effects of these design decisions on two types of nonmonetary rank-based utility: self-generated and peer-induced. They run a set of laboratory experiments involving contests under various reward spreads and disclosure schemes. First, they find that virtually all commonly adopted disclosure schemes generate positive peer-induced rank-based utility. However, the relative performances of alternative disclosure schemes can depend on the spread of contest rewards and the number of contestants. Second, being recognized as a winner confers positive peer-induced rank-based utility; moreover, being recognized as the sole first-place winner or as one among multiple winners does not produce significantly different peer-induced utility. Third, “shaming” by disclosing the identity of contestants ranked at the bottom leads to negative peer-induced rank-based utility, but the effect is marginally insignificant. Finally, a smaller spread of contest rewards consistently results in higher levels of self-generated rank-based utility. These results underscore the importance of jointly choosing incentive structures and disclosure schemes.","Tanjim Hossain, Mengze Shi, Robert Waiser","rank-based utility, recognition, sales contests, lab experiments",,,,,
Media Coverage of Climate Change and Sustainable Product Consumption: Evidence from the Hybrid Vehicle Market,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719865898,12-Sep-19,01-Dec,2019,56,6,995,1011,"As sustainable consumption becomes increasingly important, firms must better understand the drivers behind the consumption of these products.

This impact mainly comes from the media reports that assert that climate change is occurring. In contrast, media coverage that either denies climate change or holds a neutral stance on the issue has little impact. The authors provide preliminary evidence that a social norm advocating for environmentally friendly consumption plays an important role in how media coverage affects consumer purchase.

This research introduces the concept of customer empowerment and develops and tests a model of customer empowerment as a parallel mediator, along with customer satisfaction, to explain the linkage between CP and bank branch performance. Furthermore, the authors draw on a broader set of moderators beyond customer characteristics to examine when CP affects empowerment and satisfaction. Using triadic matched data from a multiwave design and a three-level model in which customers are nested within employees, who are, in turn, nested within bank branches, the authors show that customer empowerment and satisfaction fully mediate the effect of CP on branch performance. The findings also show that CP results in greater customer empowerment and satisfaction when there is fit between participation and the context in which it is used.

Second, a series of comparisons reveal that households in harbinger zip codes make other decisions that differ from other households. The first comparison identifies harbinger zip codes using purchases from one retailer and then evaluates purchases at a different retailer. Households in harbinger zip codes purchase products from the second retailer that other households are less likely to purchase. The analysis next compares donations to congressional election candidates; households in harbinger zip codes donate to different candidates than households in neighboring zip codes, and they donate to candidates who are less likely to win. House prices in harbinger zip codes also increase at slower rates than in neighboring zip codes. Investigation of households that change zip codes indicates that the harbinger zip code effect is more due to where customers choose to live, rather than households influencing their neighbors’ tendencies.","Duncan I.

A series of large-scale field and experimental studies, conducted with Western and Eastern consumers, shows that matching the interface to consumers’ culture-specific processing style enhances the effectiveness of mass customization. Specifically, presenting the same information isolated (by attribute) to Western consumers but contextualized (by alternative) to Eastern consumers increases satisfaction with and likelihood of purchasing the configured product, along with the amount of money spent on the product. These positive consumer responses emerge because of an increase in “interface fluency”—consumers’ subjective experience of ease when using the interface.

This article explicitly models the consumer’s multipurchase behavior and examines an upstream content creator’s content production and selling strategies as well as competing downstream distributors’ content acquisition and pricing strategies. The authors find that in contrast to the case of single-product purchase, under multiproduct purchase, only one distributor will acquire the creator’s new content in equilibrium. Furthermore, when the content distributors are not highly differentiated (each having a limited amount of unique content), the content creator will reduce new content production, leading to lower profits for both the content creator and the content distributors. By contrast, when the distributors are already highly differentiated with a substantial amount of unique content, the content creator will increase its content production, leading to higher profits for both the content creator and the distributors.

Using a difference-in-differences approach, the authors show that online store sales increased, on average, by 1.45% per business-day reduction in delivery time, from a baseline of seven business days. The authors also find a positive spillover effect to the retailer’s offline stores. These effects increase gradually in the short-to-medium run as the result of higher order count. The authors identify two main drivers of the observed effect: (1) customer learning through service interactions with the retailer and (2) existing brand presence in terms of online store penetration rate and offline store presence.

When Salespeople Manage Customer Relationships: Multidimensional Incentives and Private Information,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719847661,03-Jul-19,01-Oct,2019,56,5,749,766,"At many firms, incentivized salespeople with private information about customers are responsible for customer relationship management. Although incentives motivate sales performance, private information can induce moral hazard by salespeople to gain compensation at the expense of the firm. The authors investigate the sales performance–moral hazard trade-off in response to multidimensional performance (acquisition and maintenance) incentives in the presence of private information. Using unique panel data on customer loan acquisition and repayments linked to salespeople from a microfinance bank, the authors detect evidence of salesperson private information. Acquisition incentives induce salesperson moral hazard, leading to adverse customer selection, but maintenance incentives moderate it as salespeople recognize the negative effects of acquiring low-quality customers on future payoffs. Critically, without the moderating effect of maintenance incentives, the adverse selection effect of acquisition incentives overwhelms the sales-enhancing effects, clarifying the importance of multidimensional incentives for customer relationship management. Reducing private information (through job transfers) hurts customer maintenance but has greater impact on productivity by moderating adverse selection at acquisition. This article also contributes to the recent literature on detecting and disentangling customer adverse selection and customer moral hazard (defaults) with a new identification strategy that exploits the time-varying effects of salesperson incentives.","Minkyung Kim, K.

The Charm of Behavior-Based Pricing: When Consumers’ Taste Is Diverse and the Consideration Set Is Limited,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719834945,03-Jul-19,01-Oct,2019,56,5,767,790,"Technology is making it easier for firms to track consumers’ purchase history and leverage the information when setting prices.

The analysis identifies a novel mechanism that can help firms earn more profits with BBP than without it. Prior research shows that BBP intensifies price competition for new consumers. The authors show that if consumer valuation is low, the lower price can help expand sales to consumers for whom only the second preferred product is available, and the resulting increase in revenue more than offsets the loss in revenue because of the intensified price competition. The opposite result occurs if product valuation is high. Moreover, the difference in the price charged for old and new consumers under BBP decreases with the diversity in consumers’ taste if consumer valuation is low. The result, however, is reversed if consumer valuation is high.","Wilfred Amaldoss, Chuan He","behavior-based pricing, game theory, product availability, spokes model",,,,,

However, the extent to which such information affects consumers is unknown. To address this gap, the authors use TripAdvisor data and five experiments to examine how mobile devices influence consumers’ perceptions of online reviews and their purchase intentions. They find that knowing a review was posted from a mobile device can lead consumers to have higher purchase intentions. Interestingly, this is due to a process in which consumers assume mobile reviews are more physically effortful to craft and subsequently equate this greater perceived effort with the credibility of the review.","Lauren Grewal, Andrew T.

However, they show that perceived task objectivity is malleable and that increasing a task’s perceived objectivity increases trust in and use of algorithms for that task. Consumers mistakenly believe that algorithms lack the abilities required to perform subjective tasks. Increasing algorithms’ perceived affective human-likeness is therefore effective at increasing the use of algorithms for subjective tasks. These findings are supported by the results of four online lab studies with over 1,400 participants and two online field studies with over 56,000 participants.

When “More” Seems Like Less: Differential Price Framing Increases the Choice Share of Higher-Priced Options,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719851490,11-Jul-19,01-Oct,2019,56,5,826,841,"Four experiments supported by six supplemental studies show that premium but higher-priced products (e.g., direct flights, larger-capacity data storage devices) are more popular when the additional cost is made explicit using differential price framing (DPF; e.g., “for $20 more”) rather than being left implicit, as in standard inclusive price framing (IPF; e.g., “for $60 total”). The DPF effect is driven by pricing focalism: relative to IPF, DPF creates a focus on the price difference, which, because it is smaller than the total price, leads to lower perceived expensiveness and thus greater choice share for the premium option. This price framing effect is robust to displaying the total cost of the purchase, bad deals, and easy-to-compute price differences, and it appears to be uniquely effective in pricing contexts. However, DPF effects are reduced among consumers who adopt a slow and effortful decision process. These findings have implications for research on price partitioning, the design of effective pricing strategy, the sources of expensiveness perceptions in the marketplace, and consumer welfare.","Thomas Allard, David J.

In seven studies, the authors show that the payment method for such supplementary products (multiple payments vs. a single lump sum) affects customers’ tendency to defect from the provider’s core service over time. Specifically, when customers pay for add-ons in multiple payments—provided that (1) they perceive the add-on as being bundled with the core service and (2) the payment period has an end point—they are initially less likely to defect from the service provider than when they pay in a single payment. Over time, however, as payments are made, this gap closes, such that defection intentions under the two payment methods eventually become similar. The authors propose that this phenomenon reflects “commitment projection,” wherein a decrease in customers’ commitment to the add-on product over time is projected onto their commitment to the service provider. These findings carry important managerial implications, given that many service providers offer add-on products in multiple-payment plans and that customers’ defection decisions substantially affect firms’ profitability.","Irit Nitzan, Danit Ein-Gar","commitment, customer defection, multiple payments",,,,,

Furthermore, two important moderators are identified: the positive effects of logo descriptiveness are considerably attenuated for brands that are familiar (vs. unfamiliar) to consumers and reversed (i.e., negative) for brands that market a type of product/service linked with negatively (vs. positively) valenced associations in consumers’ minds.

This is because customization leads customers to perceive the product in line with their own self-image (e.g., as an unhealthy eater), a phenomenon that the authors term “self-image-consistent product perceptions.” Essentially, customization may influence product perceptions depending on the product and individuals’ self-image; this can have downstream consequences on recommendations and social media communication. The authors test this theory for different product categories (clothing, food, and vacation packages) and attributes (fashionable, healthy, and adventurous) and demonstrate that framing customization as a simple choice or strengthening product positioning through labeling mitigates negative effects of customization.","Anne-Kathrin Klesse, Yann Cornil, Darren William Dahl,...","customization, product perceptions, product recommendations, self-image",1,,,,

Seven experimental studies reveal that consumers display compensatory responses when they interact with an HSR rather than a human employee (e.g., they favor purchasing status goods, seek social affiliation, and order and eat more food). The authors investigate the underlying process driving these effects, and they find that HSRs elicit greater consumer discomfort (i.e., eeriness and a threat to human identity), which in turn results in the enhancement of compensatory consumption. Moreover, this research identifies boundary conditions of the effects such that the compensatory responses that HSRs elicit are (1) mitigated when consumer-perceived social belongingness is high, (2) attenuated when food is perceived as more healthful, and (3) buffered when the robot is machinized (rather than anthropomorphized).","Martin Mende, Maura L.

Mortality and hubris can cause imbalance, but with the right skills and structures, these factors can be proactively managed. Inconsistency in the meanings of the person versus the brand can derive from the person’s unpredictability and social embeddedness and compromise brand value, but it may also enhance brand value by adding needed intimacy and authenticity.

Integrating cognitive linguistics, time psychology, and intertemporal choice, the authors demonstrate across five studies that when choices are displayed horizontally (vs. vertically), consumers more steeply discount future outcomes. Furthermore, this effect is serially mediated by attention to time and anticipated duration estimates. Specifically, the authors propose and demonstrate that horizontal (vs. vertical) temporal displays enhance the amount of attention devoted to considering the time delay and lead consumers to overestimate how long it will take to receive benefits. This research has important implications for consumers who want to forgo immediate gratification and for firms that need to manage consumers’ time perceptions.","Marisabel Romero, Adam W.

Harmful Effects of Mental Imagery and Customer Orientation During New Product Screening,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719827963,30-May-19,01-Aug,2019,56,4,637,651,"One of the traditional tenets of marketing is that managers considering whether to develop and launch a new product should adopt a customer orientation and consider whether the product would satisfy the needs of customers. This research discovers that adopting a customer orientation causes managers to experience undesirable cognitive effects. The authors find that when considering customers’ needs during the screening phase of the new product development process, managers often voluntarily engage in mental imagery (i.e., cognitive simulation) that biases their evaluation of a new product idea toward unrealistic optimism—even for a flawed product that would not satisfy customer needs. Furthermore, the authors find that managers who exert greater vigilance to achieve more accurate evaluations of the new product idea are especially vulnerable to the biasing effect, leading to less accurate evaluations. The authors test an analytical technique (i.e., a theory-based approach to analyzing the new product) that successfully allows a manager to adopt a customer orientation without an attendant bias toward optimism.","Eric D.

The current research addresses this gap by investigating an intervention termed the “bench program” with a field-based quasi experiment and a randomized lab experiment. In the field, the company under study told salespeople in treatment districts that a trainee would replace them at the end of the year if they failed to hit their quota and placed last in their district. Difference-in-differences analyses of matched treatment and control groups show that the bench program had an immediate and sustained impact on performance. Moreover, laggards improved their performance more than higher performers, and salespeople with larger advice networks improved their performance more than salespeople with smaller advice networks. A lab experiment compares the bench program with a program that had the same threat of firing but did not have replacements in sight. Performance in the bench program exceeded that in the firing condition, indicating that the vividness of a threat can increase its deterrent value.","Jeffrey P.

They employ a principal–agent model in which the firm tasks sales agents to mobilize the side of the platform that it monetizes (i.e., sellers). Specifically, the presence of network effects alters the agency relationship between the firm and the sales agent, requiring the platform firm to alter the compensation design, and the nature of the alteration depends on whether the network effects are direct or indirect and positive or negative. The authors first show how the agent’s compensation plan should account for different types of network effects. They then establish that when the platform firm compensates the agent solely on the basis of network mobilization on the side cultivated by the agent (sellers), as intuition would suggest, it will not fully capitalize on the advantage of positive network effects; that is, profit can be lower under stronger network effects. To overcome this limitation, the platform should link the agent’s pay to a second metric, specifically, network mobilization on the buyer side, even though the agent is not assigned to that side. This design induces a positive relation between the strength of network effects and profit. This research underlines the complexity and richness of network effects and provides managers with new insights regarding the design of sales agents’ compensation plans for platforms.","Hemant K.

Interestingly, a high-quality manufacturer can benefit from an increase in its competitor’s perceived quality (e.g., due to favorable product reviews from consumers or third-party rating agencies). In other words, a manufacturer may prefer a strong rather than a weak enemy, and the manufacturer can have an incentive to help its competitor improve product quality or remain in the market.

This prestige effect gives the commercial publication incentive to act contrary to the best interest of the students. If a ranking created with the commonly used attribute-and-aggregate methodology creates prestige, then to maximize profit the publication needs to (1) choose attribute score weights that do not match student preferences and (2) alter those attribute score weights over time, even in the absence of changes to student preferences and/or education technology. Without a prestige effect, the publication should choose attribute score weights that match student preferences.

Assessing Sensitive Consumer Behavior Using the Item Count Response Technique,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718821312,21-Mar-19,01-Jun,2019,56,3,345,360,"The authors propose a new truth-telling technique and statistical model called “item count response technique” (ICRT) to assess the prevalence and drivers of sensitive consumer behavior. Monte Carlo simulations and a large-scale application to self-reported cigarette consumption among pregnant women (n = 1,315) demonstrate the effectiveness of the procedure. The ICRT provides more valid and precise prevalence estimates and is more efficient than direct self-reports and previous item count techniques. It accomplishes this by (1) incentivizing participants to provide truthful answers, (2) accounting for procedural nonadherence and differential list functioning, and (3) obviating the need for a control group. The ICRT also facilitates the use of multivariate regression analysis to relate the prevalence of the sensitive behavior to individual-level covariates for theory testing and policy analysis. The empirical application reveals a significant downward bias in prevalence estimates when questions about cigarette consumption were asked directly to pregnant women, or when standard item count techniques were used. The authors find lower smoking prevalence among women with higher levels of education and who are further along in their pregnancy, and a much higher prevalence among unmarried respondents.","Martijn G. de Jong, Rik Pieters","item count technique, item response theory, list experiment, sensitive questions, smoking",1,,,,

The authors find that the responsiveness of seeding targets strongly declines with status difference; thus, unknown music creators (the majority) do not generally benefit at all from seeding influencers. Instead, they should gradually build their status by targeting low-status users rather than attempt to “jump” by targeting high-status ones. This research extends the seeding literature by introducing the concept of risk to dissemination dynamics in online communications, showing that unknown music creators do not seed specific status levels but rather choose a portfolio of seeding targets while solving a risk versus return trade-off.

The authors of this study test alternative ways to manage the use of such products: redesigning the timing of rewards, introducing notifications to users, and imposing time limits. A continuous-time demand model is proposed and empirically estimated with high-frequency data. The methodology is flexible enough to simultaneously explain multiple usage decisions that happen in quick succession, such as when to start and stop usage and how to respond to rewards or messages from the firm. The approach is implemented on a data set from the online gaming industry that includes usage decisions of a large sample of individuals. The authors find that improving reward schedules and imposing time limits leads to shorter usage sessions and longer product subscriptions—a win-win outcome.

The impact of retargeting decreases as the time since the consumer first visited the website increases—indeed, 33% of the effect of the first week’s advertising occurs on the first day. Furthermore, the authors find evidence of the existence of complementarities in advertising over time: the effect of advertising in week 2 of the campaign is higher when the user was assigned to a nonzero level of advertising in week 1.

Accordingly, the authors develop a manufacturer-level competition model to study the distribution and price decisions of insecticide manufacturers competing across multiple product forms and retail channels. Their study shows that both consumer preferences and estimated production and distribution costs vary across brands, product forms, and retail channels; that ignoring distribution and solely focusing on price competition results in up to a 55% overestimation of manufacturer profit margins; and that observed pricing and distribution patterns support competition rather than collusion among manufacturers. Through counterfactual studies, the authors find that manufacturers respond to decreases in distribution costs and to the exclusive distribution of more preferred manufacturers by asymmetrically changing their price and distribution decisions across different retail channels.","Amalesh Sharma, V.

They find that projects collect funding faster right before (vs. right after) meeting their funding goals because consumers not only are more likely to fund projects but also contribute greater amounts of money prior to goal attainment. This effect is amplified when the nature of a project tends to evoke consumers’ prosocial motivation and when a project’s creator is a single person.

This failure to follow through induces an opportunity cost. In contrast to prior research findings that opportunity costs tend to be underestimated, the authors propose that in situations where the need to choose arises from external rather than internal constraints, opportunity costs may actually be overestimated. Consumers view choice constraints as external when the necessity to trade off one option for another relates to extraneous resource limitations (e.g., whenever time, budget, or space constraints necessitate choosing between two desirable offers). Conversely, consumers perceive choice constraints as internal when that trade-off is “built-in” (e.g., when a marketing incentive requires choosing between two desirable offers). Five studies demonstrate that choosing on the basis of an external constraint induces consumers to imagine ways in which they can utilize all of the competing options in the choice set. Consequently, consumers feel that by failing to utilize their chosen option, they simultaneously miss out on all options (although in actuality they could have realized only one of those options). Consistent with this conceptualization, only consumers who want to use all of the choice set options simultaneously demonstrate opportunity cost overestimation.","Liad Weiss, Ran Kivetz","opportunity cost, perceived loss, judgment and decision making, decision bias",9,,,,

The present research helps fill this void by uncovering the novel impact of sleepiness on consumer variety-seeking behavior. The studies, using various methods and all involving consequential choices, revealed that sleepier consumers tended to seek more variety. The driver of this effect was found to be a need for arousal to maintain wakefulness. The authors also show that variety-seeking behavior is effective in partially reducing sleepiness.

The author therefore presents a set of flexible Bayesian nonparametric (NP) dynamic models that treat error densities as unknown but assume that they emerge from Dirichlet process mixtures. Although the methods address misspecification in dynamic linear models, the main innovation is a particle filter algorithm for nonlinear state-space models. The author used two advertising studies to confirm the benefits of the methods when strict error assumptions are untenable. In both studies, NP models markedly outperformed benchmarks in terms of fit and forecast results. In the first study, the benchmarks understated the effects of competitive advertising on own brand awareness. In the second study, the benchmark inflated ad quality, and consequently, the effects of past advertising appeared 36% higher than that predicted by the NP model. In general, these methods should be valuable wherever state-space models appear (e.g., brand and advertising dynamics, diffusion of innovation, dynamic discrete choice).",Norris I.

For this reason, the literature finds that PMGs can only signal low prices when firm heterogeneity is sufficiently large. Because PMGs are offered by retailers that purchase the same product from the same producer, large firm heterogeneity may be a strong assumption.

The effects on total sales are heterogeneous, ranging from net decreases to insignificant drops, motivating a targeting exercise comparing strategies that optimize promoted product sales versus total sales. Targeting for promoted product sales tends to assign promotions to customers who purchased similar products, whereas targeting for total sales assigns promotions on the basis of other user characteristics. Targeting for promoted product sales generated incremental total sales that amounted to approximately 29% of the optimal incremental total sales when targeting for total sales (an opportunity cost of 71%).

They demonstrate that the PLRM predicts persistence and licensing where existing constructs and measures do not, showing that consumers’ responses to subgoal success represent a unique dimension of self-regulation. In Studies 6–10, the authors demonstrate that the PLRM moderates the effect of subgoal success on persistence and licensing behavior, revealing that the same subgoal success situation can lead to systematically different behaviors. The authors also examine how marketing interventions can be used to increase consumers’ persistence following subgoal success. This work furthers the understanding of the determinants of persistence and licensing, improves prediction of behavior, and offers marketers tools to segment and target consumers, increasing persistence in key goal domains.","Yael Zemack-Rugar, Canan Corus, David Brinberg","motivation, goals, persistence, individual differences, measure development, self-regulation",9
Frugality Is Hard to Afford,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718821660,03-Jan-19,01-Feb,2019,56,1,1,17,"Intertemporal savings strategies, such as bulk buying or accelerating purchase timing to take advantage of a good deal, provide long-term savings in exchange for an increase in immediate spending. Although households with limited financial resources stand to benefit the most from these strategies, they are less likely to make use of them. The authors provide causal evidence that liquidity constraints impede low-income households’ ability to use these strategies, above and beyond the impact of other constraints. Exploiting recurring variation in household liquidity, this study shows that when low-income households have more liquidity, they partially catch up to higher-income households’ ability to use intertemporal savings strategies. The findings provide guidance to marketing managers and researchers regarding targeted promotional design and measurement of deal-proneness. For policy makers, they suggest a new path for decreasing the higher prices low-income households have been documented to pay for everyday goods. Policies have traditionally focused on increasing financial literacy or access to supermarkets. Our work suggests that providing greater liquidity can help low-income households make better use of savings opportunities already available to them.","A.

Extracting Features of Entertainment Products: A Guided Latent Dirichlet Allocation Approach Informed by the Psychology of Media Consumption,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718820559,31-Dec-18,01-Feb,2019,56,1,18,36,"The authors propose a quantitative approach for describing entertainment products, in a way that allows for improving the predictive performance of consumer choice models for these products. Their approach is based on the media psychology literature, which suggests that people’s consumption of entertainment products is influenced by the psychological themes featured in these products. They classify psychological themes on the basis of the “character strengths” taxonomy from the positive psychology literature (Peterson and Seligman 2004). They develop a natural language processing tool, guided latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), that automatically extracts a set of features of entertainment products from their descriptions. Guided LDA is flexible enough to allow features to be informed by psychological themes while allowing other relevant dimensions to emerge. The authors apply this tool to movies and show that guided LDA features help better predict movie-watching behavior at the individual level. They find this result with both award-winning movies and blockbuster movies. They illustrate the potential of the proposed approach in pure content-based predictive models of consumer behavior, as well as in hybrid predictive models that combine content-based models with collaborative filtering. They also show that guided LDA can improve the performance of models that predict aggregate outcomes.","Olivier Toubia, Garud Iyengar, Renée Bunnell,...","topic models, natural language processing, entertainment industry, positive psychology, media psychology",15,,,,
Capital Market Returns to New Product Development Success: Informational Effects on Product Market Advertising,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718820560,27-Dec-18,01-Feb,2019,56,1,37,56,"The authors aim to answer the following question: If the capital market reacts with abnormal stock returns to new product development success events, do these returns influence subsequent marketing decisions? Drawing on informational market feedback and managerial learning theories, the authors posit that when firms are uncertain about how responsive the product market will be to their marketing activities, signals received from the capital market help them update their beliefs about the product market’s responsiveness. In the pharmaceutical context, the authors decompose the abnormal returns at a new drug approval event into components that the firm can and cannot predict (i.e., predicted and unpredicted abnormal returns) and find that the postapproval advertising budget is larger when unpredicted abnormal approval returns are higher. Furthermore, this tendency is more pronounced for spending on detailing than for direct-to-consumer advertising. Consistent with these higher budgets, the authors find that postlaunch advertising is more effective when unpredicted abnormal approval returns are higher, particularly for detailing spending (vs. direct-to-consumer advertising). Overall, this study suggests that information flows from the capital market’s initial perceptions at new product introduction play an important role in subsequent marketing decisions in the product market.","Kyung M.

A key concern for advertisers is not only whether some consumers display degrees of “wearout” but also whether they can surpass a point at which additional exposures have a negative marginal effect: “weariness.” The authors examine a large-scale advertising campaign aimed at driving viewers to a target website, which comprises more than 12,000 users across over 400 websites. These data are analyzed using a flexible discrete mixture specification that accommodates different response shapes over ad stock and timing and parcels ad viewers into response classes based on their internet usage metrics. The resulting classes display varying degrees of wearout, with one subgroup, accounting for about 24% of the sample, evincing weariness. The model also estimates differential publisher effectiveness, with the most effective publisher being nine times more effective than the one 26 places down. The authors demonstrate that the finding of weariness is robust to all the model’s main components, with one key exception: heterogeneity in users’ ad response. Analysis further suggests that an appropriate “profiling and capping” strategy can improve ad deployment by as much as 15% overall for these data.","Inyoung Chae, Hernán A. Bruno, Fred M.

In particular, they investigate effects from whether an app emphasizes features related to peer-to-peer interactions about the brand, personal-oriented interactions between a customer and the brand, or the purchase phase itself.

As such, consumers tend to perceive asymmetrical logos as more congruent with brands that have an exciting personality. This can boost consumers’ evaluations and the market’s financial valuations of such brands, a phenomenon referred to as the “visual asymmetry effect.” The studies also show that this interplay between brand personality and logo design occurs only for the personality of excitement and the visual property of asymmetry.

A personal control threat changes consumers’ preferences as a function of whether the numerical information appears as a point value or a range (Studies 3–4). This heightened focus on format may lessen the impact of a product benefit’s predicted magnitude, if a lower magnitude is specified in a more precise format (Study 5).

This research examines the effects of food-related ambient scents on children’s and adults’ food purchases/choices. The results of a series of experiments, including field studies at a supermarket and at a middle school cafeteria, show that extended exposure (of more than two minutes) to an indulgent food–related ambient scent (e.g., cookie scent) leads to lower purchases of unhealthy foods compared with no ambient scent or a nonindulgent food–related ambient scent (e.g., strawberry scent). The effects seem to be driven by cross-modal sensory compensation, whereby prolonged exposure to an indulgent/rewarding food scent induces pleasure in the reward circuitry, which in turn diminishes the desire for actual consumption of indulgent foods. Notably, the effects reverse with brief (<30 seconds) exposure to the scent. Whereas prior research has examined cross-modal effects, this research adopts the novel approach of examining cross-modal sensory compensation effects, whereby stimuli in one sensory modality (olfactory) can compensate/satisfy the desire related to another sensory modality (gustatory).","Dipayan Biswas, Courtney Szocs","ambient scent, cross-modal sensory compensation effects, (un)healthy food choices, retail and service setting atmospherics, sensory marketing",543,,,,

In this article, the authors propose a different strategy for responding to dissimilar users, upgrading to a brand’s more exclusive products. Results from six studies show that upgrading is a preferred strategy for consumers with strong self–brand connections, who are unlikely to avoid or abandon the brand because their self-identity is tied to the brand. Among these consumers, the act of upgrading to a brand’s more exclusive products is driven by their feelings of self-threat when exposed to dissimilar users, which triggers a desire to attain a higher-status position among brand users that is fulfilled by upgrading. The authors also identify moderators of the upgrading effect for consumers with strong self–brand connections. These consumers’ increased interest in upgrading is dampened when a brand’s exclusive products are made more readily available and when a brand has already conferred higher status to them through a customer status tier program.","Yajin Wang, Deborah Roedder John","brand management, brands, status, self–brand connections",8,,

Using automobile sales data from China and a discrete choice model for differentiated products, the authors relate brand name types to demand, with evidence showing that Chinese consumers preferred vehicle models with semantic brand names (7.64% more sales than alphanumeric) but exhibited the least preference for phonosemantic names (4.92% lower sales than alphanumeric). Domestic Chinese firms benefited from semantic brand names, whereas foreign firms gained from using foreign-sounding brand names. Entry-level products performed better with semantic brand names, and high-end products excelled when they had foreign-sounding brand names. Thus, the four-way categorization of brand name types should help multinational firms and domestic Chinese firms understand and leverage the association between brand name types and consumer demand.","Fang Wu, Qi Sun, Rajdeep Grewal,...","automobile market, brand name types, Chinese consumers, consumer demand, linguistics",11,,,,

Consistent with the bounded rationality literature, we find that as Prob increases from 0 to 1, consumers process the choice-relevant information more carefully and more comprehensively. Consistent with the psychological distance literature, we find that as Prob increases from 0 to 1, consumers become less novelty seeking and more price sensitive. These findings underscore that even with incentive alignment, preference measurement choice experiments such as choice-based conjoint analyses only represent an approximation of real-life choices. Although it is not feasible to systematically use questions with high Prob in the field, we predict and find that placing a higher probability question (such as an external validity task) at the beginning rather than the end of a questionnaire has a carryover effect on attention and information processing throughout the questionnaire, and it influences preference estimates as well.","Liu (Cathy) Yang, Olivier Toubia, Martijn G. de Jong","incentive alignment, choice experiments, preference measurement, eye tracking",8,,

To Bargain or Not to Bargain: The Role of Fixed Costs in Price Negotiations,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718818451,18-Dec-18,01-Dec,2018,55,6,832,851,"Retailers routinely allow consumers to negotiate a discount off the posted price for big-ticket items such as home appliances and automobiles, and on online platforms such as Amazon and eBay. The profitability of such a strategy, relative to selling only at posted prices, depends on consumers’ willingness to initiate a negotiation and ability to negotiate a discount. In this article, the authors incorporate consumers’ decision of whether to negotiate into a demand model. The decision to negotiate hinges on how the expected discount from negotiation compares with the magnitude of a nonpecuniary cost that the consumer incurs by initiating the negotiation. The current study shows how this cost can be nonparametrically identified, separately from consumers’ ability to get a discount and marginal utility of income. The application of this model to individual-level data on refrigerator transactions reveals that, conditional on negotiating, consumers get, on average, 41% of the available surplus and incur an average cost of $28 to initiate a negotiation. The magnitude of these nonpecuniary costs’ not only affects retailer profits but also has implications for pricing strategy and consumer surplus. Ignoring these costs results in biased estimates of consumers’ willingness to pay, translating to annual losses of $1.6 million in the current study setting.","Pranav Jindal, Peter Newberry","bargaining, bargaining costs, fixed pricing, Nash equilibrium, price discrimination",6,,,,

Additionally, they find that consumers are significantly more likely to accept pseudo-free offers (with nonmonetary costs) than comparable nonfree offers (with monetary costs). The authors provide evidence that consumers respond to pseudo-free offers in this way because, in general, consumers generate neutral or positive attributions for why firms make these offers, and these attributions, in turn, lead consumers to perceive the pseudo-free offers as fair. However, when contextual influences, characteristics of the pseudo-free offer, or individual dispositions increase the likelihood of negative attributions, consumers’ preference for pseudo-free offers is attenuated.","Steven K.

Specifically, in six studies, the authors find that, in sequential choice settings, individuals exhibit significant positive state dependence in risk-taking preferences, such that they are more likely to take a risk when it is similar to a previously taken risk than when it is dissimilar. For example, if an individual has previously taken a health/safety risk, that individual is more likely to take a second health/safety risk than a second risk that is in the financial domain. The authors show that because similarity between risks is malleable and can be determined by situational and contextual variables, subsequent risk-taking intentions can be changed in a predictable manner when similarity is manipulated through framing. The authors establish that increased feelings of self-efficacy and self-signaling through the prior risk-taking experience drive state-dependent risk-taking preferences. The authors further show that the effect of similarity on preferences is not moderated by the outcome received in the prior risk and holds when controlling for individual-level and domain-specific heterogeneity. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the similarity structures that exist between risks have a significant effect on risk-taking preferences in dynamic choice settings.","Elizabeth C.

In line with egocentric categorization theory, which identifies the self as a dominant reference category in product judgment, the authors demonstrate cognitive drivers of the effect. Specifically, egocentric improvement evaluations are moderated by self-focus, which determines whether the self is an accessible reference category. Furthermore, the authors propose that egocentric improvement evaluations also have a motivational driver: consumers project their self-improvement onto self-connected brands to satisfy self-enhancement motives.

While much progress has been made in building a well-validated customer-based valuation model for contractual (or subscription-based) firms, there has been little progress for noncontractual firms. Noncontractual businesses have more complex transactional patterns because customer churn is not observed, and customer purchase timing and spend amounts are more irregular. Furthermore, publicly disclosed data are aggregated over time and across customers, are often censored, and may vary from firm to firm, making it harder to estimate models for customer acquisition, ordering, and spend per order.

Theory has suggested that much of the value of chain affiliation to firms comes from the ability of chain partners to use the same name, imagery, logo, and marketing to create a common brand reputation and signal specific qualities in settings with asymmetric information between buyers and sellers. As more information becomes available, consumers should rely less on branding for quality signals, and firms’ ability to extend reputations across heterogeneous outlets should decrease. To examine this empirically, the author combines a large panel of hotel revenues with millions of online reviews from multiple platforms. Chain-affiliated hotels earn substantially higher revenues than equivalent independent hotels, but this premium has declined by over 50% from 2000 to 2015. This can be largely attributed to an increase in online reputation mechanisms, and this effect is largest for low-quality and small-market firms. Measures of the information content of online reviews show that as information has increased, independent hotel revenue has grown substantially more than chain hotel revenue. This result should be viewed as descriptive, with attempts to come to near causality including the use of machine learning to derive latent dimensions of firm quality from the text of online reviews. Finally, the correlation between firm revenue and chain-wide reputation is decreasing, whereas the correlation with individual hotel reputation is increasing.",Brett Hollenbeck,"Branding, online reviews, online platforms, franchising, machine learning",10,,,,
How Evaluations of Multiple Percentage Price Changes Are Influenced by Presentation Mode and Percentage Ordering: The Role of Anchoring and Surprise,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718808554,16-Oct-18,01-Oct,2018,55,5,655,666,"To advance theory, this study details how consumers evaluate multiple percentage price changes (discounts or surcharges). If they consider two discounts—for example, take 18% off the list price, then take an additional 12% off—consumers weight the two percentages to make their evaluations. Cues endogenous to the communication of those percentages also influence the weights applied, according to whether the two percentages appear presented at the same time (simultaneously) or temporally separated (sequentially) and whether the first percentage is larger or smaller. Depending on both the presentation mode and the ordering, consumers use different processes. In addition to providing practical guidance, this article extends understanding of anchoring and adjustment processes; information presented simultaneously leads consumers to anchor on the first piece of information. Sequential presentation instead induces surprise and shifts attention to the latter percentage change, which serves as the anchor in subsequent judgments.

Delusion in Attribution: Caveats in Using Attribution for Multimedia Budget Allocation,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718802845,01-Nov-18,01-Oct,2018,55,5,667,685,"Media attribution is the assignment of a percentage weight to each media touchpoint a consumer is exposed to prior to purchasing. Many firms consider using attribution to allocate media budgets, particularly for digital media, but an important question is whether this is appropriate. An initial hurdle when answering this question is that, despite the surge in interest for media attribution in marketing academia and practice, attribution does not have an agreed-on formal definition. Therefore, this article proposes an attribution formulation based on the relative incremental contribution that each medium makes to a purchase, taking into account advertising carryover and interaction effects. The formulation shows that attribution is proportional to the marginal effectiveness of a medium times its number of exposures. This means that often-used media will have high attribution weights. However, the profit-maximizing allocation for a fixed budget is a function of advertising effectiveness, but not a function of past exposure levels. By offering analytical derivations and studying simulated and empirical data, the paper shows how attribution can offer misleading insights on how to allocate resources across media. Moreover, the empirical example demonstrates that substantial gains in purchase probability can be made using profit-maximizing allocation compared with attribution-based allocation.","Peter J.

When Does Partitioned Pricing Lead to More Favorable Consumer Preferences?: Meta-Analytic Evidence,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718800724,11-Oct-18,01-Oct,2018,55,5,686,703,"Evidence of the impact of partitioned pricing is contradictory. Research indicates that partitioning a price into multiple components can result in more favorable preferences, due to a lower recalled price, or less favorable preferences, due to unfavorable surcharge evaluations. To explain these divergent effects, the authors examine the role of price presentation moderators, which reflect how managers convey prices to consumers (e.g., Is the total price present or absent?), magnitude moderators, which reflect the actual prices charged (e.g., What is the surcharge magnitude?), and contextual moderators, which reflect nonprice transaction characteristics (e.g., Is the product category hedonic or utilitarian?). A meta-analysis of 17 years of partitioned pricing research examining 149 observations in 27 papers (N = 12,878) suggests that consumers respond more favorably to partitioned pricing than to all-inclusive pricing when the total price is absent, as the price level increases, when the surcharges are typical for the product category, when the surcharges are perceived as offering high benefit, and when the product category is utilitarian.","Ajay T.

Does Selective Sales Force Training Work?,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718803096,12-Oct-18,01-Oct,2018,55,5,722,737,"Companies spend billions of dollars annually on sales force training, often carried out as off-site, multiday training events. However, the numerous challenges involved in training an entire sales group force many retailers to selectively train only a subset of their salespeople. It is crucial to know when selective training can be more effective and what composition of salespeople should be trained to benefit the entire group. This study addresses these questions using data from several stores of a retailer with different sales force training policies (full, selective, and no training [control]). The authors track the degree to which salespeople applied a customer relationship—building strategy taught in the training, along with more than 30 store- and salesperson-level covariates, and perform various analyses to correct for selection issues. They find that (1) selective training can be highly effective in stores with low performance diversity, (2) training salespeople with diverse tenures helps the spillover of training to the untrained, and (3) untrained salespeople with performance that is similar to the trained group are more likely to adopt the training-related behavior.","Yashar Atefi, Michael Ahearne, James G.

Intercompetitor Licensing and Product Innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718802846,17-Oct-18,01-Oct,2018,55,5,738,751,"This article explores how intercompetitor licensing between an incumbent and an entrant affects market competition and the entrant’s optimal product quality. In the model, the incumbent has a noncore technology that is used for the noncore attribute of the final product, and the entrant has a new core technology to introduce a new, higher-quality product. For the noncore technology of its product, the entrant can either license it from the incumbent or develop it in-house. The authors show that a royalty licensing contract of the noncore technology between the incumbent and the entrant has a competition-alleviating effect. More important, the effect of such licensing on the entrant’s optimal quality depends on whether its core technology can significantly or only incrementally increase its product quality over the incumbent’s product quality. The royalty contract will tend to increase the entrant’s optimal quality when the entrant’s core technology can offer a significant quality improvement over the incumbent’s. By contrast, if the entrant’s technology can raise its product quality only incrementally over the incumbent’s product quality, the royalty contract will tend to reduce the entrant’s optimal quality. A wide range of royalty licensing contracts are mutually acceptable; the incumbent (entrant) can benefit from such a contract even when the entrant pays a total royalty fee that is lower (higher) than its alternative research-and-development cost. These results hold even when the incumbent endogenously chooses its royalty licensing fee. The main results are robust to several alternative modeling assumptions (e.g., alternative game sequence, endogenous quality decision by the incumbent, alternative licensing contract).","Baojun Jiang, Hongyan Shi","competition, intercompetitor licensing, pricing, product quality, royalty",6,,,,
The Seesaw Self: Possessions, Identity (De)activation, and Task Performance,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718793885,04-Oct-18,01-Oct,2018,55,5,752,765,"Research has shown that possessions have the power to change consumers’ self-construal and activate different aspects of the self. Building on this literature, the authors suggest that the salience of product ownership not only activates the product-related self but also simultaneously deactivates product-unrelated selves, resulting in impaired performance on tasks unrelated to the activated self. In five experiments, we first elicit feelings of ownership over a product (e.g., a calculator) to activate a product-related identity (e.g., the math self). Participants then engage in a task that is labeled as being a product-related task (e.g., a math task) or a product-unrelated task (e.g., a visual task). Although the task is the same, participants in the ownership condition perform worse on a task labeled as product-unrelated than those in the baseline condition do. Support for the underlying identity activation process comes from the finding that performance impairment is more likely to hold under conditions of low self-concept clarity, in which identity is malleable.

When Showrooming Increases Retailer Profit,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.17.0059,01-Aug-18,01-Aug,2018,55,4,459,473,"Showrooming, the phenomenon of consumers visiting a brick-and-mortar (B&M) store to learn about products but then buying online to obtain lower prices, is attracting increased attention both in business practice and in academic literature. It is considered a major threat to the B&M retailers, and determining “how to fight it” seems to be the only consideration. However, the manufacturer's need for retail informational services has always been one of the essential reasons for retailers to exist and is a means for retailers to achieve profitability. The popular arguments about the threat of showrooming ignore the strategic role of the manufacturer in the distribution channel. This article analytically shows that when the manufacturer's decisions are considered (i.e., when the manufacturer–retailer contract is endogenous), consumers’ ability to engage in showrooming may lead to increased, rather than decreased, profitability for B&M retailer(s). Thus, retail efforts to restrict showrooming behavior may be misguided. This result holds even if the manufacturer is restricted to wholesale-only contracts and is not allowed to price discriminate between channels.","Dmitri Kuksov, Chenxi Liao","showrooming, free riding, service, retail competition, channel coordination, game theory",,,,,

Efficient Large-Scale Internet Media Selection Optimization for Online Display Advertising,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0307,01-Aug-18,01-Aug,2018,55,4,489,506,"In today's digital market, the number of websites available for advertising has ballooned into the millions. Consequently, firms often turn to ad agencies and demand-side platforms (DSPs) to decide how to allocate their Internet display advertising budgets. Nevertheless, most extant DSP algorithms are rule-based and strictly proprietary. This article is among the first efforts in marketing to develop a nonproprietary algorithm for optimal budget allocation of Internet display ads within the context of programmatic advertising. Unlike many DSP algorithms that treat each ad impression independently, this method explicitly accounts for viewership correlations across websites. Consequently, campaign managers can make optimal bidding decisions over the entire set of advertising opportunities. More Importantly, they can avoid overbidding for impressions from high-cost publishers, unless such sites reach an otherwise unreachable audience. The proposed method can also be used as a budget-setting tool, because it readily provides optimal bidding guidelines for a range of campaign budgets. Finally, this method can accommodate several practical considerations including consumer targeting, target frequency of ad exposure, and mandatory media coverage to matched content websites.","Courtney Paulson, Lan Luo, Gareth M.

The authors develop hypotheses pertaining to the main effects of the three agglomeration types on eWOM volume, which take the form of an inverted U-shape, and the moderating effect of vertical quality differentiation.

Modeling Gift Choice: The Effect of Uncertainty on Price Sensitivity,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.16.0453,01-Aug-18,01-Aug,2018,55,4,524,540,"Gift giving generates high revenues for retailers. It is also marked with significant welfare, or deadweight, loss in that givers tend to pay more than the receivers’ valuation. Previous research has attributed this discrepancy to givers’ inaccurate predictions of the receivers’ preferences. This research demonstrates that reduced price sensitivity is another important source of the deadweight loss: givers use gift prices to signal the importance of their relationship with the receiver. In order to demonstrate this mechanism, the authors develop a new Bayesian gift-choice model that captures both preference predictions as well as the signaling value of price. The model is estimated on two choice-based conjoint studies for gift giving that allow for the manipulation of the giver's uncertainty about the receiver's preferences. Both studies show the strong signaling value of price, especially when givers are uncertain about receivers’ preferences. Decomposition of the deadweight loss shows that the signaling value of price is an important source of welfare loss, especially in markets with heterogeneous prices. These findings have key implications for the gift industry.","Sherry Shi Wang, Ralf Van Der Lans","gift giving, choice models, deadweight loss, price sensitivity, preference predictions",8,,,,
(I'm) Happy to Help (You): The Impact of Personal Pronoun Use in Customer–Firm Interactions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.16.0118,01-Aug-18,01-Aug,2018,55,4,541,555,"In responding to customer questions or complaints, should marketing agents linguistically “put the customer first” by using certain personal pronouns?

The authors find evidence of this language pattern in use at over 40 firms. However, they theorize and demonstrate that these personal pronoun emphases are often suboptimal. Five studies using lab experiments and field data reveal that firm agents who refer to themselves using “I” rather than “we” pronouns increase customers’ perceptions that the agent feels and acts on their behalf. In turn, these positive perceptions of empathy and agency lead to increased customer satisfaction, purchase intentions, and purchase behavior. Furthermore, the authors find that customer-referencing “you” pronouns have little impact on these outcomes and can sometimes have negative consequences.

The authors further show that teasing is hedonically beneficial because uncertainty engenders curiosity and thereby builds a potential for a positive experience, whereas uncertainty resolution satisfies the curiosity and thereby realizes that potential.

Using data on content sharing from two directed social media platforms (Twitter and Digg), the authors establish that a receiver is more likely to share content from a sender with whom they share more common followees, common followers, or common mutual followers even after accounting for other measures. In addition, common followers have a higher effect than common mutual followers on the sharing propensity of the receiver. Finally, the effect of common followers and common mutual followers is positive when the content is novel but decreases, and may even become negative, when many others have already shared it.

Moreover, network effects typically encourage matchmakers to retain the users in the market to create positive externalities, which can result in less precise matchmaking. In addition, consumer patience prompts competing matchmakers to implement ineffective technology.

Because of data limitations, minimal empirical work has directly addressed this issue. In Hong Kong, however, prices vary both within and across multiplexes. Using daily ticket prices and attendance by theater and movie, the authors empirically examine the potential gains from differentiated movie-specific pricing as well as the increasingly common two-tier (2D/3D) uniform pricing, as compared with a full uniform pricing strategy in which a theater charges the same price for all its movies. Their results show that differential pricing leads to higher profits than the two-tier uniform pricing practice, but that the improvement is limited. In contrast, the gains are substantial when compared with the full uniform pricing strategy, suggesting that only minimal differentiation (2D/3D) may obtain most of the gains available from fully differentiated prices.","Jason Y.C.

The Impact of Death-Related Media Information on Consumer Value Orientation and Scope Sensitivity,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.16.0282,01-Jun-18,01-Jun,2018,55,3,432,445,"This research examines how incidental exposure to death-related information in the media affects consumers’ value orientation and scope sensitivity to marketing stimuli. Five studies demonstrate that, in contrast to thoughts about one's own mortality, exposure to death-related information in the media can shift consumers’ focus from extrinsic to intrinsic values. This leads them to pay less attention to the marketing stimuli, which are generally associated with extrinsic values, and consequently results in lower sensitivity to the magnitude of products and services. These effects are reversed when the marketing stimuli are associated with intrinsic values. Moreover, we found that exposure to death-related media information will generate effects similar to those of mortality salience when the information is perceived to be self-relevant and thus could induce death anxiety. The authors discuss implications and possible extensions.","Zhongqiang (Tak) Huang, Xun (Irene) Huang, Yuwei Jiang","death-related media information, death awareness, value orientation, scope sensitivity, self-relevance",,,,,
When Promoting Similarity Slows Satiation: The Relationship of Variety, Categorization, Similarity, and Satiation,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0010,01-Jun-18,01-Jun,2018,55,3,446,457,"Satiation is an ongoing marketing challenge as it continually reduces a consumer's ability to enjoy a favored experience. The prevailing notion is that satiation increases with similarity; hence, consumers can best slow satiation by consuming stimuli that are as different as possible. We challenge this traditional (and intuitive) view and instead propose that stimuli can be so inherently different that consumers no longer spontaneously consider them together as part of the same experience. In such cases, promoting the similarity of the stimuli can counterintuitively slow satiation. We propose that this reversal happens because finding similarities leads the consumer to place these episodes into a single ad hoc category for the ongoing experience, thereby helping the consumer fully realize the overall variety inherent across all stimuli. Five studies establish this finding across multiple domains (music, art, and food) and provide process evidence that an ad hoc categorization for the overall experience underlies our effect. Our theory and findings provide insight into how and when similarity can help or hinder satiation, and they clarify the role of ad hoc categorization in this relationship.","Jannine D.

When and how Managers' Responses to Online Reviews Affect Subsequent Reviews,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0511,01-Apr-18,01-Apr,2018,55,2,163,177,"In this study, the authors investigate the externalities of managers' responses (MRs) to online reviews on popular travel websites. Specifically, the authors examine the effect of publicly responding to hotel guests' reviews on subsequent reviewer ratings. The authors find that manager responses to negative reviews (MR-N) can significantly influence subsequent opinion in a positive way if those responses are observable at the time of reviewing. Notably, the findings show this externality to be negative for manager responses to positive reviews (MR-P). The authors conduct a topic analysis on review texts and corresponding MRs to study the moderating role of response tailoring on the opinion externalities of MR. The authors show that tailored MR amplifies the positive (negative) impact of MR-N (MR-P) on subsequent opinion. Intuitively, tailoring an MR-N adds specificity to the hotel's complaint management strategy, bolstering the positive effects of MR-N on subsequent opinion. However, by highlighting specific positive elements of a review, managers' intent for responding is brought into question as they take advantage of reviewers' positive feedback to promote their hotel.","Yang Wang, Alexander Chaudhry","online reviews, manager response, causal inference, topic analysis",14,,,,

The authors test hypotheses with data from video recordings of real-life problem-solving interactions involving airline customers as well as a controlled experimental study. They find that frontline solving work has a positive effect on CSAT, and it increases in magnitude as the interaction unfolds. However, this positive effect becomes weaker for relatively higher levels of frontline relational work or displayed affect and, conversely, stronger for relatively lower levels over time. In summary, overdoing relational work and overdisplaying positive affect diminish the efficacy of problem-solving interactions, a finding that provides implications for theory and practice.","Detelina Marinova, Sunil K.

The empirical analysis uses a combination of households' longitudinal grocery purchase information, rich survey data, and detailed item-level nutrition information. After accounting for selection on observables and unobservables, the authors find a substantial increase in the total quantity (servings per capita) of packaged food purchases attributable to shopping at this format. Because there is no effect on the nutritional quality of purchases, this translates into a substantial increase in calories, sugar, and saturated fat per capita. The increase comes primarily from storable and impulse foods, and it is drawn equally from foods that have positive and negative health halos.

To better support retention, it is important to understand how the revived relationship evolves and possibly ends again. To examine customers' repeat churn behavior, we develop a “mixture cure-competing risks” model, jointly estimating the duration of second lifetimes, multiple reasons for churn, and heterogeneity of customers in exhibiting a related churn reason. The proposed model is tested using a data set from a large telecommunications provider including information on customer behavior and marketing activities during customers' first and second lifetimes. We find support for the existence of a “cured” group of returning customers, defined as those who are not susceptible to churn for the same reason they churned previously. Our findings suggest that mitigating repeat churn behavior can extend customers' second lifetime tenure and increase profitability by $150,000 over the lifetime of the customers in the sample (leading to gains of over $15 million for deferring second-lifetime churn in a million returning customers), depending on the type of churn.","V.

Double Mental Discounting: When a Single Price Promotion Feels Twice as Nice,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0559,01-Apr-18,01-Apr,2018,55,2,226,238,"This research finds that when a single gain has strong associations with multiple costs, consumers often mentally deduct that gain from perceived costs multiple times. For example, with some price promotions (e.g., spend $200 now and receive a $50 gift card to spend in the future), consumers mentally deduct the value of the price promotion from the cost of the first purchase when they receive the promotion, as well as from the cost of the second purchase when they use the promotion. Multiple mental deductions based on a single gain result in consumers' perceptions that their costs are lower than they actually are, which can trigger higher expenditures. This mental accounting phenomenon, referred to as “double mental discounting,” is driven by the extent to which gains feel associated, or coupled, with multiple purchases. This article also documents methods to decouple promotional gains from purchases, thus mitigating double mental discounting.","Andong Cheng, Cynthia Cryder","mental accounting, pricing, financial decision making, coupling, price promotions",12,,,,

They propose that context effects resulting from the addition of a third option to a two-option set are more frequently observed when the added option is relatively similar (adjacent) to the “disadvantaged” alternative (i.e., the lower-share option) in the set.

Study 1, a natural longitudinal experiment, shows that a merger with a poorer-image firm immediately dilutes salespeople's organizational identification (OI), which in turn impairs their performance. As sense makers, salespeople who are more tenured experience stronger OI dilution, whereas those who perceive a high level of social inclusion experience weaker OI dilution. As sense givers, managers who emphasize the firm's strategic intent in their communication buffer the OI-dilution effect, whereas those who emphasize the firm's organizational culture aggravate the effect. Study 2, a scenario-based experiment, further demonstrates that the OI-dilution effect is stronger than the OI-enhancement effect from merging with a better-image firm. Furthermore, both studies confirm that the adverse effect of mergers and acquisitions that involve a mismatch of external image stems from image uncertainty rather than job uncertainty.","Raghu Bommaraju, Michael Ahearne, Zachary R.

Making Warnings about Misleading Advertising and Product Recalls more Effective: An Implicit Attitude Perspective,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0305,01-Apr-18,01-Apr,2018,55,2,265,276,"The authors tested whether image-based information is more effective than text in changing implicit attitudes from positive to negative, even when both forms similarly change explicit attitudes. They studied corrective information (i.e., warnings about misleading advertising and product recall notices) because it is a common, important effort to change consumer attitudes. Corrective information in the form of pictures or imagery-evoking text, as well as direct instructions to imagine the scene, changed implicit attitudes more than plain, descriptive text, which is currently the most common warning method. Image-based stimuli can change implicit attitudes because they evoke vivid visual mental imagery of counterattitudinal valence (Experiments 1–2). Conditions that hindered the formation of visual mental imagery blocked implicit attitude change, whereas cognitive busyness did not (Experiment 3). In short, imagery-based information changed both explicit and implicit attitudes, whereas materials not based on imagery changed only explicit attitudes.

How Deviations from Performance Norms Impact Charitable Donations,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0509,01-Apr-18,01-Apr,2018,55,2,277,290,"Although the actions of others can influence a consumer's behavior, these actions are often at odds with performance norms. For example, charities can experience relatively low rates of support (resulting in a negative deviation from a performance norm) or relatively high rates of support (resulting in a positive deviation from a performance norm). Previous research provides evidence of the equivocal effects of these deviations, with both positive and negative deviations motivating prosocial behaviors. The current research reconciles these competing findings by introducing construal as a moderator. Across four studies, the authors find that positive deviations from performance norms motivate prosocial behavior for independent donors, whereas negative deviations from performance norms motivate prosocial behavior for interdependent donors. They further show that these effects are driven by a prevention focus associated with interdependent consumers and a promotion focus associated with independent consumers. The article concludes with implications for the marketing of charities and prosocial behaviors.","Alexis M.

Might one's likelihood of agreeing to pursue a goal fluctuate even if nothing about the goal's objective features changes, but if instead the only change is in how the time allotted for goal pursuit is described? Seven experiments show that consumers are more likely to agree to pursue goals when the completion interval is described by duration (e.g., “within exactly two weeks from now”) instead of date (e.g., “between today and November 17”). This pattern may arise because dates, which may make it easier to retrieve competing obligations falling within the interval, lead people to focus more on the (unenjoyable) goal-pursuit process, whereas durations, which present the interval in isolation, allow people to focus more on the goal's (beneficial) outcome. These findings suggest that although how a time interval is described seems inconsequential, it has striking effects on goal-pursuit decisions and therefore has important implications for the marketing of products and actions designed to assist consumers in achieving their goals.","Nira Munichor, Robyn A.

This effect occurs because performance on the common feature is judged not at face value but relative to an expectation about which product should perform best on that feature. The effect holds even though performance on the common feature is clearly the same when alternatives are presented side by side. Finally, the authors demonstrate four boundary conditions of this effect.","Ioannis Evangelidis, Stijn M.J.

Model estimates reveal that wins in professional golf tournaments (which proxy for unplanned television exposure during weekly golf tournaments) affect awareness and that paid planned advertising impacts awareness and preferences. Focusing on Titleist equipment, counterfactual analysis demonstrates that the unplanned media exposure and planned advertising account for 22% and 24% of sales, respectively.

Therefore, the authors analyze marketing messages and employ content analysis to capture the two distinct types of direct marketing communications. Using data from a Fortune 500 business-to-business service firm and a robust econometric model, they find that the (1) effects of economic and relational marketing communication on customer purchase behaviors interplay and vary over time, (2) latent stock of direct marketing communication affects customer purchase behaviors, and (3) evolution of customers' perceived importance can be recovered using transaction data.

This effect has a more powerful impact on male customers who lack bodily markers of dominance (shorter stature or measures linked to lower levels of testosterone). When confronted with other physically dominant (vs. nondominant) men, these male customers are particularly prone to signal status through price or logo size. Their elevated feelings of intrasexual (male-to-male) competitiveness drive them to spend more money on status-signaling, but not functional, products and to prefer and draw larger brand logos.

Retention Futility: Targeting High-Risk Customers Might be Ineffective,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.16.0163,01-Feb-18,01-Feb,2018,55,1,80,98,"Companies in a variety of sectors are increasingly managing customer churn proactively, generally by detecting customers at the highest risk of churning and targeting retention efforts towards them. While there is a vast literature on developing churn prediction models that identify customers at the highest risk of churning, no research has investigated whether it is indeed optimal to target those individuals. Combining two field experiments with machine learning techniques, the author demonstrates that customers identified as having the highest risk of churning are not necessarily the best targets for proactive churn programs. This finding is not only contrary to common wisdom but also suggests that retention programs are sometimes futile not because firms offer the wrong incentives but because they do not apply the right targeting rules. Accordingly, firms should focus their modeling efforts on identifying the observed heterogeneity in response to the intervention and to target customers on the basis of their sensitivity to the intervention, regardless of their risk of churning. This approach is empirically demonstrated to be significantly more effective than the standard practice of targeting customers with the highest risk of churning. More broadly, the author encourages firms and researchers using randomized trials (or A/B tests) to look beyond the average effect of interventions and leverage the observed heterogeneity in customers' response to select customer targets.",Eva Ascarza,"churn/retention, proactive churn management, field experiments, heterogeneous treatment effect, machine learning",25,,,,

Accordingly, this study uses a proprietary, household-level, single-source data set to develop an instantaneous show and advertisement viewing model to forecast consumers' exposure to advertising and the downstream consequences for impressions and sales. Viewing data suggest that person-specific factors dwarf brand- or show-specific factors in explaining advertising avoidance, thereby suggesting that device-level advertising targeting can be more effective than existing show-level targeting. Consistent with this observation, the model indicates that microtargeting lowers advertising costs and raises incremental profits considerably relative to show-level targeting. Further, these advantages are amplified when advertisers can buy in real time as opposed to up front.","Yiting Deng, Carl F.

Theory suggests two likely mechanisms for this phenomenon: (1) better matching between referred customers and the firm and (2) social enrichment by the referrer.

Consistent with the theory that better matching affects contribution margins, (1) referrer–referral dyads exhibit shared unobservables in customer contribution margins, (2) referrers with more extensive experience bring in higher-margin referrals, and (3) this association between the referrer's experience and margin gap becomes smaller over the referral's lifetime. Consistent with the theory that social enrichment affects retention, referrals exhibit lower churn only as long as their referrer has not churned. These findings indicate that better matching and social enrichment are two mechanisms through which firms can leverage their customers' networks to gain new customers with higher customer lifetime value and convert social capital into economic capital. One recommendation for the managers of the firm studied is to recruit referrers among their customers who have been acquired at least six months ago, exhibit high margins, and are unlikely to churn.","Christophe Van Den Bulte, Emanuel Bayer, Bernd Skiera,...","customer referral programs, customer relationship marketing, referral marketing, social networks, word-of-mouth marketing",1,,,,

Second, the authors predict the perceptions and performance of new ads relative to the existing set using textual content metrics. The predictive model allows for direct effects and interactions of the text metrics, resulting in a “large p, small n” problem. They address this problem with a novel Bayesian implementation of the VANISH model, a penalized regression approach that allows for differential treatment of main and interaction effects, in a system of equations. The authors demonstrate that this approach ably forecasts relative ad performance by leveraging perceptions inferred from content alone.","Oliver J. Rutz, Garrett P.

What Happens Online Stays Online? Segment-Specific Online and Offline Effects of Banner Advertisements,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0625,01-Dec-17,01-Dec,2017,54,6,901,913,"Many firms are allocating increasing parts of their advertising budgets to banner advertising. Yet, for firms that predominantly sell offline, existing research provides little guidance on online advertising decisions. In this study, the authors analyze the impact of banner advertising on consumers’ online and offline behavior across multiple distinct campaigns for one focal firm, which predominantly sells through the offline channel. Results suggest that banner and TV advertising increase website visit incidence for consumers who have not visited the focal firm's website in the previous four weeks (nonrecent online consumers). For these consumers, banner and TV advertisements indirectly increase offline sales through website visits. For consumers who have visited the firm's website in the previous four weeks (recent online consumers), the authors find evidence for a cross-campaign, brand-building effect of banner advertising, and TV ads also directly affect offline purchases. Overall, the findings indicate that for firms that predominantly (or even exclusively) sell offline, banner advertising is most suitable to generate awareness for a firm's new products among nonrecent online consumers, and to build their brand(s) among recent online consumers.","Lara Lobschat, Ernst C.

Positioning Multicountry Brands: The Impact of Variation in Cultural Values and Competitive Set,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0058,01-Dec-17,01-Dec,2017,54,6,914,931,"Building on cultural values research, the authors identify specific image attributes on which multicountry brands should position themselves consistently across markets. Leveraging prior research, they identify three life values that are most equal (benevolence, universalism, and self-direction) and two that are least equal (power and hedonism) in cross-national importance. The authors link specific brand image attributes (e.g., friendly, social, elite style, arrogant) to these life values through empirical data and semantic analysis. Using an extensive field data set on consumer perceptions and preferences from 22 countries regarding more than 1,700 brands, the authors then show that greater global consistency of a brand's image decreases overall brand attitudes if the specific image attribute is one that is not equally desired worldwide. They also find that the attitudinal impact of a multicountry brand's positioning consistency on commonly valued image attributes is greater when the set of competitors the brand faces across its markets is more homogeneous.

While a time-based segmentation approach enables firms to identify consumers who are likely to adopt new products sooner than others, a profitability-based perspective can complement their targeting strategy and enhance overall profits.

The authors examine the individual and joint effects of deploying governance mechanisms that share the same underlying objective, namely, to enhance franchisee ability and motivation. They also assess how motivation-inducing mechanisms may serve to counter the motivation-dampening effect of an increased royalty rate.

Demand for “Healthy” Products: False Claims and FTC Regulation,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0398,01-Dec-17,01-Dec,2017,54,6,968,989,"Firms sometimes make selective or deceptive claims, which can have negative consequences for consumers, especially if consumers are not fully informed and the claims are hard to verify.

Using a panel data set of consumer purchases and firm advertising, the authors measure this impact by exploiting the fact that four popular products settled charges raised by the Federal Trade Commission. They further control for and document firm responses in terms of price and advertisement changes around the date of the settlement. Findings indicate a significant decline in demand following the termination of the claims, resulting in a 12%–67% monthly loss in revenue across the four products, which amounts to a $.40 million–$3.82 million loss in monthly revenue.

A Meta-Analysis of Marketing Communication Carryover Effects,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0580,01-Dec-17,01-Dec,2017,54,6,990,1008,"To optimally set marketing communication (“marcom”) budgets, reliable estimates of short-term elasticities and carryover effects are required. Empirical generalizations from meta-analyses of prior field studies can help guide these decisions.

The first is focused on and utilizes 918 estimates of the carryover proportion of the total effect, termed long-term share of the total effect, and the second focuses on 863 derivable estimates of 90% implied duration intervals. The authors find the mean long-term shares of the total effect for personal selling (.687) and targeted advertising (.650) are distinctly larger than that for mass media advertising (.523) and the corresponding median 90% implied duration intervals are 12.6, 2, and 3.4 months, respectively.

TV Channel Search and Commercial Breaks,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0121,01-Oct-17,01-Oct,2017,54,5,671,686,"This study investigates time lapses that interrupt product consumption. Preeminent examples are commercial breaks during television or radio programming. The authors suggest that breaks facilitate consumers’ search for alternatives. Specifically, when there is so much uncertainty that consumers are unclear about utility levels of different products, they engage in costly search to resolve the uncertainty. For TV programming, breaks lower the opportunity cost of search, allowing the consumer to sample alternative channels without further interrupting the viewing experience on the current channel. Using data from the Chinese TV market, the authors estimate a sequential search model to study consumer TV channel choice behavior. The data contain a quasi-natural experiment due to a Chinese government policy change on commercial breaks. The natural experiment creates exogenous variations in the data that enable the empirical identification of heterogeneous consumer preference and search cost. The data patterns support the idea that viewers search for alternatives during commercial breaks. Drawing on the estimates, the authors investigate how the timing of breaks affects TV channels’ viewership, offering insights about how to strategically adjust the timing of breaks.","Song Yao, Wenbo Wang, Yuxin Chen","advertising, television, consumer search, natural experiment, demand estimation",1,,,,

The authors explore the economic impact of the sharing economy on incumbent firms by studying the case of Airbnb, a prominent platform for short-term accommodations. They analyze Airbnb's entry into the state of Texas and quantify its impact on the Texas hotel industry over the subsequent decade. In Austin, where Airbnb supply is highest, the causal impact on hotel revenue is in the 8%–10% range; moreover, the impact is nonuniform, with lower-priced hotels and hotels that do not cater to business travelers being the most affected. The impact manifests itself primarily through less aggressive hotel room pricing, benefiting all consumers, not just participants in the sharing economy. The price response is especially pronounced during periods of peak demand, such as during the South by Southwest festival, and is due to a differentiating feature of peer-to-peer platforms—enabling instantaneous supply to scale to meet demand.","Georgios Zervas, Davide Proserpio, John W.

Can Offline Stores Drive Online Sales?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0518,01-Oct-17,01-Oct,2017,54,5,706,719,"The authors use evidence from store openings by a bricks-and-clicks retailer to examine the drivers of substitution and complementarity between online and offline retail channels. The evidence supports the coexistence of substitution across channels and complementarity in demand. In places where the retailer has a strong presence, the opening of an offline store is associated with a decrease in online sales and search; however, in places where the retailer does not have a strong presence, the opening of an offline store is associated with an increase in online sales and search. The evidence suggests that whereas online and offline channels may be substitutes in distribution, they are complements in marketing communications. Specifically, the type of marketing communication driving complementarity seems to be information about the existence of the brand. For example, the authors observe a large increase in new customer acquisition and sales, and little difference between fit and feel products and other products. Thus, it is the presence of the store, rather than information about the attributes of the products in the store, that drives complementarity.","Kitty Wang, Avi Goldfarb","channels/distribution, integrated marketing, online/offline, informative advertising",132,,,,
Predicting the Consequences of Marketing Policy Changes: A New Data Enrichment Method with Competitive Reactions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0498,01-Oct-17,01-Oct,2017,54,5,720,736,"This article introduces a new data enrichment method that combines revealed data on consumer demand and competitive reactions with stated data on competitive reactions to yet-to-be-enacted, unprecedented marketing policy changes.

The authors apply their method to investigate hypothetical and unprecedented sales force policy changes of pharmaceutical companies. The results from the data enrichment method have high face validity and lead to various unique insights compared with using revealed data only. The authors find that only a very large sales force decrease initiated by the market leader triggers all competitors to decrease their sales force as well, leading to substantial profit increases for each firm. With respect to sales force allocation, when competitors decrease their sales force, they mainly decrease the reach of detailing across doctors, rather than decreasing the number of details to the most-visited doctors. The proposed data enrichment method provides managers with a powerful tool to, ex ante, predict the consequences of unprecedented marketing policy changes.","Eelco Kappe, Sriram Venkataraman, Stefan Stremersch","data enrichment, marketing policy, sales force management, competitive reactions, pharmaceutical",,,,,
Seller Beware: How Bundling Affects Valuation,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0277,01-Oct-17,01-Oct,2017,54,5,737,751,"How does bundling affect valuation? This research proposes the asymmetry hypothesis in the valuation of bundles: consumers demand more compensation for the loss of items from bundles, compared with the loss of the same items in isolation, yet they express lower willingness to pay for items added to bundles, compared with the same items purchased separately. This asymmetry persists because bundling causes consumers to perceive multiple items as a single, inseparable gestalt unit. Thus, consumers resist altering the “whole” of the bundle by removing or adding items. Six studies demonstrate this asymmetry across judgments of monetary value (Studies 1 and 2) and (dis)satisfaction (Study 3). Moreover, bundle composition—the ability of different items to create the impression of a “whole”—moderates the effect of bundling on valuation (Study 4), and the need to replace missing items (i.e., restoring the “whole”) mediates the effect of bundling on compensation demanded for losses (Study 5). Finally, the authors explore a boundary condition: the effect is attenuated for items that complete a set (Study 6).","Franklin Shaddy, Ayelet Fishbach","bundling, pricing, gestalt, satisfaction",10,,,,

The framework presents a set of guidelines and recommendations to (1) involve stakeholders, (2) follow a data-driven iterative modeling approach, (3) increase validity through automated calibration, and (4) understand the DSS behavior. This framework is applied to build a DSS for a freemium app in which premium users discuss the product with their social network and promote its viral adoption. After its validation, the agent-based DSS forecasts the aggregate number of premium sales over time and the most likely users to become premium in the near future.

“Be Careless with That!” Availability of Product Upgrades Increases Cavalier Behavior toward Possessions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0131,01-Oct-17,01-Oct,2017,54,5,768,784,"Consumers are often faced with the opportunity to purchase a new, enhanced product, such as a new phone, even though the product they currently own is still fully functional. The authors propose that consumers act more recklessly with their current products when in the presence of appealing, though not yet attained, product upgrades (not just mere replacements). Carelessness and neglect toward currently owned products stem from a desire to justify the attainment of upgrades without appearing wasteful. A series of studies with actual owners of a wide range of different goods (durable, consumable, functional, and hedonic products) and evidence from a real-word data set of lost Apple iPhones demonstrate how the availability of product upgrades increases cavalier behavior toward possessions. Moreover, the authors demonstrate that product neglect in the presence of attractive upgrades can occur without deliberate intentions.

The authors conceptualize jilting as a multi-stage process, which consists of a pre-jilt anticipatory phase that is initiated on the introduction of an aspirant option and a post-jilt phase that is initiated when the aspirant option becomes inaccessible. They show that during the anticipatory phase, a process of denigration specific to the incumbent option is engendered. The subsequent jilt elicits a negative emotional response. During the affectively charged post-jilt phase, preference shifts away from the now-denigrated incumbent option, yielding a jilting effect. In four field and laboratory studies, the authors establish this jilting effect, rule out alternative accounts, and discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings.","Aaron M.

Interpreting the Stock Returns to New Product Announcements: How the past Shapes Investors’ Expectations of the Future,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0119,01-Oct-17,01-Oct,2017,54,5,799,815,"Investors routinely follow firms’ communications and actions to form expectations about the firms’ future performance. The authors propose a set of firm and industry characteristics that influence the formation of investor expectations in the context of new product announcements. Specifically, they argue that positive expectations of future innovation output should cause an ex-ante increase in stock prices and a smaller ex-post market reaction when an actual new product is announced. Using a sample of 4,865 new product announcements made by 826 publicly traded U.S. firms, the authors show that the stock market reaction to a new product announcement measured in a five-day window around the announcement is negatively related to (1) the number of new products previously announced by the firm, (2) the average number of new products previously announced by the firm's competitors, and (3) the average sentiment of past public news about the firm. These three factors are also positively related to the market value of the firm measured immediately before each new announcement, controlling for increases in firm value directly attributable to past new product announcements. In contrast to many articles in the marketing literature that imply that the added value of a marketing event can be fully assessed from the stock market reaction to the announcement of the event, the authors clarify that for recurrent events or events that are part of a firm's broader strategy, this reaction reflects only an update of investors’ expectations of future firm performance.","Nooshin L.

Instead, the self-expressive customization of a product extends an identity (e.g., personal identity, group identity) into the product.

They find conditional compensation in the form of quota bonus incentives to improve performance; however, such compensation may lead to lower future performance. The authors find little difference in effectiveness between a quota bonus plan and punitive bonus plans framed as a penalty for not achieving quota. They find that unconditional compensation, in the form of reciprocity, is effective at improving sales force performance only when it is given as a delayed reward; however, the effectiveness of this plan decreases with repeated exposure. The authors also find heterogeneity in the impact of compensation on performance across salespeople, such that unconditional compensation is more effective for salespeople with high base performance, whereas conditional compensation is equally effective across all types of salespeople.","Doug J.

The findings from two randomized field experiments reveal that labeling crowdsourced new products as such—that is, marketing the product as “customer-ideated” at the point of purchase versus not mentioning the specific source of design—increased the product's actual market performance by up to 20%. Two controlled follow-up studies reveal that the effect observed in two distinct consumer goods domains (food and electronics) can be attributed to a quality inference: consumers perceive “customer-ideated” products to be based on ideas that address their needs more effectively, and the corresponding design mode is considered superior in generating promising new products.","Hidehiko Nishikawa, Martin Schreier, Christoph Fuchs,...","crowdsourcing, idea generation, user involvement, new products, customer-centric innovation",46,,,,

Consequently, consumers frequently buy product upgrades that they would not have bought had they followed their own advice. Five experiments, involving both real and hypothetical upgrade decisions, show that even when the status quo option is represented in the decision context, if consumers are not explicitly prompted to reflect on it or compare it with the upgraded option, they often do not compare it with the upgrade and thus show an elevated likelihood of upgrading. The experiments suggest that this “comparison neglect” increases upgrade likelihood by making people overlook the similarities between the upgraded and status quo options and that it persists even when deliberation effort is high.

Five studies, including textual analysis of more than 1,000 online reviews, demonstrate that compared to more implicit endorsements (e.g., “I liked it,” “I enjoyed it”), explicit endorsements (e.g., “I recommend it”) are more persuasive and increase purchase intent. This occurs because explicit endorsers are perceived to like the product more and have more expertise. Looking at the endorsement language consumers actually use, however, shows that while consumer knowledge does affect endorsement style, its effect actually works in the opposite direction. Because novices are less aware that others have heterogeneous product preferences, they are more likely to use explicit endorsements. Consequently, the endorsement styles novices and experts tend to use may lead to greater persuasion by novices. These findings highlight the important role that language, and endorsement styles in particular, plays in shaping the effects of word of mouth.","Grant Packard, Jonah Berger","word of mouth, language, persuasion, consumer knowledge, social perception",47,,,,
Rejecting Responsibility: Low Physical Involvement in Obtaining Food Promotes Unhealthy Eating,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0125,01-Aug-17,01-Aug,2017,54,4,589,604,"Five experiments show that less physical involvement in obtaining food leads to less healthy food choices.

Further, when participants are given the opportunity to choose their portion size, they select larger portions of unhealthy foods when less (vs. more) physical involvement is required to help themselves to the food; again, this is not the case for healthy foods.

These propositions are tested in several ways. First, when a beautiful recipient is included in basic choice sets, this recipient becomes the most popular option and increases donor satisfaction. Second, heightening deliberation steers choices away from beautiful recipients and toward needier ones. Third, donors explicitly state that they “want” to give to beautiful recipients but “should” give to less beautiful, needier ones.

Do Costly Options Lead to Better Outcomes?

Such cost–benefit heuristics in goal pursuit have been observed across several domains, but their antecedents have not been fully explored. In this research, the authors propose that a person's tendency to use cost–benefit heuristics depends on the extent to which that person subscribes to the Protestant Work Ethic (PWE), an influential concept originally introduced to explain the rise of capitalism. The PWE is a core value predicated on the work-specific belief that hard work leads to success, but people who subscribe strongly to it tend to overgeneralize and align other work-unrelated cognitions for consistency. Across ten studies (N = 1,917) measuring and manipulating PWE, robust findings show that people who are high (vs. low) in PWE are more likely to use cost–benefit heuristics and are more likely to choose costlier means in pursuit of superior outcomes. Suggestions are provided for how marketers may identify consumers high versus low in PWE and tailor their offerings accordingly.","Yimin Cheng, Anirban Mukhopadhyay, Rom Y.

Mobility of Top Marketing and Sales Executives in Business-to-Business Markets: A Social Network Perspective,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0124,01-Aug-17,01-Aug,2017,54,4,650,670,"In business-to-business markets, top marketing and sales executives (TMSEs) have considerable influence on their organizations’ customer strategies. When TMSEs switch firms, a pattern of informal organizational connections results; this pattern reflects the flow of information and knowledge among firms and creates managerial social capital in the process. To model this information flow, the current study considers information reach and richness, conceptualized according to the network position (i.e., centrality and brokerage) of the firm in the TMSE mobility network, which can be constructed by tracing executive movements through the work experience records of TMSEs in an industry. TMSE tenure (i.e., time with the firm) and firm market orientation constitute critical moderators, which capture motivation and ability at the individual and firm level, respectively. Data from the semiconductor industry and a model that corrects for unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity suggest that managerial social capital enhances firm performance; however, TMSE tenure and firm market orientation are essential for absorbing the benefits of managerial social capital.","Rui Wang, Aditya Gupta, Rajdeep Grewal","chief marketing officer tenure, executive affiliations, managerial social capital, motivation–ability, social network",,,,,
Beyond the Target Customer: Social Effects of Customer Relationship Management Campaigns,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0442,01-Jun-17,01-Jun,2017,54,3,347,363,"Customer relationship management (CRM) campaigns have traditionally focused on maximizing the profitability of the targeted customers. The authors demonstrate that in business settings characterized by network externalities, a CRM campaign that is aimed at changing the behavior of specific customers propagates through the social network, thereby also affecting the behavior of nontargeted customers. Using a randomized field experiment involving nearly 6,000 customers of a mobile telecommunication provider, they find that the social connections of targeted customers increase their consumption and become less likely to churn, due to a campaign that was neither targeted at them nor offered them any direct incentives. The authors estimate a social multiplier of 1.28. That is, the effect of the campaign on first-degree connections of targeted customers is 28% of the effect of the campaign on the targeted customers. By further leveraging the randomized experimental design, the authors show that, consistent with a network externality account, the increase in activity among the nontargeted but connected customers is driven by the increase in communication between the targeted customers and their connections, making the local network of the nontargeted customers more valuable. These findings suggest that in targeting CRM marketing campaigns, firms should consider not only the profitability of the targeted customer but also the potential spillover of the campaign to nontargeted but connected customers.","Eva Ascarza, Peter Ebbes, Oded Netzer,...","social effects, network effects, field experiment, mobile",438,,,,
Social Interactions and Monetary Incentives in Driving Consumer Repeat Behavior,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0482,01-Jun-17,01-Jun,2017,54,3,364,380,"Companies are eager to leverage social interactions among consumers by embedding social networking tools on their websites and actively integrating marketing actions with consumers' social activities. In this article, the authors investigate the impact of online social interactions on repeat usage behavior and the effectiveness of monetary incentives by formulating a model that parses out the effects of these individual factors. Using a unique data set from a wellness program, they find that online social interactions play a key role in driving repeat behavior, and after controlling for contemporaneous correlations from same-office friends, the social influence emanates even from distant friends working in different offices. The authors also find that monetary incentives have a significant impact on repeat usage and that ignoring this may overstate the impact of social influence. Furthermore, what-if scenario analyses show that social interactions are more effective than monetary incentives when both are present. The authors then explore social influence theories to understand the underlying process mechanisms that may operate in the repeat usage context. Using these findings, they offer strategic implications for marketing practice.","Kamer Toker-Yildiz, Minakshi Trivedi, Jeonghye Choi,...","social interactions, repeat usage, online networking, monetary incentives, reward programs",,,,,
Why Do Salespeople Quit? An Empirical Examination of Own and Peer Effects on Salesperson Turnover Behavior,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0485,01-Jun-17,01-Jun,2017,54,3,381,397,"Salesperson turnover can have a negative overall effect on a firm. Research on salesperson turnover has conceptually studied the consequences of voluntary turnover on a firm. However, little empirical research has investigated the antecedents of salesperson turnover—specifically, the role of own effects (relative performance, customer satisfaction, and goal realization) and peer effects (peer performance variance and turnover). Therefore, the authors propose a framework to assess the influence of own factors (through identity theory) and of peer factors (through social identity theory) on salesperson turnover. Using a proportional hazard model implemented on data consisting of 6,727 salespeople over two years, the results suggest that in addition to own behaviors, managers need to pay attention to peer behaviors because peer turnover (voluntary and involuntary) greatly increases a salesperson's turnover probability. Furthermore, the results indicate that peer effects have a greater impact than own effects. This research has implications for sales force management because it helps managers (1) identify a salesperson's turnover risk, (2) diagnose the drivers of turnover behavior, and (3) build strategies to prevent salesperson turnover.","Sarang Sunder, V.

Extracting Summary Piles from Sorting Task Data,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0388,01-Jun-17,01-Jun,2017,54,3,398,414,"In a sorting task, consumers receive a set of representational items (e.g., products, brands) and sort them into piles such that the items in each pile “go together.” The sorting task is flexible in accommodating different instructions and has been used for decades in exploratory marketing research in brand positioning and categorization. However, no general analytic procedures yet exist for analyzing sorting task data without performing arbitrary transformations to the data that influence the results and insights obtained. This manuscript introduces a flexible framework for analyzing sorting task data, as well as a new optimization approach to identify summary piles, which provide an easy way to explore associations consumers make among a set of items. Using two Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application of single-serving snacks from a local retailer, the authors demonstrate that the resulting procedure is scalable, can provide additional insights beyond those offered by existing procedures, and requires mere minutes of computational time.","Simon J.

Mortgage decisions are also prototypical of consumer financial choices that involve a stream of expenditures and consumption occurring across time. The authors use heterogeneity in time preferences for both immediate (present bias) and long-term outcomes to explain a sequence of mortgage decisions, including mortgage choice and the decision to abandon a mortgage. The authors employ an analytic model and a survey of mortgaged households augmented by zip code–level house price and foreclosure data. The model suggests and data confirm that consumers with greater present bias and long-term discounting tend to choose mortgages that minimize up-front costs. However, greater present bias decreases homeowners' willingness to abandon a mortgage, locking them into the contract. Long-term patience increases mortgage abandonment. This reversal across mortgage decisions is difficult for alternative accounts to explain. These results suggest that a two-parameter model of time preferences is helpful for understanding how homeowners make mortgage decisions.","Stephen A. Atlas, Eric J. Johnson, John W.

Efficient Design and Analysis for a Selective Choice Process,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0545,01-Jun-17,01-Jun,2017,54,3,430,446,"Variable selection is a decision heuristic that describes a selective choice process in which choices are made on the basis of only a subset of product attributes while the presence of other (“inactive”) attributes plays no active role in the decision. Within this context, the authors address two integrated topics that have received scant attention: the efficient design of choice experiments and the analysis of data that arises from a selective choice process. The authors propose a new dual-objective compound design criterion that incorporates prior information for the joint purpose of efficiently estimating the effects of the active attributes and detecting the effects of attributes labeled as inactive that may turn out to be active. The approach leverages self-stated auxiliary data as prior information both for individual-level customized design construction and in a heterogeneous variable selection model. The authors demonstrate the efficiency advantages of the approach relative to design benchmarks and highlight practical implications using both simulated data and actual data from a conjoint choice experiment in which individual designs were customized instantaneously using self-stated active-inactive attribute status.","Ty Henderson, Qing Liu","variable selection, selective choice process, customized conjoint choice designs, compound design criterion, heterogeneous variable selection model",,,,,

Results of a field study using Apple's App Store, a follow-up survey, and two laboratory experiments provide consistent evidence for the predicted pattern. In addition, the results suggest that the nonlinear effect is explained in part by perceptions of reviewer effort and that the effect is stronger for products that are utilitarian in nature.

Furthermore, consumer perceptions of firms' greenness and consumer conservation behavior depend on (1) whether the firm asks consumers to conserve resources, (2) the firm's own commitment to the environment, and (3) the firm's price image. In addition, firm requests to consumers to save resources can create consumer reactance and can backfire when firms themselves do not engage in visible costly environmental efforts. Such reactance is more likely for firms with a high-price image. Finally, the authors show that by spending a little money to signal environmental commitment, firms can save even more money through consumers' conservation of resources, resulting in wins for the firm, the consumer, and the environment.","Wenbo Wang, Aradhna Krishna, Brent McFerran","sustainability, green marketing, corporate social responsibility, price image, field experiment",85,,,,

They demonstrate how an explicitly defined emergency reserve not only is preferred over other options for goal-related programs but can also lead to increased persistence. Study 1 demonstrates that consumers prefer programs with emergency reserves to programs that do not have them, and Study 2 further clarifies that consumers' preference for an emergency reserve depends on the presence of a superordinate goal. Study 3 reveals that consumers prefer goals with emergency reserves because they perceive them to have both higher attainability and value than other goals. Study 4 demonstrates that reserves can lead to increased goal persistence in a realistic task that involves persistence over time. Finally, Studies 5 and 6 reveal that consumers persist more with reserve goals because they want to avoid using the “emergency” reserve.","Marissa A. Sharif, Suzanne B.

Specifically, the author demonstrates how both advertising and price elasticities and observed advertising and prices evolve along these cycles for a unique set of 252 brands—ranging from high-advertising, high-priced “premium mass” brands to low-advertising, low-priced “value niche” brands—in 61 consumer packaged goods categories. Overall, both advertising efectiveness and observed advertising are found to be stronger at demand peaks. Surprisingly, consumer reactions to price decreases are weaker at demand peaks, whereas reactions to price increases remain unchanged. However, effectiveness evolutions and observed action patterns along these intrayear cycles are both markedly diverse across the different types of brands.",Maarten J.

Uncovering the Importance of Relationship Characteristics in Social Networks: Implications for Seeding Strategies,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0511,01-Apr-17,01-Apr,2017,54,2,187,201,"Seeding influential social network members is crucial for the success of a viral marketing campaign and product diffusion.

However, the importance of connections between customers varies substantially depending on the relationship's characteristics, such as its type (i.e., friend, colleague, or acquaintance), duration, and interaction intensity. This research introduces a new Bayesian methodology to identify influential network members and takes into account the relative influence of different relationship characteristics on product diffusion. Two applications of the proposed methodology—the launch of a microfinance program across 43 Indian villages and information propagation in a large online social network—demonstrate the importance of weighting connections in social networks. Compared with traditional seeding strategies, the proposed methodology recommends substantially different sets of seeds that increased the reach by up to 10% in the first empirical application and up to 92% in the second.","Xi Chen, Ralf Van Der Lans, Tuan Q.

To this end, the authors obtain six months of data on daily impressions, clicks, targeting, and ad creative content from a major U.S. retailer, and they develop a dynamic zero-inflated count model. Given the sparse, nonlinear, and non-Gaussian nature of the data, the study designs a particle filter/Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme for estimation. Results show that carry-over rates for dynamic formats are greater than those for static formats; however, static formats can still be effective for price ads and retargeting. Most notably, results also show that retargeted ads are effective only if they offer price incentives.

Influencing Acquisition Performance in High-Technology Industries: The Role of Innovation and Relational Overlap,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0556,01-Apr-17,01-Apr,2017,54,2,219,238,"Acquisition is an important activity that enables firms to adapt their resource configurations. Acquisition literature has focused only on the levels of innovation or relational resources, the primary dimensions of organizational resource bases. The authors argue that in addition to the levels, the degree of overlap between the acquiring and target firms, in terms of innovation and relational resources, should influence acquisitions. Furthermore, they argue for the importance of the quality of the target's resources along with factors influencing the acquirer's absorptive capacity (e.g., the chief executive officer's [CEO's] functional background and the acquiring firm's marketing intensity and acquisition experience) as contingencies. Using 319 biopharmaceutical acquisitions and a random-effect regression model that accounts for unobserved heterogeneity and the endogeneity of relational and innovation overlap, the authors find that innovation overlap has a positive effect, whereas relational overlap has a negative effect, on acquisition outcomes. Furthermore, the acquirer CEO's throughput background and acquisition experience negatively moderate, whereas the target's innovation resource quality and the acquirer's marketing intensity positively moderate, the influence of innovation overlap.

The results reveal significant heterogeneity in the disclosure of customer metrics across firms and between industries. On average, in both industries, firms make more backward-looking than forward-looking disclosures.

This impact is weakened, however, when CEOs have low power, when a high proportion of their compensation comes from equity, when the marketing department has high influence in the top management team, and when the economy is growing. Liberal CEOs’ greater rate of NPIs is associated with superior Tobin's q but also higher stock return volatility. Findings based on observations of 421 publicly listed U.S. firms from 2006 to 2010 provide considerable support for the authors’ hypotheses.

However, how those attributes are expressed has important consequences for their choices and thus for conclusions drawn by market researchers about attribute importance. Expanded attribute scales (e.g., expressing exercise time in minutes) leads consumers to perceive greater differences between scale levels than contracted scales (e.g., expressing exercise time in hours). The authors show in two domains that simply expanding an attribute's scale can shift choice toward alternatives that perform well on a scale that is expanded and thus can impact conjoint results such as attribute importance and screening. Thus, practitioners should take care when they choose precisely how to elicit preferences or how to describe their products: the extent of the scale's expansion will determine researchers’ inferences about the importance of the attribute it describes. By illustrating the curvilinear relationship between scale expansion and multiple measures, the authors also offer practitioners some insight into the limits of scale expansion.","Anocha Aribarg, Katherine A.

The Effect of Recycling versus Trashing on Consumption: Theory and Experimental Evidence,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0574,01-Apr-17,01-Apr,2017,54,2,293,305,"This article proposes a utilitarian model in which recycling could reduce consumers’ negative emotions from wasting resources (i.e., taking more resources than what is being consumed) and increase consumers’ positive emotions from disposing of consumed resources. The authors provide evidence for each component of the utility function using a series of choice problems and formulate hypotheses on the basis of a parsimonious utilitarian model. Experiments with real disposal behavior support the model hypotheses. The findings suggest that the positive emotions associated with recycling can overpower the negative emotions associated with wasting. As a result, consumers could use a larger amount of resources when recycling is an option, and more strikingly, this amount could go beyond the point at which their marginal consumption utility becomes zero. The authors extend the theoretical model and introduce acquisition utility and the moderating effect of the costs of recycling (financial, physical, and mental). From a policy perspective, this research argues for a better understanding of consumers’ disposal behavior to increase the effectiveness of environmental policies and campaigns.","Monic Sun, Remi Trudel","behavioral economics, sustainability, recycling, disposal, self-conscious emotions",181,,,,

No effect of acquired page likes is found when customers interact organically with the firm's page, but a significant effect is found when the firm pays to boost its page posts and thus uses its Facebook page as a platform for paid advertising.

Valuable Virality,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0350,01-Apr-17,01-Apr,2017,54,2,318,330,"Given recent interest in social media, many brands now create content that they hope consumers will view and share with peers. While some campaigns indeed go “viral,” their value to the brand is limited if they do not boost brand evaluation or increase purchase. Consequently, a key question is how to create valuable virality, or content that is not only shared but also beneficial to the brand. Share data from hundreds of real online ads, as well as controlled laboratory experiments, demonstrate that compared with informative appeals (which focus on product features), emotional appeals (which use drama, mood, music, and other emotion-eliciting strategies) are more likely to be shared. Informative appeals, in contrast, boost brand evaluations and purchase because the brand is an integral part of the ad content. By combining the benefits of both approaches, emotional brand-integral ads boost sharing while also bolstering brand-related outcomes. The authors’ framework sheds light on how companies can generate valuable virality and the mechanisms underlying these effects.","Ezgi Akpinar, Jonah Berger","viral marketing, social transmission, online content, advertising",25,,,,

Through six studies, the authors find that when associated with a product, lower pitch in voice or music leads consumers to infer a larger product size. Furthermore, evidence shows that this pitch–size effect occurs through a process of visual mental imagery, which can be facilitated through stronger visualization cues delivered via auditory channels and reduced when size perceptions are assessed directly in the presence of visual product information. The cross-modal effects between auditory stimuli and physical products represent an unexplored influence on consumer perception and behavior with important managerial and theoretical implications.","Michael L.

In the second module, the author defines the conditional monotonicity property, derives conditions under which a data-generating process satisfies it, and demonstrates its role in generating cycles. A key challenge in estimating this model is the presence of endogenous lagged dependent variables, which the author addresses using system generalized method of moments estimators. Third, the author presents methods that exploit the longitudinal and geographic variations in agents' economic and cultural capital to examine the different theories of fashion.

Using a game-theoretic model, we derive the very sharp predictions that when winning the contest depends on the average team sales, the ability composition of a team has no effect on team effort, and the stronger and weaker members will expend identical effort levels. However, when the contest winner is determined by the minimum or maximum output contribution within the team, heterogeneity in team composition exerts a deleterious effect on team effort, with the stronger and weaker members expending unequal effort. Our model also shows that in a contest between two symmetric teams, when team members are homogeneous, all three contest metrics yield identical team effort; however, when team members are heterogeneous, the average metric elicits the highest team effort. We also discuss cases when the minimum and maximum metrics are optimal. We test the model's empirical validity using two incentive-aligned experiments in which participants make effort decisions strategically. The experimental results exhibit broad support for the theoretical predictions.","Hua Chen, Noah Lim","sales contests, strategic alliances, tournaments, team incentives, experimental economics",,,,,
Clicks as a Healthy Alternative to Bricks: How Online Grocery Shopping Reduces Vice Purchases,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0490,01-Feb-17,01-Feb,2017,54,1,61,74,"Although consumers are concerned about their health, obesity statistics suggest that contextual factors often lead them to choose unhealthy alternatives (i.e., vices) rather than healthy ones (i.e., virtues). Noting the increasing prevalence of online grocery shopping, the authors focus on shopping channels as one such contextual factor and investigate how food choices made online differ from food choices made in a traditional brick-and-mortar store. A database study and three lab experiments demonstrate that consumers choose relatively fewer vices in the online shopping environment. Moreover, this shopping channel effect arises because online channels present products symbolically, whereas offline stores present them physically. A symbolic presentation mode decreases the products' vividness, which in turn diminishes consumers' desire to seek instant gratification and ultimately leads them to purchase fewer vices. These findings highlight several unexplored differences between online and offline shopping, with important implications for consumers, public policy makers, and retailers.","Elke Huyghe, Julie Verstraeten, Maggie Geuens,...","grocery shopping, unhealthy food choices, product presentation, shopping channel, instant gratification",26,,,,

The authors show that sellers alter their initial price quotes depending on whether consumers appear to be correctly informed, uninformed, or misinformed about market prices. The authors find that repair shops quote higher prices to callers who cite a higher benchmark price and that women are quoted higher prices than men when callers signal that they are uninformed about market prices. However, gender differences disappear when callers mention a benchmark price for the repair.

Although extant research has focused on the effect of adding amenities on choice, return on service amenities may arise from two sources: increased initial choice and increased revenues from repurchase. The authors develop a return on investment (ROI) model to capture how service amenities produce financial return from these two sources. They apply the model to hotel amenities, using a discrete choice experiment and a large-scale customer database developed in collaboration with a multibrand global hotel company. The authors employ a hierarchical Bayesian formulation to estimate the parameters. They use the estimation results to compare ROI for three amenities for six brands and find that returns vary across amenities, and returns on a single amenity can vary substantially across brands. The authors validate the results for one amenity against the ROI from the actual historical implementation of that amenity using a natural experiment with a before/after design with controls. The present research demonstrates that the return on service amenities model provides a useful decision tool for managers deciding which amenities are most profitable.","Rebecca W.

The results of a field study at multiple locations of a major restaurant chain and a series of lab studies robustly show that consumers tend to choose less healthy food options when ambient lighting is dim (vs. bright). Process evidence suggests that this phenomenon occurs because ambient light luminance influences mental alertness, which in turn influences food choices. While restaurant and grocery store managers can use these insights and their ambient light switches to nudge consumers toward targeted food choices, such as healthy or high-margin signature items, health-conscious consumers can opt for dining environments with bright ambient lighting.","Dipayan Biswas, Courtney Szocs, Roger Chacko,...","ambient light, retail atmospherics, luminance, healthy/unhealthy food choices, sensory marketing",554,,,,

Or is “liking” simply a symptom of being fond of a brand? The authors disentangle these possibilities and find evidence for the latter: brand attitudes and purchasing are predicted by consumers' preexisting fondness for brands, and these are the same regardless of when and whether consumers “like” brands on social media. In addition, we explore possible second-order effects by examining whether “liking” brands might cause consumers' friends to view that brand more favorably. When consumers see that a friend has “liked” a brand, they are less likely to buy the brand relative to when they learn that a friend genuinely likes the brand in the offline sense, which is a more meaningful social endorsement. Taken together, five experiments and two meta-analyses (N > 14,000) suggest that turning “liking” into improved brand attitudes and increased purchasing by consumers and their friends may require more than just the click of a button.","Leslie K.

“Mere Measurement Plus”: How Solicitation of Open-Ended Positive Feedback Influences Customer Purchase Behavior,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0232,01-Feb-17,01-Feb,2017,54,1,156,170,"In two studies (a longitudinal field experiment with an established business-to-consumer national chain, and a field experiment with a business-to-business software manufacturer), the authors demonstrate that starting a survey with an open-ended positive solicitation increases customer purchase behavior. Study 1, a longitudinal field experiment, shows that one year after the completion of a survey that began by asking customers what went well during their purchase experience, those customers spent 8.25% more than customers who had completed a survey that did not include the positive solicitation. Study 2 utlizes multiple treatment groups to assess the stepwise gains of solicitation, measurement, and solicitation frame. The results demonstrate (1) a mere solicitation effect, (2) a traditional mere measurement effect, and (3) an additional “mere measurement plus” effect of an open-ended positive solicitation; all effects increased customer spending. Specifically, starting a survey with an open-ended positive solicitation resulted in a 32.88% increase in customer spending relative to a survey with no open-ended positive solicitation. The findings suggest that firms can proactively influence the feedback process. Soliciting open-ended positive feedback can create positively biased memories of an experience; the subsequent expression of those memories in an open-ended feedback format further reinforces them, making them more salient and accessible in guiding future purchase behavior.","Sterling A.

This effect appears to result from interactions between the design of search results and users’ decisions about where and how to focus their attention: users who decide what to click on the basis of relevance were more likely to select paid listings, whereas users who are influenced by visual presentation and page position were more likely to click on Google's own Flight Search listing.

Measuring the Lifetime Value of a Customer in the Consumer Packaged Goods Industry,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0641,01-Dec-16,01-Dec,2016,53,6,901,921,"In this study, the authors propose a flexible framework to assess customer lifetime value (CLV) in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) context. They address the substantive and modeling challenges that arise in this setting, namely, (1) multiple discreteness, (2) brand switching, and (3) budget-constrained consumption. Using a Bayesian estimation, the authors are also able to infer the consumer's latent budgetary constraint using only transaction information, thus enabling managers to understand the customer's budgetary constraint without having to survey or depend on aggregate measures of budget constraints. Using the proposed framework, CPG manufacturers can assess CLV at the focal brand level as well as at the category level, a departure from CLV literature, which has mostly been firm centric. The authors implement the proposed model on panel data in the carbonated beverages category and showcase the benefits of the proposed model over simpler heuristics and conventional CLV approaches. Finally, they conduct two policy simulations describing the role of the budget constraint on CLV, as well as the asymmetric effects of pricing in this setting, and develop managerial insights in this context.","Sarang Sunder, V.

Although the benefits of scheduling are well established, its potential downsides are not well understood. The authors examine whether scheduling uniquely undermines the benefits of leisure activities. In 13 studies using unambiguous leisure activities that consumers commonly schedule (e.g., movies, a coffee break), they find that scheduling a leisure activity (vs. experiencing it impromptu) makes it feel less free-flowing and more work-like. Furthermore, scheduling diminishes utility from leisure activities, in terms of both excitement in anticipation of the activities and experienced enjoyment. Importantly, the authors find that maintaining the free-flowing nature of the activity by “roughly scheduling” (without prespecified times) eliminates this effect, thus indicating that the effect is driven by a detriment from scheduling rather than by a boost from spontaneity. The reported findings highlight an important opportunity for marketers to improve consumers’ experiences and utility by leveraging scheduling behavior while also providing important implications for consumer well-being from leisure consumption.","Gabriela N.

When Remembering Disrupts Knowing: Blocking Implicit Price Memory,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0335,01-Dec-16,01-Dec,2016,53,6,937,953,"Does explicit recall help or hurt memory-based comparisons? It is often assumed that attempting to recall information from memory should facilitate—or at least not disrupt—memory-based comparisons. Using the domain of price comparisons, the authors demonstrate that memory-based price comparisons are less accurate when consumers first attempt to recall the past price versus when they do not try to do so. Attempting—and failing at—explicit price recall focuses attention on metacognitive experience, resulting in a feeling-of-not-knowing, which then blocks the implicit memory that people could otherwise use to make accurate price comparisons. Drawing attention to this metacognitive feeling-of-not-knowing increases the blocking effect of recall on implicit memory, whereas drawing attention away from the feeling reduces the blocking effect. The results identify a new type of memory blocking—metacognitive memory blocking—in which the feeling-of-not-knowing blocks implicit memory during judgments. They also provide further evidence of dual representations of price memory and demonstrate that most memory-based price comparisons are based on implicit memory and do not entail explicit recall of the reference price.","Ellie J.

This effect is cognitive; specifically, anticipating variety in future consumption generates positive thoughts about that future experience. The authors find two boundary conditions: the future consumption outcome must be (1) in a related product category and (2) at least as attractive as the present consumption outcome. The authors rule out potential alternative explanations such as mere exposure to variety, the possibility that the future experience is more attractive (rather than just different) than the current one, and perceptions of scarcity associated with the item consumed in the present.","Julio Sevilla, Jiao Zhang, Barbara E.

They find that firms’ behavior differs significantly from the predictions of the standard economic model and is consistent with the existence of fairness concerns. Using a quantal response equilibrium model, in which both manufacturer and retailer make noisy best responses, the authors show that fairness significantly affects channel pricing decisions. In addition, they investigate what affects the perceptions of fairness. More specifically, they analyze whether the notion of fairness is influenced by social norms of strict equality, by endogenous investments and contributions that are affected by players’ decisions, or by the exogenous game structure. To do so, the authors compare four principles of distributive fairness: strict egalitarianism; liberal egalitarianism; libertarianism; and a sequence-aligned ideal, which is studied for the first time in the literature. Surprisingly, the exogenous game structure reflected by the new ideal, whereby the sequence of moving determines the equitable payoff for players, significantly outperforms other fairness ideals, suggesting that equity in distribution channels can arise even in contests in which channel members have fairly different payoffs.","Tony Haitao Cui, Paola Mallucci","fairness ideals, distribution channels, quantal response equilibrium, experimental economics",,,,,

The authors develop an analytical framework to investigate the effects of the consumer's inequity aversion on a firm's optimal pricing and quality decisions. They highlight several findings. First, because of the consumer's uncertainty about the firm's cost, the firm's optimal quality may be nonmonotone with respect to the degree of the consumer's inequity aversion. Second, stronger inequity aversion makes an inefficient firm worse off but may benefit an efficient firm. Third, stronger inequity aversion by the consumer can actually lower the consumer's monetary payoff (economic surplus) because the firm may reduce its quality to a greater extent than it reduces its price. Finally, as the expected cost efficiency in the market decreases, both the expected quality and the social surplus may increase rather than decrease.","Xiaomeng Guo, Baojun Jiang","behavioral economics, fairness, inequity aversion, asymmetric information, signaling, quality, pricing, search goods",,,,,

The authors find that close givers’ divergence from the registry is not the result of their altruistic search for a “better” gift but is a strategic effort to express relational signals: it occurs only when givers will receive attribution for their choice. They show that close givers reconcile their goal conflict by engaging in motivated reasoning, which results in their perceptual distortion of the gift options in favor of relational-signaling gifts.

What might affect how much variety people choose? Five experiments demonstrate that how much variety consumers prefer for joint consumption in committed relationships depends on their relationship time perspective (i.e., the perceived time ahead in the relationship). When consumers perceive more (vs. less) time ahead in a committed relationship, they prefer more variety for joint consumption with their partners. This increased preference for variety is driven by a shift in how much excitement is valued within the relationship and is unique to choices for joint consumption with the specific relationship partner.

It is demonstrated that this processing fluency allows people to browse information more efficiently, which increases perceived assortment variety and ultimately leads to more variety being chosen, and if the number of options chosen is allowed to vary, it leads to more options chosen. It is shown that because people see more variety in a horizontal (vs. vertical) display, they process a horizontal assortment more extensively. When more variety is positive, they find the choice task easier and have a higher level of satisfaction and confidence about their choices. When more variety is not necessarily positive, for example, in a choice of a single most-preferred option, these effects disappear.

The authors hypothesize that this effect is due to low versus high levels of IC triggering distinct psychological motives. Low IC activates the motive to self-enhance, and communicating positive information is typically more instrumental to this motive than communicating negative information. In contrast, high IC activates the motive to protect others, and communicating negative information is typically more instrumental to this motive than communicating positive information.

Computer Interfaces and the “Direct-Touch” Effect: Can iPads Increase the Choice of Hedonic Food?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0563,01-Oct-16,01-Oct,2016,53,5,745,758,"People are able to order food using a variety of computer devices, such as desktops, laptops, and mobile phones. Even in restaurants, patrons can place orders on computer screens. Can the interface that consumers use affect their choice of food? The authors focus on the “direct-touch” aspect of touch interfaces, whereby users can touch the screen in an interactive manner. In a series of five studies, they show that a touch interface, such as that provided by an iPad, compared with a nontouch interface, such as that of a desktop computer with a mouse, facilitates the choice of an affect-laden alternative over a cognitively superior one—what the authors call the “direct-touch effect.” The studies provide some mediational support that the direct-touch effect is driven by the enhanced mental simulation of product interaction with the more affective choice alternative on touch interfaces. The authors also test the moderator of this effect. Using multiple product pairs as stimuli, the authors obtain consistent results, which have rich theoretical and managerial implications.","Hao Shen, Meng Zhang, Aradhna Krishna","computer interfaces, mental simulation, sensory marketing, embodied cognition, food choice",28,,,,
Keeping the American Dream Alive: The Interactive Effect of Perceived Economic Mobility and Materialism on Impulsive Spending,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0053,01-Oct-16,01-Oct,2016,53,5,759,772,"This research illustrates how perceived economic mobility moderates the linkage between materialism and impulsive spending. Using various data sources, four studies show that materialistic consumers do not easily engage in impulsive spending when they perceive high economic mobility, whereas they tend to spend impulsively when they perceive low economic mobility. However, perceived economic mobility functions in the opposite manner when the purchase is a means to achieve financial success. The authors trace this effect to the self-regulation process of materialistic consumers, such that when perceiving high economic mobility, these consumers regulate their behavior toward long-term financial success, sacrificing the pleasure of acquisitions in the present. By elucidating the important role that perceived economic mobility plays in impulsive spending, the current research sheds new light on consumer research and offers managerial and public policy implications.","Sunyee Yoon, Hyeongmin Christian Kim","perceived economic mobility, materialism, impulsive spending, self-regulation, self-control",13,,,,
The Modern Advertising Agency Selection Contest: A Case for Stipends to New Participants,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0347,01-Oct-16,01-Oct,2016,53,5,773,789,"In the modern advertising agency selection contest, each participating agency specifies not only its proposed creative campaign but also the budget required to purchase the agreed-on media. The advertiser selects the agency that offers the best combination of creative quality and media cost, similar to conducting a score auction. To participate in the contest, each agency needs to incur an up-front bid-preparation cost to cover the development of a customized creative campaign. Agency industry literature has called for the advertiser to fully reimburse such costs to all agencies that enter the contest. The authors analyze the optimal stipend policy of an advertiser facing agencies with asymmetric bid-preparation costs, such that the incumbent agency faces a lower bid-preparation cost than a competitor agency entering the contest. The authors show that reimbursing bid-preparation costs in full is never optimal, nor is reimbursing any part of the incumbent's bid-preparation cost. However, a stipend that is strictly lower than the competitor's bid-preparation cost can benefit the advertiser under certain conditions. The authors provide a sufficient condition (in terms of the distribution of agency values to the advertiser) for such a new-business stipend to benefit the advertiser.","Dan Horsky, Sharon Horsky, Robert Zeithammer","advertising agencies, contests, score auctions",,,,,
Knowing When to Spend: Unintended Financial Consequences of Earmarking to Encourage Savings,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0455,01-Oct-16,01-Oct,2016,53,5,790,803,"Maintaining savings is an important financial goal. Yet there are times when savings should be spent, such as when people face unavoidable costs, and spending their savings allows them to avoid high interest rate debt. Existing behavioral research has focused on consumer decisions between savings and discretionary spending and has proposed interventions to promote savings in these contexts. However, when spending is not discretionary, such interventions could risk exacerbating a pattern found in economic research in which people borrow high interest rate debt while maintaining savings that earn low levels of interest. To examine how mental accounting interacts with considerations of personal responsibility and guilt to contribute to this pattern, this article explores whether people spend their savings when they need money most: during emergencies. Six studies reveal that people's tendency to preserve savings by borrowing from a high interest rate credit option varies as a function of the savings’ intended use. Paradoxically, people are most likely to turn to high interest rate credit with the belief that doing so is the responsible option.","Abigail B. Sussman, Rourke L.

In this article, the authors investigate information architecture as it applies to consumption in retirement. Specifically, in three experiments, they examine how people react to lump sums versus equivalent streams of monthly income. Their primary question of interest is whether people exhibit more or less sensitivity to changes in retirement wealth expressed as lump sums (e.g., $100,000) or monthly equivalents (e.g., $500 per month for life). They also test whether people exhibit an “illusion of wealth,” by which lump sums seem more adequate than monthly amounts in certain conditions, as well as the opposite effect, in which lump sums seem less adequate. They conclude by discussing how format-dependent perceptions of wealth can affect policy and consumers’ financial decision making.","Daniel G. Goldstein, Hal E.

A series of studies shows that this strategic allocation of resources occurs in two ways. Consumers experiencing stress may show increased saving behavior, which assures them that monetary resources will be available when needed. Alternatively, consumers experiencing stress may show increased spending behavior, directed specifically toward products that the consumer perceives to be necessities and that allow for control in an otherwise uncontrollable environment. This conceptualization and the related findings can inform assessments of when stress will lead to beneficial or impulsive consumer behaviors.","Kristina M.

In eight studies, comprising 11,508 participants making 2,423 donation decisions in both experimental settings and a large-scale natural field experiment, the authors investigate the effect of “choice-option” defaults on the donation rate, average donation amount, and the resulting revenue. They find (1) a “scale-back” effect, in which low defaults reduce average donation amounts; (2) a “lower-bar” effect, in which defaulting a low amount increases donation rate; and (3) a “default-distraction” effect, in which introducing any defaults reduces the effect of other cues, such as positive charity information. Contrary to the view that setting defaults will backfire, defaults increased revenue in the field study. However, the findings suggest that defaults can sometimes be a “self-canceling” intervention, with countervailing effects of default option magnitude on decisions and resulting in no net effect on revenue.

In five experiments, the authors ask U.S. and French adults and children to imagine vividly the taste, smell, and texture of three hedonic foods before choosing a portion size of another hedonic food. Compared with a control condition, this “multisensory imagery” intervention led hungry and nondieting people to choose smaller food portions, and they anticipated greater eating enjoyment and were willing to pay more for them. This occurred because multisensory imagery prompted participants to evaluate portions on the basis of expected sensory pleasure, which peaks with smaller portions, rather than hunger. In contrast, health-based interventions led people to choose a smaller portion than the one they expected to enjoy most—a hedonic cost for them and an economic cost for food marketers.","Yann Cornil, Pierre Chandon","food consumption, health, portion size, nutrition, mental imagery",179,,,,

Consumer advocates have proposed that disclosing how defaults are intended to influence choices could help protect consumers from being unknowingly manipulated. This research shows that consumers appreciate transparency, but disclosure does not make defaults less influential. Seven experiments demonstrate that disclosure alters how fair consumers perceive defaults to be but does not attenuate default effects because consumers do not understand how to counter the processes by which defaults bias their judgment. Given that defaults lead consumers to focus disproportionately on reasons to choose the default even with disclosure, debiasing default effects requires that consumers engage in a more balanced consideration of the default and its alternative. Encouraging people to articulate their preferences for the default or its alternative, as in a forced choice, shifts the focus away from the default and reduces default effects.","Mary Steffel, Elanor F.

He finds that ads increase the chances of sales for nonadvertised restaurants significantly. The spillover benefits are concentrated on restaurants that serve the advertiser's cuisine and have a high rating on the restaurant-search website. The extent of spillovers also depends on the intensity of the advertising effort. The spillovers are largest when the intensity (frequency) of advertising is low. As the intensity increases, the spillovers disappear and the advertiser gains more sales. These patterns are consistent with the following mechanism: ads increase the chance of consumers buying the advertised product but also remind consumers of similar (nonadvertised) options. Higher ad intensity leads to a stronger direct effect favoring the advertiser and can offset the spillover caused by the broader reminder.",Navdeep S.

Analyses based on 488 elasticities drawn from 83 studies reveal a mean elasticity of .04 for advertising expenditure variables and of .54 for marketing asset variables. Among marketing assets, customer-related assets show a higher mean elasticity of .72, compared with .33 for brand-related assets. Further analyses show that advertising elasticities are lower in more concentrated industries and that marketing asset elasticities are higher during recession times.

The experiments show that upfront ads, which instantly convey what they promote, are evaluated positively after brief but also after longer exposure durations. Mystery ads, which suspend conveying what they promote, are evaluated negatively after brief but positively after longer exposure durations. False front ads, which initially convey another identity than what they promote, are evaluated positively after brief exposures but negatively after longer exposure durations.

Reasoning that decisions taken in response to analyst forecasts involve discretionary budgets, the authors study four contingent conditions under which quarterly analyst forecasts drive unanticipated adjustments to advertising and R&D budgets, and the long-term consequences of these budgetary changes. The choice of contingent conditions is related to agency theory–driven concepts of monitoring and bonding costs. Results from a panel data set of 515 firms and a hierarchical Bayesian model that provides firm-level coefficients show that both artificially imposed incentives on managers (monitoring costs) and personal career management concerns (bonding costs) moderate the extent to which managers react to analyst forecasts. Specifically, (1) bonus versus equity proportion of CEO compensation enhances the likelihood of managers reacting to analyst forecasts with unanticipated decreases in advertising and R&D budgets; (2) output experience of CEOs decreases this likelihood; (3) throughput experience of CEOs increases this likelihood; and (4) increasing marketing and R&D intensity decreases this likelihood.

Five studies show that people sensibly expect others to like similar products, but erroneously expect others to dislike dissimilar ones. While people readily select dissimilar items for themselves (particularly if the dissimilar item is of higher quality than a similar one), they fail to predict this choice for others—even when monetary rewards are at stake.

An empirically validated agent-based model simulates the U.S. motion picture market, with new movies launching, competing, and exiting. The agent-based model serves as a means to demonstrate the essential role of shared consumption for explaining movie life cycles and tests how advertising expenditures accelerate and/or acquire movies’ demand in markets with varying levels of shared consumption.

A second study, focusing only on plural structure alliances, shows that horizontal relationship factors (i.e., market overlap and prior relationship between downstream partners) interact with the upstream firm's greater alliance experience and reputation to lead to better returns for the upstream firm.","Eric (ER) Fang, Jongkuk Lee, Robert Palmatier,...","marketing alliance, plural structure, dyadic structure, interfirm relationships, dependence balancing",,,,,

An analysis of alliance networks in the consumer packaged goods industry from 1990 to 2010 shows that a central position in a global network represents a double-edged sword: it improves a firm's incremental new product launches but harms its breakthrough new product launches. Furthermore, a firm's ego network (manifested as density and diversity) and R&D capability enable it to leverage its global network position by enhancing the benefits for incremental new products and mitigating its hazards for breakthrough new products.

For example, marketers may prefer to highlight a brand's membership in the top 10 tier of a third-party list instead of disclosing the brand's exact rank. The authors propose that when marketers use these types of imprecise advertising claims, subtle differences in the selection of a tier boundary (e.g., top 9 vs. top 10) can influence consumers’ evaluations and willingness to pay. Specifically, the authors find a comfort tier effect in which a weaker claim that references a less exclusive but commonly used tier boundary can actually lead to higher brand evaluations than a stronger claim that references a more exclusive but less common tier boundary. This effect is attributed to a two-stage process by which consumers evaluate imprecise rank claims. The results demonstrate that consumers have specific expectations for how messages are constructed in marketing communications and may make negative inferences about a brand when these expectations are violated, thus attenuating the positive effect such claims might otherwise have on consumer responses.","Mathew S.

The first study, a secondary data analysis, finds that longer delays between placing an order and picking up the meal are associated with reductions in calorie content. The second study tests the causality of this relationship by exogenously restricting some lunch orders to be substantially delayed, leading to a marginally significant (approximately 5%) reduction in calories among delayed orders. The third study compares orders for truly immediate consumption versus orders placed in advance and demonstrates a significant (100 calorie, or approximately 10%) reduction in lunch calories.

Walking in My Shoes: How Expectations of Role Reversal in Future Negotiations Affect Present Behaviors,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0426,01-Jun-16,01-Jun,2016,53,3,381,395,"The authors focus on repeated distributive negotiations to investigate how expectations of role reversal in future transactions (i.e., a buyer [seller] in one transaction is the seller [buyer] in the next transaction) affect behaviors in the current negotiation. They demonstrate that when negotiators expect a role reversal, they are likely to make more concessions and reach agreement more quickly in the current negotiation. The authors find that this effect is driven by negotiators’ beliefs that they will be able to recover these concessions, because negotiators expect their counterparts to reciprocate in the later transaction when the parties reverse roles. However, when the two negotiations occur in different “accounting” periods (i.e., fiscal periods) or when the negotiating parties do not explicitly communicate their willingness to reverse roles in the future, role-reversal expectations do not affect concession making. Implications arise in both managerial and consumer contexts where the possibility of engaging in future negotiations—as well as reversing roles—exists.","Rajesh Bagchi, Nevena T.

Productivity Metrics and Consumers’ Misunderstanding of Time Savings,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0229,01-Jun-16,01-Jun,2016,53,3,396,406,"The marketplace is replete with productivity metrics that put units of output in the numerator and one unit of time in the denominator (e.g., megabits per second [Mbps] to measure download speed). In this article, three studies examine how productivity metrics influence consumer decision making. Many consumers have incorrect intuitions about the impact of productivity increases on time savings: they do not sufficiently realize that productivity increases at the high end of the productivity range (e.g., from 40 to 50 Mbps) imply smaller time savings than productivity increases at the low end of the productivity range (e.g., from 10 to 20 Mbps). Consequently, the availability of productivity metrics increases willingness to pay for products and services that offer higher productivity levels. This tendency is smaller when consumers receive additional information about time savings through product experience or through metrics that are linearly related to time savings. Consumers’ intuitions about time savings are also more accurate when they estimate time savings than when they rank them. Estimates are based less on absolute than on proportional changes in productivity (and proportional changes correspond more with actual time savings).","Bart De Langhe, Stefano Puntoni","time perception, numeracy, productivity, efficiency, heuristics and biases",25,,,,
Price Transparency and Retail Prices: Evidence from Fuel Price Signs in the Italian Highway System,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0411,01-Jun-16,01-Jun,2016,53,3,407,423,"Price transparency initiatives are typically undertaken by third parties to ensure that consumers can compare the prices of competing offers in markets in which obtaining such information is costly. Such practices have recently become widespread, yet it is unclear whether the increased price competition due to lower search costs overcomes the potential for collusion between competitors due to lower price coordination costs. Motivated by this question, the authors investigate the effect of mandatory price posting (on large electronic signs) on the pricing behavior of competing gas stations in the Italian highway system. The authors find that when prices are posted, the average price of gasoline decreases by 1 euro cent per liter, which represents about 20% of stations’ margins. About half the price decrease can be attributed to the introduction of a sign posting a station's own price and those of its nearest neighbors, with the other half due to the introduction of other signs posting the prices of other stations on the same road. Despite the price reduction, however, the introduction of signs seems to have little impact on price dispersion, suggesting that price uncertainty persists even after the policy is implemented. Analysis of customer transaction data confirms this finding, showing that less than 10% of consumers use the posted price information effectively.","Federico Rossi, Pradeep K.

“Yes/No/Not Right Now”: Yes/No Response Formats Can Increase Response Rates Even in Non-Forced-Choice Settings,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0227,01-Jun-16,01-Jun,2016,53,3,424,432,"Although yes/no response formats have been used to increase enrollment rates in several different types of programs, their effectiveness has generally been tested in forced-choice settings.

The increase in click-through rate does, under certain conditions, also persist through downstream program enrollment and participation. Finally, though noting that the yes/no format advantage is probably multidetermined, the authors discuss several potential psychological mechanisms, which are particularly relevant in non-forced-choice settings.

Does Sparing the Rod Spoil the Child? How Praising, Scolding, and an Assertive Tone Can Encourage Desired Behaviors,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0224,01-Jun-16,01-Jun,2016,53,3,433,441,"In search of effective ways to encourage consumers to follow desired behaviors such as healthy eating, recycling, or financial planning, marketers sometimes use praise (e.g., “You are doing great”) and sometimes use scolding (e.g., “You are not doing enough”). However, the effectiveness of each approach in triggering behavior is not clear. A possible reason for the mixed results in this area is that it is not only what one says that matters but also how one says it: praising and scolding can be performed with a more or less assertive tone. This research introduces assertiveness as a moderator that can explain when praising or scolding would be more effective. Two field experiments in the context of hand hygiene and financial planning demonstrate that when communicators praise consumers, an assertive tone may be more effective in encouraging behavior, whereas scolding requires a nonassertive tone. The authors then replicate these field findings in a controlled laboratory experiment, which also provides click rates as an actual behavioral outcome.","Amir Grinstein, Ann Kronrod","field experiment, prosocial, praise, scold, assertive",13,,
Exploring the Differences between Conscious and Unconscious Goal Pursuit,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0263,01-Jun-16,01-Jun,2016,53,3,442,458,"People can be aware (conscious) or unaware (unconscious) of an active goal when making a choice. Being aware of a goal enables people to use conscious strategies to identify attributes that are relevant to goal pursuit and to assess the efficacy of the attributes of each choice alternative. For most people, this process encourages the choice of the most goal-consistent alternative. For some people, this process encourages the consideration of trade-offs, activates a competing goal, and encourages the choice of a goal-inconsistent alternative. With unconscious goal pursuit, people cannot devote resources to assessing the efficacy of the attributes of each alternative; therefore, they match the accessible goal to the attributes of the available alternatives. As a result, the unconscious selects an alternative with attributes that are consistent with the goal and not necessarily the alternative that is most efficacious for the goal. The authors investigate these processes by manipulating the conscious system's ability to assess the efficacy of product attributes and the unconscious system's ability to match the accessible goal to product attributes.","Juliano Laran, Chris Janiszewski, Anthony Salerno","unconscious goal pursuit, conscious goal pursuit, accessibility, elaboration, choice",7,,,,
Halo (Spillover) Effects in Social Media: Do Product Recalls of One Brand Hurt or Help Rival Brands?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0009,01-Apr-16,01-Apr,2016,53,2,143,160,"Online chatter is important because it is spontaneous, passionate, information rich, granular, and live. Thus, it can forewarn and be diagnostic about potential problems with automobile models, known as nameplates. The authors define “perverse halo” (or negative spillover) as the phenomenon whereby negative chatter about one nameplate increases negative chatter for another nameplate. The authors test the existence of such a perverse halo for 48 nameplates from four different brands during a series of automobile recalls. The analysis is by individual and panel vector autoregressive models. The study finds that perverse halo is extensive. It occurs for nameplates within the same brand across segments and across brands within segments. It is strongest between brands of the same country. Perverse halo is asymmetric, being stronger from a dominant brand to a less dominant brand than vice versa. Apology advertising about recalls has harmful effects on both the recalled brand and its rivals. Furthermore, these halo effects affect downstream performance metrics such as sales and stock market performance. Online chatter amplifies the negative effect of recalls on downstream sales by about 4.5 times.","Abhishek Borah, Gerard J.

Homogeneous Contracts for Heterogeneous Agents: Aligning Sales Force Composition and Compensation,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0018,01-Apr-16,01-Apr,2016,53,2,161,182,"Observed contracts in the real world are often very simple, which partly reflects the constraints faced by contracting firms in making the contracts more complex. In this article, the authors focus on one such rigidity: the constraints faced by firms in fine-tuning contracts to the full distribution of heterogeneity of their employees. The authors explore the implication of these constraints for the provision of incentives within the firm. The study's application is to sales force compensation, wherein a firm maintains a sales force to market its products. Consistent with ubiquitous real-world business practice, the study assumes that a firm is restricted to fully or partially set uniform commissions across its agent pool. The authors show that this restriction implies an interaction between the composition of agent types in the contract and the compensation policy used to motivate them, leading to a “contractual externality” in the firm and generating gains to sorting. This article explains how this contractual externality arises; discusses a practical approach to endogenizing agents and incentives at a firm in its presence; and presents an empirical application to sales force compensation contracts at a U.S. Fortune 500 company that explores these considerations and assesses the gains from a sales force architecture that sorts agents into divisions to balance firmwide incentives. Empirically, the authors find that the restriction to homogeneous plans significantly reduces a firm's payoff, relative to a fully heterogeneous plan, when the firm is unable to optimize the composition of its agents. However, a firm's payoff under a homogeneous plan comes very close to that under a fully heterogeneous plan when the firm can optimize both composition and compensation. Thus, in the empirical setting of this study, the ability to choose agents mitigates the loss in incentives from the restriction to uniform contracts. The authors conjecture this result may hold more broadly.","Øystein Daljord, Sanjog Misra, Harikesh S. Nair","sales force compensation, incentives, hiring, agency theory, dynamics",,,,,
The Influence of Serotonin Deficiency on Choice Deferral and the Compromise Effect,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0482,01-Apr-16,01-Apr,2016,53,2,183,198,"Psychological and physiological states such as mood, hunger, stress, and sleep deprivation are known to affect decision-making processes and therefore crucially influence consumer behavior. A possible biological mechanism underlying the observed variability of consumer behavior is the context-sensitive variation in the levels of neuromodulators in the brain. In a series of four experimental studies, the authors pharmaceutically reduce the levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain to diminish the availability of subjects’ cognitive resources. In doing so, they study how serotonin brain levels influence (1) subjects’ tendency to avoid buying and (2) consumers' preference for product options positioned as a compromise in a given choice set rather than for more extreme alternatives (i.e., the compromise effect). Using realistic product choice scenarios in a binding decision framework, they find that a reduction of brain serotonin levels leads to choice deferral and decreases the compromise effect, both as a within-subjects and as a between-subjects choice phenomenon. As such, this study provides neurobiological evidence for the assumption that the compromise effect is the result of deliberate and demanding thought processes rather than intuitive decision making.","Marcel Lichters, Claudia Brunnlieb, Gideon Nave,...","choice deferral, compromise effect, real payments, serotonin, tryptophan depletion",8,,,,
Can Sales Uncertainty Increase Firm Profits?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0506,01-Apr-16,01-Apr,2016,53,2,199,206,"The authors add to the sales management literature in three ways. First, they demonstrate that a firm can benefit from higher sales uncertainty. This is contrary to the finding from the standard principal–agent models that more sales uncertainty hurts the firm when agents are risk-averse. Second, the authors find that the risk-averse agent's total pay can increase when there is high sales uncertainty, and this too is contrary to the standard principal–agent model. Third, they provide intuition for this surprising result by showing that it holds when the slope of the sales response function is random but not when the intercept is random. When the responsiveness (slope) of sales to a decision variable (of the firm or the agent) is random, information about randomness becomes decision-relevant and the firm can exploit learned information. In this study's model, the agent and firm can receive noisy signals of random demand. When the customers’ response to effort (or price) is random, the decision about effort (price) responds optimally to information in a way that benefits the firm. When uncertainty is high, there is more potential information for the firm to exploit profitably, owing to the convexity of the sales with respect to the uncertainty parameter. This is enough to dominate the negative impact of uncertainty owing to agents’ risk aversion. When randomness affects only baseline sales (intercept), received signals are not decision-relevant. In that case, higher uncertainty has only a negative impact, just as in standard principal–agent models.","Niladri Syam, James D.

Advertising Effectiveness: The Moderating Effect of Firm Strategy,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0285,01-Apr-16,01-Apr,2016,53,2,207,224,"Advertising's influence on firm sales and firm value has drawn early attention from economists and accountants and more recent attention from marketers. Most studies that have investigated a link between advertising and sales have found such a link. However, studies that have investigated a link between advertising and firm value have only sometimes found that link. Meta-analysis has failed to determine moderators that govern the link between advertising and firm value. In this article, the authors hypothesize that advertising influences firm value for a differentiator because advertising can elaborate the firm's point of difference into brand equity, thereby building firm value. Advertising cannot build brand equity for a cost leader because such a firm has no point of difference on which to build. Identifying differentiators and cost leaders on the basis of firms’ reactions to a change in accounting regulations, the authors confirm hypotheses: advertising is related to sales for all firms, but it is more strongly related to firm value for differentiators than for cost leaders. Beyond explaining differences in advertising effectiveness, this study's indicator of differentiation versus cost leadership should enhance future analyses of marketing's effect on firm-level outcomes using archival financial data.","Leigh McAlister, Raji Srinivasan, Niket Jindal,...","advertising, differentiation, cost leadership, sales, firm value",1,,,,

The results also provide insights into how interpersonal characteristics influence WOM outcomes.

Consumer Preferences for Annuity Attributes: Beyond Net Present Value,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0004,01-Apr-16,01-Apr,2016,53,2,240,262,"Decisions about life annuities are an important part of consumer decumulation of retirement assets, yet they are relatively underexplored by marketing researchers studying consumer financial decision making. In this article, the authors propose and estimate a model of individual preferences for life annuity attributes using a choice-based stated-preference survey. Annuities are presented in terms of consumer-relevant attributes such as monthly income, yearly adjustments, period certain guarantees, and company financial strength. The authors find that these attributes directly influence consumer preferences beyond their impact on the annuity's expected present value. The strength of the direct influence depends on how annuities are described: when annuities are represented only through basic attributes, consumers undervalue inflation protection, and preferences are not monotonically increasing in duration of period certain guarantees. When descriptions of annuities are enriched with cumulative payment information, consumers no longer undervalue inflation protection, but nonlinear preferences for period certain options remain. The authors find that among annuities with the same expected payout but different annual increases and period certain guarantees, the proportion of consumers who choose the annuity over self-management can vary by more than a factor of 2.","Suzanne B.

Lower Connectivity is Better: The Effects of Network Structure on Redundancy of Ideas and Customer Innovativeness in Interdependent Ideation Tasks,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0127,01-Apr-16,01-Apr,2016,53,2,263,279,"This article examines the popular marketing practice of interdependent ideation, whereby firms solicit ideas from customers through online platforms that enable customers to be exposed to or “inspired” by other customers’ ideas when generating their own. Although being exposed to others’ ideas means that customers are “connected” (at least implicitly) in a communication network that facilities the flow of ideas, the effect of network structure on individual innovativeness has not been considered in this context. The authors examine how, when, and why network structure—specifically, the clustering, or interconnectivity, of one's “inspirations” (other customers)—affects the innovativeness of individual customers’ product/service ideas in ideation tasks. Across five experiments, the authors show that (1) higher clustering/interconnectivity negatively affects the innovativeness of a customer's ideas; (2) this effect occurs because idea inspirations are more likely to be similar or redundant when their sources (i.e., other customers to which one is connected) are clustered; (3) greater redundancy among ideas used as inspirations is what causes lower innovativeness; and (4) this effect is attenuated when customers do not rely on other customers’ ideas for inspiration.","Andrew T.

In contrast, the brand-community literature suggests community strategies may reduce the likelihood of community members helping non–community members. If so, strategies that promote third party–hosted brand or product-category communities may be counterproductive in fostering C2C helping. Should firms focus on promoting brand communities, promoting product-category communities, or both?

Alternative focus gradually shifts attention toward options that represent promising choices, whereas attribute focus directs attention to important attributes that are most likely to alter or confirm a decision. Alternative and attribute focus increase in intensity with practice. In terms of biases, the authors detect a small but consistent focus on positive aspects of the item chosen and negative aspects of the items not chosen. They also show that incidental exposures arising from the first-examined alternative or from alternatives in a central horizontal location increase attention but have a much more modest and often insignificant impact on conjoint choices.

Is A 70% Forecast more Accurate than a 30% Forecast?

The authors demonstrate that when forecasts are higher versus lower (e.g., a 70% vs. 30% chance of team A winning a game), consumers infer that the forecaster is more confident in his or her prediction, has conducted more in-depth analyses, and is more trustworthy. Consumers also judge the prediction as more accurate. This occurs because people tend to evaluate forecasts on the basis of how well they predict a target event occurring (e.g., team A winning). Higher forecasts indicate greater likelihood of the target event occurring and signal a confident analyst, while lower forecasts indicate lower likelihood and lower confidence in the target event occurring. Yet because with lower forecasts, consumers still focus on the target event (rather than its complement), lower confidence in the target event occurring is erroneously interpreted as the forecaster being less confident in his or her overall prediction (instead of more confident in the complementary event occurring, i.e., team A losing).

One reason behind this type of retention campaign is that customers who subscribe to a plan suitable for them should be less likely to churn because they derive greater benefits from the service. In this article, the authors examine the effectiveness of such retention campaigns using a large-scale field experiment in which some customers are offered plan recommendations and some are not. They find that being proactive and encouraging customers to switch to cost-minimizing plans can, surprisingly, increase rather than decrease customer churn: whereas only 6% of customers in the control condition churned during the three months following the intervention, 10% did so in the treatment group. The authors propose two explanations for how the campaign increased churn, namely, (1) by lowering customers’ inertia to switch plans and (2) by increasing the salience of past-usage patterns among potential churners. The data provide support for both explanations. By leveraging the richness of their field experiment, the authors assess the impact of targeted encouragement campaigns on customer behavior and firm revenues and derive recommendations for service firms.","Eva Ascarza, Raghuram Iyengar, Martin Schleicher","churn/retention, field experiment, pricing, tariff/plan choice, targeting",35,,,,

In this study, the authors draw on signaling theory to develop and empirically test a cross-validation argument. They argue that how a firm treats one stakeholder group will be interpreted by investors in conjunction with how the firm treats another stakeholder group. Investors use consistency in stakeholder group treatment as a signal of complementarity in a firm's investments, which can improve the likelihood of competitive advantage. Specifically, the authors propose that a firm's achievements (lapses) directed at customers have a stronger positive (negative) impact on investors’ valuation of the firm if they are validated by the firm's achievements (lapses) directed at employees, and vice versa. Applying a multilevel model to a large sample of firms across various industries between 1994 and 2010, the authors find evidence to support these arguments. In addition, they find that cross-validation is more crucial for firms with a narrow than a broad business scope.","Christopher Groening, Vikas Mittal, Yan “Anthea” Zhang","signaling theory, achievements/lapses, business scope, stakeholder",32,,,,

Less varied usage experiences make consumers think that products are used more frequently. As a result, perceiving usage experiences as less varied makes consumers more satisfied with their purchase, more likely to buy it again, and more likely to recommend it.

When Do Consumers Avoid Imperfections?

The authors extend work on contagion to show that superficial packaging damage can act as a contamination cue, automatically activating thoughts of contamination and health and safety concerns. This tendency to avoid superficial packaging damage can be eliminated by counteracting these thoughts of contamination. This can be done with positive brand associations (i.e., by branding the product as organic) or by creating a physical buffer between the packaging damage and the product itself.

The Effect of Fitness Branding on Restrained Eaters’ Food Consumption and Postconsumption Physical Activity,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0429,01-Feb-16,01-Feb,2016,53,1,124,138,"People who want to control their body weight often aim to regulate both energy intake (by reducing food consumption) and energy expenditure (by increasing physical activity), thus addressing both sides of the energy balance equation. Marketers have developed fitness-branded food that may lead restrained eaters (i.e., consumers who are chronically concerned about their body weight) to believe that they can achieve these two goals at the same time by consuming the food. The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of fitness branding in food marketing (i.e., the integration of fitness into the branding of food) on consumption and physical activity in restrained (vs. unrestrained) eaters. The authors show that fitness branding increases consumption volumes for restrained eaters unless consumers view the food as dietary forbidden. Restrained eaters are also less physically active after consuming fitness-branded food, and food consumption volumes mediate this effect in restrained eaters. Fitness branding may therefore have undesirable effects on the weight-control behaviors of restrained eaters because it discourages physical activity despite an increase in consumption, which is contrary to the principle of energy balance.","Joerg Koenigstorfer, Hans Baumgartner","dietary restraint, food consumption, fitness, physical activity",118,,,,

Quantifying Under- and Overreporting in Surveys through a Dual-Questioning-Technique Design,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0336,01-Dec-15,01-Dec,2015,52,6,737,753,"In recent years, marketing researchers have become increasingly interested in under- and overreporting. However, there are few suitable approaches to operationalize deviations from the truth, particularly in behavioral domains in which self-reports are usually the only viable method of choice to measure behavior or attitudes. An especially difficult situation arises if some people underreport while others overreport. This article proposes a Bayesian item response theory model to quantify under- and overreporting in surveys. The method utilizes within-person differences between answers obtained under direct questioning (no privacy protection) and randomized-response questioning (which ensures item-level privacy protection). This method has the important features of incorporating behavioral response-mode effects (e.g., privacy loss when switching from direct to randomized-response questioning, response-mode inertia effects) and allowing the direction of bias to differ across respondents. The authors provide an empirical application for excessive alcohol consumption involving 1,408 respondents from a commercial web panel. The results show that respondents are averse to decreases in privacy and that randomized response is less effective if respondents provide biased responses to earlier direct questions.","Martijn G.

Multitier Store Brands and Channel Profits,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0308,01-Dec-15,01-Dec,2015,52,6,754,767,"Multitier store brands are increasing in significance in retail outlets. In this article, the authors theoretically examine the rationale for the existence of multitier store brands, their optimal quality levels, and their implications for consumer welfare and channel profits. They show that despite the manufacturer's efforts to deter the entry of store brands by providing side payments and/or introducing additional national brands, the retailer will offer multitier store brands in equilibrium. Furthermore, the quality levels of store brands and national brands are interlaced, with a store brand taking the top-quality position unless national brands outnumber store brands. Even though the proliferation of store brands reduces product differentiation, it does not decrease consumer welfare or channel profits. However, store brands hurt the manufacturer's profits and make two-part tariffs ineffective in improving channel coordination. Nonetheless, the retailer can enhance channel coordination by procuring the store brand from the national brand manufacturer. The authors extend their model in several directions to capture additional features of retail markets and assess the robustness of their findings.","Wilfred Amaldoss, Woochoel Shin","multitier store brands, store brand quality, pricing power, channel coordination, vertical differentiation",,,,,

Dividing these tasks into smaller parts and completing the parts from smallest size to largest size can help people realize quick motivational gains that increase their likelihood of completing the task. The authors more broadly define this idea as “small victories” and discuss, model, and empirically examine two related behavioral theories that might explain it. A laboratory experiment tests this prediction and provides data for model calibration. Consistent with the idea of small victories, when a task is broken down into parts of unequal size, participants perform faster when the parts are arranged in ascending order (i.e., from smallest to largest) rather than descending order (i.e., from largest to smallest). The calibrated model is consistent with the directional predictions of each theory. However, when participants are given choice over orderings, they choose the ascending ordering least often. The authors conclude with a discussion of the efficacy of this method in stylized debt-repayment scenarios.","Alexander L. Brown, Joanna N.

Likewise, the impact on brand performance after the PW, when prices are restored, is unclear. The authors use a natural-experiment approach to track brand sales and shares before, during, and after a long-lasting supermarket PW in the Dutch grocery market. They find that PWs are not truly revenue, sales, or share generators for most brands unless prices remain reduced permanently by the retailer. Only after the PW, when rivals’ prices are restored and the focal brand's reduced retail price is maintained, can substantial sales, revenues, and share gains be realized. Moreover, restoring prices without additional price promotion support can severely damage brands’ performance. Overall, national brands can gain share, sales, and revenue, but at the cost of not restoring regular prices, while private labels can benefit even when prices are restored after the PW ends.","Francesca Sotgiu, Katrijn Gielens","retailing, price wars, retailer–supplier relationships, consumer packaged goods",,,,,

This article investigates the effect of the degree of competition on the extent to which firms invest in behaving according to the rules of the marketplace. The authors model investments in following these rules as increasing the firm's marginal costs of production and decreasing its probability of being caught violating the market rules (and thus losing profits). They show that greater competition leads to smaller investments in following the market rules. This leads to (1) the existence of a social optimum degree of competition that is less than perfect competition and (2) more competition in general, thus prompting greater optimal monitoring efforts. Stricter market rules can lead to greater investments in satisfying the market rules and to lower production. The authors also present results on the likelihood of firms having broken the market rules depending on relative market shares, optimal monitoring, and the effect of dynamics on the incentives to satisfy the market rules.","Fernando Branco, J.

Using a large-scale quasi experiment and panel data across eight product categories for more than 535,000 members of a grocery chain's frequent shopper program, the authors demonstrate that the point-of-sale nutrition scoring system helped consumers make healthier food choices, such that they switched to higher-scoring products in the postrollout period. The results also reveal that shoppers became less price sensitive and more promotion sensitive following the introduction of the food scoring system.

Transaction Attributes and Customer Valuation,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0377,01-Dec-15,01-Dec,2015,52,6,848,864,"Dynamic customer targeting is a common task for marketers actively managing customer relationships. Such efforts can be guided by insight into the return on investment from marketing interventions, which can be derived as the increase in the present value of a customer's expected future transactions. Using the popular latent attrition framework, one could estimate this value by manipulating the levels of a set of nonstationary covariates. The authors propose such a model that incorporates transaction-specific attributes and maintains standard assumptions of unobserved heterogeneity. They demonstrate how firms can approximate an upper bound on the appropriate amount to invest in retaining a customer and demonstrate that this amount depends on customers’ past purchase activity—namely, the recency and frequency of past customer purchases. Using data from a business-to-business service provider as their empirical application, the authors apply the model to estimate the revenue the service provider loses when it fails to deliver a customer's requested level of service. They also show that the lost revenue is larger than the corresponding expected gain that would result from exceeding a customer's requested level of service.

They find that, on average, rebranding results in approximately a 6.31% increase in occupancy rates; 60% of this effect can be attributed to the brand identities (e.g., Holiday Inn) before and after rebranding while the remaining 40% is attributable to the interaction effect. The authors also find heterogeneity in the property–brand interaction effect of rebranding along various observable characteristics of the hotels. They assess the robustness of the results to various model assumptions and alternative instruments; in addition, they use matching estimators for analysis and exploit rebranding as a consequence of hotel mergers as a means of measuring rebranding effects. Finally, the authors consider the impact that rebranding might have on competitors’ properties.

Using a data set containing the shirt sponsorships from 43 English football clubs between 1990 and 2010, the authors' estimates suggest assortative matching between a club's attendance and a sponsor's revenue. In addition, sponsorships become less valuable as the distance between the club and the sponsor's head office grows, particularly for low-performing clubs and smaller domestic sponsors. The authors use these estimates to simulate the consequences of banning alcohol and gambling sponsors. Their estimates of counterfactual outcomes suggest that such bans may not have the largest impact on the clubs (particularly the relatively successful clubs) that currently have alcohol and gambling sponsors. Instead, clubs with low attendance and clubs in low-income areas will be most affected by a ban. More generally, the results demonstrate that when marketing relationships are viewed as the result of a matching process, actions that affect only some marketers may have substantial indirect effects on a variety of players in the market.","Yupin Yang, Avi Goldfarb","sponsorships, advertising regulation, matching markets, sports marketing, equilibrium outcomes",10,,,,

The results indicate that consumers show diminishing returns to active firm engagement, which, at very high levels, can undermine consumer sentiment. Further subgroup analyses by conversation type indicate that these relationships hold for conversations that address consumers' functional needs but do not hold for conversations that address social needs.

It captures not only the short- and long-term effects of objective service performance on PSQ but also the differential effects of service crises versus service restoration. The authors analyze a unique data set from a major European railway company, spanning seven years of monthly observations. During this period, severe winter weather caused dramatic service crises. The authors find that performance losses loom larger than gains in the short run and also have permanent negative effects on PSQ in the long run. Consequently, a crisis followed by a restoration will result in a net negative long-term effect on PSQ. The impact of a crisis also depends on the prior trend in objective service performance.","Maarten J. Gijsenberg, Harald J. Van Heerde, Peter C.

Feeling Love and Doing More for Distant Others: Specific Positive Emotions Differentially Affect Prosocial Consumption,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0219,01-Oct-15,01-Oct,2015,52,5,657,673,"Marketers often employ a variety of positive emotions to encourage consumption or promote a particular behavior (e.g., buying, donating, recycling) to benefit an organization or cause. The authors show that specific positive emotions do not universally increase prosocial behavior but, rather, encourage different types of prosocial behavior. Four studies show that whereas positive emotions (i.e., love, hope, pride, and compassion) all induce prosocial behavior toward close entities (relative to a neutral emotional state), only love induces prosocial behavior toward distant others and international organizations. Love's effect is driven by a distinct form of broadening, characterized by extending feelings of social connection and the boundary of caring to be more inclusive of others regardless of relatedness. Love—as a trait and a momentary emotion—is unique among positive emotions in fostering connectedness that other positive emotions (hope and pride) do not and broadening behavior in a way that other connected emotions (compassion) do not. This research contributes to the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotion by demonstrating a distinct type of broadening for love and adds an important qualification to the general finding that positive emotions uniformly encourage prosocial behavior.","Lisa A.

Using data covering a Dutch supermarket price war (2003–2005), the authors find that price reductions, especially deep reductions, trigger media coverage of the price conflict. This sets off a chain of reactions. Press messages have a significant effect on market share and abnormal stock returns, beyond retailers' own price and advertising. Importantly, this study uncovers striking asymmetries regarding the kind of coverage to which stakeholders react: whereas consumers only respond to the tone of price-related press coverage, retailers and investors only react to its quantity. Next, media coverage feeds back into the retailers' pricing actions: more media coverage triggers new price cuts in addition to those dictated by competitive reactions. As such, media coverage triggers a deeper spiral of price cuts, intensifying the competitive price battle. However, as the price war progresses, media coverage becomes less frequent and less favorable, which decelerates the downward price spiral.","Harald J.

This tension is expected to produce a unique pattern of innovation strategies among firms going public, causing such firms to increase their innovation levels but reduce their innovation riskiness. Specifically, the authors predict that after going public, firms innovate at higher levels and introduce higher levels of variety with each innovation; however, these innovations are less risky, characterized by fewer breakthrough innovations and fewer innovations in new-to-the-firm categories. The authors compare 40,000 product introductions in the period 1980–2011 from a sample of consumer packaged goods firms that went public with a benchmark sample of firms that remained private, and the results support their predictions. Utilizing tests to resolve questions about endogeneity, including self-selection, reverse causality, and competing explanations, the authors demonstrate that initial public offering selection and dynamics do not drive this going-public effect.

Almost 144,000 m-coupons were delivered during the trial, representing 38 stores that supplied 134 different coupons.

How long the m-coupons are valid (expiry length) is also important because redemption times for m-coupons are much shorter than for traditional coupons.

The analysis is based on a randomized field experiment in which mobile promotions were sent to customers at three similar shopping areas (competitive, focal, and benchmark locations). The results show that competitive locational targeting can take advantage of heightened demand that a focal retailer would not otherwise capture. Competitive locational targeting produced increasing returns to promotional discount depth, whereas targeting the focal location produced decreasing returns to deep discounts, indicating saturation effects and profit cannibalization. These findings are important for marketers, who can use competitive locational targeting to generate incremental sales without cannibalizing profits.

These measures have been shown to reliably tap into higher-level constructs commonly used in advertising research: attention, affect, memory, and desirability. Using time-series data on sales and gross rating points, the authors attempt to relate individual-level response to television ads in the lab to the ads’ aggregate, market-level elasticities.

That is, as opposed to being constructed through reflective processes, brand personality traits seem to exist a priori inside consumers’ minds, such that the authors are able to predict what brand a person is thinking about solely on the basis of the relationship between brand personality associations and brain activity.

During functional magnetic resonance imaging, the price of a product was shown to participants either before or after the product itself was presented. Early exposure to price, or “price primacy,” altered the process of valuation, as observed in altered patterns of activity in the medial prefrontal cortex immediately before making a purchase decision. Specifically, whereas viewing products first resulted in evaluations strongly related to products’ attractiveness or desirability, viewing prices first appeared to promote overall evaluations related to products’ monetary worth. Consistent with this framework, the authors show that price primacy can increase purchase of bargain-priced products when their worth is easily recognized. Together, these results suggest that price primacy highlights considerations of product worth and can thereby influence purchasing.","Uma R.

They use a novel automated structural brain imaging approach to determine individual differences and combine this approach with traditional behavioral experiments.

Using EEG to Predict Consumers’ Future Choices,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0564,01-Aug-15,01-Aug,2015,52,4,511,529,"It is well established that neural imaging technology can predict preferences for consumer products. However, the applicability of this method to consumer marketing research remains uncertain, partly because of the expense required. In this article, the authors demonstrate that neural measurements made with a relatively low-cost and widely available measurement method—electroencephalography (EEG)—can predict future choices of consumer products. In the experiment, participants viewed individual consumer products in isolation, without making any actual choices, while their neural activity was measured with EEG. At the end of the experiment, participants were offered choices between pairs of the same products. The authors find that neural activity measured from a midfrontal electrode displays an increase in the N200 component and a weaker theta band power that correlates with a more preferred product. Using recent techniques for relating neural measurements to choice prediction, they demonstrate that these measures predict subsequent choices. Moreover, the accuracy of prediction depends on both the ordinal and cardinal distance of the EEG data; the larger the difference in EEG activity between two products, the better the predictive accuracy.","Ariel Telpaz, Ryan Webb, Dino J.

Dissimilar brain responses occurred in the Together but not the Alone condition for the P2 and P3 components over visual cortex sites. The LPP amplitude was higher for luxury than for basic branded products, but only in the Together condition, suggesting that the presence of another person magnifies the emotional effect of brand type. Taken together, the results suggest that LPP amplitude during passive viewing of relevant marketing images reflects increased attention allocation and motivational significance, both enhanced by the presence of another person, to stimuli with higher emotional value.","Rumen Pozharliev, Willem J.M.I.

Innovation locus, however, does not have an effect on incrementally new innovations. The positive effect of peripheral locus (relative to core locus) for RNIs occurs through four mechanisms: (1) reduced schema incongruity, (2) lower risk perceptions, (3) increased benefit understanding, and (4) greater perceived usage flexibility associated with the new product. The authors demonstrate these effects by using stimuli from four product categories and including both attitudinal and behavioral measures of innovation adoption.

Strategic firms’ efforts to capitalize on their loyal customers’ higher willingness to pay increases nonstrategic firms’ share of price-sensitive consumers. Furthermore, by raising prices, strategic firms help their nonstrategic counterparts more than themselves.

Contrary to this, the authors find that when the budget contracts to a particular level, consumers select less variety (as measured by the number of different items with some of the budget allocated to them) than when their budget expands to that same level. This budget contraction effect stems from a reduction in variety under the contracting budget, not from variety expansion under the expanding budget.

New sellers tend to outbid existing sellers in the mature stage, but the opposite is true when the service is newly introduced (launch stage). Because existing sellers can more effectively send quality signals in the launch stage, attracting existing, rather than new, sellers has a greater effect on click rate in the launch stage; however, the opposite is true in the mature stage. Attracting new buyers also has a greater effect on click rate and price, especially in the mature stage.

At traditional supermarkets, consumers anchor and elaborate on prices of storable categories bought in large quantities and for which quality differentiation is high. For hard discounters, however, SPI is mostly shaped by frequently bought categories with narrow assortments. Notably, categories’ SPI signaling power is not proportional to their share of wallet at either type of chain. Managers can use these results to identify “Lighthouse” categories that signal low prices, yet make up a small portion of store spending, and in which price cuts do not overly hurt revenue.","Carlos J.S.

Second, managers’ self-referential tendencies increase with empathy because taking a consumer perspective activates managers’ private consumer identity and, thus, their personal consumption preferences. Third, empathic managers’ self-referential preference predictions make them less likely to use market research results. Fourth, the findings imply that when explicitly instructed to do so, managers are capable of suppressing their private consumer identity in the process of perspective taking, which helps them reduce self-referential preference predictions.

However, recent research has suggested that satisfactory product return experiences can actually benefit firms by lowering the customer's perceived risk of current and future purchases. To better understand the role of this perceived risk in the firm–customer exchange process, the authors conduct a large-scale customer selection and optimal resource allocation field experiment with 26,000 customers from an online retailer over six months. They find that the firm is able to increase both its short-and long-term profits when accounting for the perceived risk related to product returns in addition to managing product return costs.

They posit that this phenomenon occurs because referencing a hedonic product during a charitable appeal changes the self-attributions, or self-signaling utility, associated with the choice to donate. A series of hypothetical and actual choice experiments demonstrate the predicted effect and show that the increase in donation rates occurs because the self-attributions signaled by a choice not to donate are more negative in the context of a hedonic reference product.

Novel features in the authors’ model include consumers’ ability to anticipate the media's incentives for slant and the requirement that all media stances must be supported by facts. Furthermore, consumers find reports with more facts to be more convincing. Despite consumers’ ability to detect slant and their demand for factual support, the research shows that competition results in consumers reading fewer facts and being unable to update their prior beliefs about the state of the world. The authors also find that a monopoly medium may be more polarizing than competitive media and that polarized reporting can be less biased.","Yi Zhu, Anthony Dukes","factual content, media bias, media competition, information goods, cheap talk",,,,,
Inequity Aversion and Fair Selling,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0175,01-Feb-15,01-Feb,2015,52,1,77,89,"This research investigates optimal selling strategies and equilibrium welfare implications in markets with buyer inequity aversion. When buyers care about their surplus relative to seller profits but are uncertain about seller costs, buyers’ fairness perceptions and, thus, their willingness to pay may be malleable and susceptible to seller influence. If a seller's optimal behavior (e.g., pricing) is not completely unvarying in variable costs, buyers can rationally make inferences about seller costs from observed seller behavior. Consequently, buyers’ fairness perceptions and their willingness to pay can influence, and be influenced by, optimal selling strategies. The study characterizes a fair selling equilibrium in which optimal seller behavior and buyer perceived fairness are interactively derived. The author shows that seller ex ante profit may increase as more buyers become inequity averse. In addition, buyer ex ante surplus can be nonmonotonically influenced by an increase in the number of fair-minded buyers or in the degree of inequity aversion. These counterintuitive results pinpoint the importance of investigating the strategic interaction between buyer fairness perceptions and selling strategies. Finally, the basic model is extended to examine how the fair selling equilibrium may be influenced by cost disclosure, buyer dynamic learning, and seller competition.",Liang Guo,"behavioral economics, distributional fairness, inequity aversion, reference price, pricing",,,,,
The Braggart's Dilemma: On the Social Rewards and Penalties of Advertising Prosocial Behavior,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0002,01-Feb-15,01-Feb,2015,52,1,90,104,"People often brag about, or advertise, their good deeds to others. Seven studies investigate how bragging about prosocial behavior affects perceived generosity. The authors propose that bragging conveys information about an actor's good deeds, leading to an attribution of generosity. However, bragging also signals a selfish motivation (a desire for credit) that undermines the attribution of generosity. Thus, bragging has a positive effect when prosocial behavior is unknown because it informs others that an actor has behaved generously. However, bragging does not help—and often hurts—when prosocial behavior is already known, because it signals a selfish motive. In addition, the authors demonstrate that conspicuous cause marketing products have effects akin to bragging by signaling an impure motive for doing good deeds. Finally, the authors argue that bragging about prosocial behavior is unique because it undermines the precise information that the braggart is trying to convey (generosity). In contrast, bragging about personal achievements does not affect perceptions of the focal trait conveyed in the brag. These findings underscore the strategic considerations inherent in signaling altruism.","Jonathan Z. Berman, Emma E.

This research provides a framework for how consumers can become more mindful of their food choices. To do so, the authors develop an ability-based training program to strengthen people's ability to focus on goal-relevant emotional information. They demonstrate not only that emotional ability (EA) is trainable and that food choices can be enhanced (Study 1) but also that EA training improves food choices beyond a nutrition knowledge training program (Study 2). In Study 3, the authors test a conceptual model and find that EA training increases goal-relevant emotional thoughts and reduces reliance on the unhealthy = tasty intuition. Both factors mediate mindful eating effects. Last, Study 4 demonstrates the long-term benefits of EA training by showing that emotionally trained people lose more weight in a three-month period than a control group and a nutrition knowledge training group. Together, these findings suggest that consumers can gain control of their food choices through the enhancement of EA.

As such, consumers who perceive themselves to be physically “high” or elevated are more likely to adopt a global perceptual processing and higher level of conceptual construal, whereas those who perceive themselves to be physically “low” are more likely to adopt a local perceptual processing and lower level of conceptual construal. This difference in construal level also affects product choices that involve trade-offs between long-term benefits and short-term effort. The authors address alternative accounts such as vertical distance, visual distance, and perceived power.

Through lab and field studies, the authors demonstrate that highlighting a large competitor's size and close proximity can help smaller brands rather than harm them. The results show that support for small brands goes up when faced with a competitive threat from large brands versus when they are in competition with brands that are similar to them or when consumers view them outside a competitive context. This support translates into purchase intentions, real purchases, and more favorable online reviews in a study of more than 10,000 Yelp posts.

The authors' premise is that such a narrow focus does not capture the complete impact of brand imitation. They offer a broader, theory-based perspective of harm by proposing that brand imitation affects both brand consideration and preference in the consumer choice process. The authors establish a formal nexus between brand consideration and the legal doctrine “initial interest confusion.” Using choice experiments and statistical modeling, they show that brand imitation harms the imitated brand even after controlling for brand confusion. Moreover, brand imitation harms not only the imitated brand but also other national brands in the category that are not being imitated. To quantify brand consideration and preference harm in financial terms, the authors propose two metrics: choice share shift and share-equalizing price cut. The results show that brand imitation harms the national brand more when the imitating brand is not associated with a well-known retailer and that brand imitation harm extends beyond brand confusion. The proposed framework provides both legal and managerial guidance.","Anocha Aribarg, Neeraj Arora, Ty Henderson,...","trade dress infringement, brand confusion, brand equity, private label, brand similarity",,,,,

Executives value being associated with strong brands and, therefore, accept substantially lower pay at firms that own strong brands. Consistent with identity theory, this effect is stronger for chief executive officers and younger executives than for other executives.

As a remedy for this dilemma, the current research introduces the customization via starting solutions (CvSS) architecture, which substantially reduces the complexity of product customization while preserving all of its advantages. Under CvSS, consumers first select one starting solution from a set of prespecified products, which they then refine to create their final customized product. Evidence from nine studies (three of which were conducted in field settings) across a wide range of product domains (shirts, cars, vacation packages, jewelry, and financial products) shows that the CvSS architecture results in substantial benefits relative to the standard attribute-by-attribute product customization format for both consumers (increased satisfaction with their product choices, reduced choice complexity, and enhanced mental simulation of product use) and firms (purchases of more feature-rich, and thus higher-priced, products).","Christian Hildebrand, Gerald Häubl, Andreas Herrmann","product customization, consumer decision making, choice architecture, field experiments",14,,,,

This article examines the mechanisms underlying out-of-phase versus in-phase schedules and empirically demonstrates their sales and revenue implications in four product categories, covering purchases of a national panel of households across eight years. The results reveal that calendar effects primarily materialize in categories in which the chosen retailer is driven by brand promotions. In those categories, alternating the timing of featured price cuts across chains substantially increases the manufacturer and retailers' immediate sales lift. However, with regard to net gains, striving for out-of-phase promotions—the dominant approach among chains—is not necessarily the best practice, because retailers observe the revenue advantage diminish, and manufacturers may even earn less.","Jonne Y.

A field experiment shows that a 75% contingent match (such that matches “kick in” only if 75% of others donate) is most effective in increasing commitment to recurring donations. An online experiment reveals that the 75% contingent match drives commitment to recurring donations because it simultaneously provides social proof while offering a low enough target to remain plausible that the match will occur. A final online experiment demonstrates that the effectiveness of the 75% contingent match extends to one-time donations.

The analysis considers how these advertising expenditures translate directly into sales, as well as indirectly through intermediate search advertising metrics—namely, impressions and click-through rate. For a high-end clothing and apparel retailer, the authors find that cross effects exist and are important and that cross-effect elasticities are almost as high as own-effect elasticities. Online display and, in particular, search advertising is more effective than traditional advertising. This result is primarily due to strong cross effects on the offline channel. Return-on-investment calculations suggest that by ignoring these cross effects, firms substantially miscalculate the effectiveness of online advertising.

The authors extend traditional brand–message recall measurements to facilitate comparisons between Internet formats and television by supplementing brand–message surveys conducted during the campaign with a set of precampaign surveys to control for preexisting brand knowledge. They find that accounting for differences in preexisting brand knowledge is paramount in obtaining valid comparisons across advertising formats because people who are exposed to Internet display ads have significantly lower levels of preexisting brand knowledge than television viewers. Without considering the differences in these “initial conditions,” television advertising seems to be more effective than advertising on the Internet, but when the preexisting differences among media formats are taken into account, the brand recall lift measures for Internet ads are statistically indistinguishable from comparable television lift measures.","Michaela Draganska, Wesley R.

Meanwhile, pay-per-impression (PPI) schemes persist, and several publishers have begun to offer a hybrid mix of PPI and P4P schemes. Given the proliferation of pricing schemes, this study examines the optimal choices for publishers. The authors highlight two-sided information asymmetries in online advertising markets and the consequent trade-offs faced by a high-quality publisher using P4P schemes. Pay-for-performance schemes enable a high-quality publisher to reveal its superior quality; however, such schemes may incur allocative inefficiencies stemming from inaccurate estimates of advertiser qualities. The authors identify conditions under which a publisher may opt for a PPI, P4P, or hybrid scheme and, in doing so, provide theoretical explanations for the observed variations in the pricing schemes and the increasing popularity of hybrid schemes. Using a new “uncompromised” equilibrium refinement, the authors find that the hybrid scheme can emerge as an equilibrium choice in a variety of conditions. In addition, they provide prescriptive guidelines for firms choosing between different pricing schemes.","De Liu, Siva Viswanathan","online advertising, pay for performance, information asymmetry, hybrid pricing",,,,,

Bearing in mind that this research is a first exploratory attempt to illuminate the role of marketing for new venture funding using correlational secondary data, the results indicate that CMO education, marketing experience, and industry experience are positively related to the likelihood of funding.

The results show that the inferences marketing researchers obtain from monitoring social media are dependent on where they “listen” and that common approaches that either focus on a single social media venue or ignore differences across venues in aggregated data can lead to misleading brand sentiment metrics. The authors validate the approach by comparing their model-based measure of brand sentiment with performance measures obtained from external data sets (stock prices for both brands and an offline brand-tracking study for one brand).

Such information had greater influence on subsequent judgments (e.g., of the next day's weather, of the hotel's quality) than identical information not framed as a first.

The present research demonstrates conditions under which consumers exhibit similar behaviors to dissociative out-group members in the domain of positive consumption behaviors. In particular, when a consumer learns that a dissociative out-group performs comparatively well on a positive behavior, the consumer is more likely to respond with positive intentions and actions when the setting is public (vs. private). The authors suggest that this occurs because learning of the successful performance of a dissociative out-group under public conditions threatens the consumer's group image and activates the desire to present the group image in a positive light. The authors show that although group affirmation mitigates these effects, self-affirmation does not. They also examine the moderating role of the positivity of the behavior and the mediating role of group image motives. Taken together, the results highlight conditions under which communicating information about the behaviors of dissociative out-groups can be used to spur consumers to engage in positive actions.","Katherine White, Bonnie Simpson, Jennifer J.

A Joint Examination of Quality Choice and Satisfaction: The Impact of Circumstantial Variables,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0139,01-Aug-14,01-Aug,2014,51,4,448,462,"Using data from an online hotel reservation site, the authors jointly examine consumers’ quality choice decision at the time of purchase and subsequent satisfaction with the hotel stay. They identify three circumstantial variables at the time of purchase that are likely to influence both the choice decisions and the postpurchase satisfaction: the time gap between purchase and consumption, distance between purchase and consumption, and time of purchase (business/nonbusiness hours). The authors incorporate these three circumstantial variables into a formal two-stage economic model and find that consumers who travel farther and make reservations during business hours are more likely to select higher-quality hotels but are less satisfied. Consumers who book earlier are more likely to select higher-quality hotels and are more satisfied. The findings suggest that incorporating circumstantial variables into formal choice models is useful in helping managers understand and predict consumer choices and satisfaction assessments.","Wei Zhang, Ajay Kalra","two-stage choice models, satisfaction, psychological distance, prospective accounting, resource depletion",52,,,,
Mining Marketing Meaning from Online Chatter: Strategic Brand Analysis of Big Data Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0106,01-Aug-14,01-Aug,2014,51,4,463,479,"Online chatter, or user-generated content, constitutes an excellent emerging source for marketers to mine meaning at a high temporal frequency. This article posits that this meaning consists of extracting the key latent dimensions of consumer satisfaction with quality and ascertaining the valence, labels, validity, importance, dynamics, and heterogeneity of those dimensions. The authors propose a unified framework for this purpose using unsupervised latent Dirichlet allocation. The sample of user-generated content consists of rich data on product reviews across 15 firms in five markets over four years. The results suggest that a few dimensions with good face validity and external validity are enough to capture quality. Dynamic analysis enables marketers to track dimensions’ importance over time and allows for dynamic mapping of competitive brand positions on those dimensions over time. For vertically differentiated markets (e.g., mobile phones, computers), objective dimensions dominate and are similar across markets, heterogeneity is low across dimensions, and stability is high over time. For horizontally differentiated markets (e.g., shoes, toys), subjective dimensions dominate but vary across markets, heterogeneity is high across dimensions, and stability is low over time.","Seshadri Tirunillai, Gerard J.

Using a data set of individual-level click activity after keyword searches from a leading search engine in Korea, the authors find that consumers’ click activity after a keyword search is low and heavily concentrated on the organic list. However, searches of less popular keywords (i.e., keywords with lower search volume) are associated with more clicks per search and a larger fraction of sponsored clicks. This indicates that, compared with more popular keywords, consumers who search for less popular keywords expend more effort in their search for information and are closer to a purchase, which makes them more targetable for sponsored search advertising.","Kinshuk Jerath, Liye Ma, Young-Hoon Park","sponsored search advertising, organic search listing, click-through behavior, keyword search volume",26,,,,

In nearly all such cases, the unattractive dominated option enhances the attractiveness of the option it most resembles—a phenomenon known as the “attraction effect.” In the studies presented here, however, the authors contend that this phenomenon may be restricted to stylized product representations in which every product dimension is represented by a number (e.g., a toaster oven that has a durability rating of 7.2 and ease of cleaning rating of 5.5). Such effects do not typically occur when consumers experience the product (e.g., taste a drink) or when even one of the product attributes is represented perceptually (e.g., differently priced hotel rooms whose quality is depicted with a photo). The authors posit that perceptual representations of attributes do not support the sorts of comparisons that drive the attraction effect with highly stylized examples, and they question the practical significance of the effect.","Shane Frederick, Leonard Lee, Ernest Baskin","attraction effect, context effects, attribute representation, consumer choice, asymmetric dominance",18,,,,

Vices and Virtues of Misguided Replications: The Case of Asymmetric Dominance,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0093,01-Aug-14,01-Aug,2014,51,4,514,519,"The likelihood of replicating an effect such as asymmetric dominance (AD) largely depends on other, usually more important choice drivers (e.g., attributes, values). Accordingly, it is not surprising that the AD effect is often not observed when other choice drivers have greater impact and/or when the AD configuration is unlikely to be perceived. However, when price is an attribute (and in many other cases), the AD effect is often observed in both properly designed studies and the real world. The author notes that Frederick, Lee, and Baskin (2014) raise important questions, but they would have made a greater contribution had they (1) systematically studied the drivers of AD perceptions, (2) more accurately tried to replicate previous AD effect demonstrations, and (3) systematically studied the repulsion effect.

In this commentary, the authors first ground the attraction (asymmetric dominance) effect in its historical context as a test of an important theoretical assumption from rational choice theory. Drawing on the research reported by scholars from many fields of study, the authors argue that the finding of an asymmetric dominance effect remains robust because it holds when the conditions of the study are essentially replicated. Next, the authors identify some of the factors that mitigate (and amplify) the attraction effect and then position the effect into a larger theoretical debate involving the extent to which preferences are constructed versus merely revealed. The authors conclude by arguing that researchers who try to measure values as well as choice architects who attempt to shape values must be sensitive to the context-dependent properties of choice behavior, as illustrated by the attraction effect.","Joel Huber, John W.

Reviews without a Purchase: Low Ratings, Loyal Customers, and Deception,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0209,01-Jun-14,01-Jun,2014,51,3,249,269,"The authors document that approximately 5% of product reviews on a large private label retailer's website are submitted by customers with no record of ever purchasing the product they are reviewing. These reviews are significantly more negative than other reviews. They are also less likely to contain expressions describing the fit or feel of the items and more likely to contain linguistic cues associated with deception. More than 12,000 of the firm's best customers have written reviews without confirmed transactions. On average, these customers have each made more than 150 purchases from the firm. This makes it unlikely that the reviews were written by the employees or agents of a competitor and suggests that deceptive reviews may not be limited to the strategic actions of firms. Instead, the phenomenon may be far more prevalent, extending to individual customers who have no financial incentive to influence product ratings.","Eric T. Anderson, Duncan I.

Which Products Are Best Suited to Mobile Advertising? A Field Study of Mobile Display Advertising Effects on Consumer Attitudes and Intentions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0503,01-Jun-14,01-Jun,2014,51,3,270,285,"Mobile advertising is one of the fastest-growing advertising formats. In 2013, global spending on mobile advertising was approximately $16.7 billion, and it is expected to exceed $62.8 billion by 2017. The most prevalent type of mobile advertising is mobile display advertising (MDA), which takes the form of banners on mobile web pages and in mobile applications. This article examines which product characteristics are likely to be associated with MDA campaigns that are effective in increasing consumers’ (1) favorable attitudes toward products and (2) purchase intentions. Data from a large-scale test-control field experiment covering 54 U.S. MDA campaigns that ran between 2007 and 2010 and involved 39,946 consumers show that MDA campaigns significantly increased consumers’ favorable attitudes and purchase intentions only when the campaigns advertised products that were higher (vs. lower) involvement and utilitarian (vs. hedonic). The authors explain this finding using established theories of information processing and persuasion and suggest that when MDAs work effectively, they do so by triggering consumers to recall and process previously stored product information.","Yakov Bart, Andrew T.

Six studies demonstrate that compared with narrowcasting (i.e., communicating with just one person), broadcasting (i.e., communicating with multiple people) leads consumers to avoid sharing content that makes them look bad. Narrowcasting, however, encourages people to share content that is useful to the message recipient. These effects are driven by communicators’ focus of attention. People naturally tend to focus on the self, but communicating with just one person heightens other-focus, which leads communicators to share less self-presenting content and more useful content. These findings shed light on the drivers of word of mouth and provide insight into when the communication sender (vs. receiver) plays a relatively larger role in what people share.","Alixandra Barasch, Jonah Berger","word of mouth, self-presentation, self-focus, other-focus, audience size",19,,,,

Consequently, most advertising response models have focused directly on sales and ignored other purchase funnel activities. The authors demonstrate, in the context of the U.S. automotive market, how consumer online search volume data from Google Trends can be combined with sales data to decompose advertising's overall impact into two underlying components: its impacts on (1) generating consumer interest in prepurchase information search and (2) converting that interest into sales. The authors show that this decompositional approach, implemented through a novel state-space model that simultaneously examines sales and search volumes, offers important advantages over a benchmark model that considers sales data alone. First, the approach improves goodness-of-fit, both in and out of sample. Second, it improves diagnosticity by distinguishing advertising effectiveness in interest generation from its effectiveness in interest conversion.

When Do Group Incentives for Salespeople Work?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0322,01-Jun-14,01-Jun,2014,51,3,320,334,"When should sales managers employ group incentives rather than individual incentives to motivate their sales force? Using economic experiments, the authors show that two-person group incentives can outperform individual incentives and that the relative efficacy of group incentives depends on three important factors. First, the strength of social ties among the group members matters. Effort decisions in group-based incentives increase significantly when members socialize briefly before committing effort. Second, the design of the group incentive matters. For the group incentive to work better than the individual incentive, the group-based component (i.e., how much the payment scheme weights the contribution of others) in the former cannot be too large. Third, the informational feedback that group members receive matters. When socialized group members can observe one another's true effort, rather than only their output, effort surprisingly decreases. The authors show that a model that accounts for social preferences and the psychological loss that occurs when teammates underestimate one's effort can explain salesperson behavior in group incentives well.","Noah Lim, Hua Chen","sales management, group incentives, experimental economics, behavioral economics",7,,,,
PIE: A Holistic Preference Concept and Measurement Model,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0406,01-Jun-14,01-Jun,2014,51,3,335,351,"Extant preference measurement research, including conjoint analysis, has been silent on the explicit influence of others in the formation of consumer preferences. This article proposes a new holistic framework of preference, “PIE,” as well as a measurement method to remedy this problem. The new paradigm posits that consumers evaluate products on the basis of different “needs” determined by three sources: (1) P, the physical attributes of the product; (2) I, the individual characteristics of the choice maker; and (3) E, characteristics of an external peer group. To provide an empirically feasible method to capture all three sources of information, the authors propose and test an incentive-aligned approach, a “group-sourced mechanism,” which mimics a consumer's real-life consultation in the presence of his or her friends when making a purchase decision. The results provide support for the PIE framework, including superior predictive performance in a conjoint task that is “stacked against it.” The authors also show how firms can apply the PIE framework for product design. Practitioners, however, must carefully weigh the benefits of the group-sourced preference measurement with the heavier cognitive burden on the respondents in completing the task.","Hye-Jin Kim, Young-Hoon Park, Eric T.

Shopper Loyalty to Whom?

This distinction is important in a dynamic retail environment: if a store changes ownership, chain loyalty makes customers inclined to seek out another outlet of the former chain, whereas outlet loyalty enhances their stay rate after the takeover. This article distinguishes the two forms of loyalty conceptually and discusses how both can be identified empirically in a model of consumers’ reactions to store acquisitions. The authors estimate their model on unique scanner panel data covering ±200 local markets and takeovers. The results confirm that after an acquisition, consumers exhibit outlet loyalty, regardless of changes in chain and marketing mix. Counterfactual simulations point to important managerial implications. Acquiring outlets with a clientele in place leads to higher store traffic levels than the new owner could otherwise reach. Notably, these benefits cannot be reaped if the acquiring chain is a hard discounter, in which case customers’ previous store knowledge is less relevant, and incentives to seek out new outlets are greater.","Arjen Van Lin, Els Gijsbrechts","store acquisitions, state dependence, choice models, outlet loyalty, takeovers, store choice",,,,,

In this article, the authors take a different approach to this topic by demonstrating how beliefs in contagion (the notion that objects may acquire a special aura or “essence” from their past) influence perceptions of authenticity for everyday consumer products and brands. Specifically, they find that due to a belief in contagion, products from a company's original manufacturing location are viewed as containing the essence of the brand. In turn, this belief in transferred essence leads consumers to view products from the original factory as more authentic and valuable than identical products made elsewhere. The authors further reveal that consumers who are higher in sensitivity to contagion are more likely to exhibit this effect and that activating the concept of contagion enhances preferences for products made in the brand's original factory. The authors close by discussing theoretical and practical implications of these findings.","George E.

Importantly, positive shifts in advertising spending during the economic contraction predict better subsequent business performance. The opposing roles of the intelligence and responsiveness facets disappear in a subsequent economic expansion period. These findings have managerial and theoretical implications.

The authors propose that higher prices set higher expectations, which serve as reference points. When expectations are met or exceeded, we observe the familiar P–Q relationship. However, when price is high and quality is relatively low, the product falls short of consumers’ reference point and the P–Q relationship is reversed; thus, people evaluate a low-quality product with a high price more negatively than a low-quality product with a low price.

The authors attribute this finding to an urge to take advantage of a rare consumption opportunity, which leads people to pay less attention to the quantity consumed and subsequently to experience less satiation. A series of studies establish the effect of perceived limited availability on the rate of satiation, show that it influences how much people eat, provide mediation evidence of the proposed theoretical account, and eliminate the effect by making salient the total amount consumed.

Second, a perceptual decision task (triangle test) assesses the accuracy and speed with which consumers can identify differences between brands from rapidly (300 milliseconds) flashed images of their packages. Third, a competing accumulator model describes the buildup of evidence on each of the alternative brands during consumers’ perceptual decisions and predicts the accuracy and response time of brand identification. Jointly, these components establish the impact of copycat packaging's visual features on consumer confusion. The method is applied in a test of experimentally designed copycats and market copycats in 15 product categories.

Attributing Conversions in a Multichannel Online Marketing Environment: An Empirical Model and a Field Experiment,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0050,01-Feb-14,01-Feb,2014,51,1,40,56,"Technology enables a firm to produce a granular record of every touchpoint consumers make in their online purchase journey before they convert at the firm's website. However, firms still depend on aggregate measures to guide their marketing investments in multiple online channels (e.g., display, paid search, referral, e-mail). This article introduces a methodology to attribute the incremental value of each marketing channel in an online environment using individual-level data of customers’ touches. The authors propose a measurement model to analyze customers’ (1) consideration of online channels, (2) visits through these channels over time, and (3) subsequent purchases at the website to estimate the carryover and spillover effects of prior touches at both the visit and purchase stages. The authors use the estimated carryover and spillover effects to attribute the conversion credit to different channels and find that these channels’ relative contributions are significantly different from those found by other currently used metrics. A field study validates the proposed model's ability to estimate the incremental impact of a channel on conversions. In targeting customers with different patterns of touches in their purchase funnel, these estimates help identify cases in which retargeting strategies may actually decrease conversion probabilities.","Hongshuang (Alice) Li, P.K.

The Completeness Heuristic: Product Shape Completeness Influences Size Perceptions, Preference, and Consumption,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0153,01-Feb-14,01-Feb,2014,51,1,57,68,"This research demonstrates the effect of the completeness of a product's shape on size perceptions, preference, and consumption quantities. The authors show that people estimate an incompletely shaped product to be smaller and, therefore, prefer it less in general than a completely shaped one of equal size and weight. They also find that the reduced size estimations for incompletely shaped products lead to increased consumption quantities of this type of item. Finally, the authors demonstrate that the “completeness heuristic” operates even when the incompletely shaped item has a larger primary dimension than its completely shaped counterpart.","Julio Sevilla, Barbara E.

Across four studies (including a field study involving purchase data collected from an online group-buying website), the authors show that when the numbers constitute an approximation sequence or are multiples of one another, deal processing fluency is increased, which influences deal liking and ultimately has an impact on consumers’ price promotion predilection. In addition, this article demonstrates that when consumers are not highly motivated to process numerical information, they may choose deals that offer less economic value but feature a combination of numbers that they can more fluently process.

What may be observable, instead, are aggregate diffusion patterns for past products adopted within a particular social network. The authors propose an approach for identifying systematic conditions that are stable across diffusions and thus are “transferrable” to new product introductions within a given network. Using Facebook applications data, the authors show that incorporation of such systematic conditions improves prelaunch forecasts.

Consistent with this analysis, six experiments indicate that consumers may perceive customized offers that are presented as tailored to their individual preferences or circumstances as less valuable than offers that seem to fit their preferences and provide value without the marketer's explicit intent. The experiments also suggest that the urge to exploit unintended value reflects a competitive desire to outsmart the market.

Asymmetric Roles of Advertising and Marketing Capability in Financial Returns to News: Turning Bad into Good and Good into Great,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0278,01-Dec-13,01-Dec,2013,50,6,706,724,"News reports carrying positive or negative sentiment about a firm influence its stock market performance. This study examines how two firm-controllable marketing factors, advertising and marketing capability, moderate the relationship between news stories and firm stock returns. Analysis of a panel data set of more than 7,000 firm-month observations indicates asymmetric and complementary moderating roles of the two marketing variables: advertising reinforces the favorable impact of positive news on abnormal stock returns, and marketing capability mitigates the adverse impact of negative news. Moreover, these moderating effects operate through different stakeholders. Whereas the moderating effect of marketing capability is due to its influence on customers and thus affects the level and volatility of future cash flows, advertising moderates the effect of news through individual investors’ attention and response to the news. The econometric analysis accounts for potential endogeneity between news reports, stock returns, and marketing variables, and the results are robust to alternative measures and analysis approaches. The findings suggest the need for managers to broaden their stakeholder focus when evaluating advertising's returns and to communicate the value of marketing capability to investors.","Guiyang Xiong, Sundar Bharadwaj","advertising, marketing capability, abnormal stock returns, cash flows, investor attention, news",,,,,
Framing Influences Willingness to Pay but Not Willingness to Accept,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0430,01-Dec-13,01-Dec,2013,50,6,725,738,"The authors show, with real and hypothetical payoffs, that consumers are willing to pay substantially less for a risky prospect when it is called a “lottery ticket,” “raffle,” “coin flip,” or “gamble” than when it is labeled a “gift certificate” or “voucher.” Willingness to accept, in contrast, is not affected by these frames. This differential framing effect is the result of an aversion to bad deals, which causes buyers to focus on different aspects than sellers. Buyers’ willingness to pay is influenced by the extent to which a risky prospect's frame is associated with risk (Experiment 1) as well as the prospect's lowest (but not highest) possible outcome (Experiment 2). Sellers’ willingness to accept, in contrast, is influenced by a prospect's lowest and highest possible outcomes but not by the risk associated with its frame (Experiments 2 and 3). The framing effect on willingness to pay is independent of the objective level of uncertainty (Experiment 4) and can lead to the uncertainty effect.

In support of the authors’ underlying avoidance motivation perspective, these effects are mediated by participants’ net prevention focus and are attenuated when the crowd in question consists of in-group members.

Prominence versus Dominance: How Relationships between Alternatives Drive Decision Strategy and Choice,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0052,01-Dec-13,01-Dec,2013,50,6,753,766,"This article argues that the structure of a choice set can influence the extent to which consumers weight a given attribute. The results of seven experiments suggest that the relationship between options under consideration can influence preference ordering by shifting the decision strategy people adopt when constructing their preference. In decisions in which people afford greater importance to one attribute versus another, preference for an option that scores high on this prominent attribute may decrease when decoy options that are clearly better or worse than the focal options are inserted into the choice set. The authors posit that this effect arises because decision makers initially (and spontaneously) use dominance cues rather than prominence when evaluating options, and they continue to use this strategy even when it does not enable them to differentiate the alternatives under consideration. The authors moderate this effect by prompting respondents to consider prominence and by manipulating the order in which respondents evaluate options in the choice set. This article has theoretical implications for research on context effects, contingent decision behavior, and choice architecture as well as practical implications for product-line management.","Ioannis Evangelidis, Jonathan Levav","dominance, prominence, context effects, attribute, number of alternatives",,,,,

When Does Retargeting Work? Information Specificity in Online Advertising,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0503,01-Oct-13,01-Oct,2013,50,5,561,576,"Firms can now offer personalized recommendations to consumers who return to their website, using consumers' previous browsing history on that website. In addition, online advertising has greatly improved in its use of external browsing data to target Internet ads. Dynamic retargeting integrates these two advances by using information from the browsing history on the firm's website to improve advertising content on external websites. When surfing the Internet, consumers who previously viewed products on the firm's website are shown ads with images of those same products. To examine whether this is more effective than simply showing generic brand ads, the authors use data from a field experiment conducted by an online travel firm. Surprisingly, the data suggest that dynamic retargeted ads are, on average, less effective than their generic equivalents. However, when consumers exhibit browsing behavior that suggests their product preferences have evolved (e.g., visiting review websites), dynamic retargeted ads no longer underperform. One explanation for this finding is that when consumers begin a product search, their preferences are initially construed at a high level. As a result, they respond best to higher-level product information. Only when they have narrowly construed preferences do they respond positively to ads that display detailed product information. This finding suggests that in evaluating how best to reach consumers through ads, managers should be aware of the multistage nature of consumers' decision processes and vary advertising content along these stages.","Anja Lambrecht, Catherine Tucker","retargeting, online advertising, field experiments, online decision process, construal level theory",21,,,,

Relying on agency theory arguments, the authors first assess the influence of the regulatory context, both by itself and in combination with the franchise ownership structure, on the incidence of litigated conflict.

Using a store choice and spending model that explicitly accounts for interstore synergies and multiple-store shopping behavior, the authors study consumer responses to 194 HD openings. Although they find that HDs, like large discounters, especially appeal to private label–prone shoppers and lead to sizable incumbent losses, the results confirm that the nature of these losses is different. First, HDs do not cause incumbent chains to lose their best customers; instead, shoppers who have already visited other chains alongside the incumbent are lost. Second, the authors find that chains located in close proximity to new HDs do not suffer more from their entry. Third, losses are lower for upscale chains and incumbents that strongly complement the HD. The authors conclude by discussing implications for proper response to HD entry.","Mark Vroegrijk, Els Gijsbrechts, Katia Campo","grocery retailing, hard discounters, multiple-store shopping, store entry, competitive response",2,,,,

By moving beyond a dyadic view of punishment, this article considers the effects of punishment on observers and integrates insights from social learning, fairness heuristic, and social network theories. The resulting framework of the observer effects of punishment in a distribution network, empirically tested with a survey in China, reveals two mechanisms through which punishment leads to reduced observer opportunism: (1) a direct deterrence effect and (2) a trust-building process. Moreover, two information-related constructs moderate the observer effects differently. The disciplined distributor's relational embeddedness, which motivates greater information flow to observers, aggravates the problem of information asymmetry against the manufacturer, making punishment less deterrent for observers. In contrast, the manufacturer's monitoring capability, which reduces information asymmetry, strengthens observer effects. The authors discuss both theoretical and managerial implications of using punishment to achieve collaboration from a wide network of channel members.","Danny T. Wang, Flora F.

The survey presents the respondents with potential job offers and yields individual-level estimates of each respondent's indirect utility of a job as a function of location, job status, and salary. The authors use a delayed follow-up choice task to demonstrate stability of the preference estimates both over time and across response modalities. The estimated preferences imply that Chinese doctoral graduates tend to remain in the United States because of a large salary disparity between the two countries rather than because of an inherent preference for locating in the United States.

For this purpose, the authors constructed a unique data set on online and offline WOM and characteristics for more than 600 of the most talked-about U.S. brands. To guide this empirical analysis, they present a theoretical framework arguing that consumers spread WOM on brands as a result of social, emotional, and functional drivers. Using these drivers, the authors identify a set of 13 brand characteristics that stimulate WOM, including three (level of differentiation, excitement, and complexity) that have not been studied to date as WOM antecedents. The authors find that whereas the social and functional drivers are the most important for online WOM, the emotional driver is the most important for offline WOM.

The results reveal several new empirical insights. First, the authors find significant category-level complementarities between planned items and unplanned considerations, which they capture using a latent category map. Second, planned consideration and unplanned consideration differ in key behavioral characteristics (e.g., likelihood of purchase, time of occurrence, number of product touches). Third, greater likelihood of purchase conversion is significantly associated with dynamic factors (e.g., remaining in-store slack, outcome of the previous consideration) and behavioral characteristics (e.g., number of displays viewed, distance to shelf, references to a shopping list).

The authors argue that this is due to differences in causal attributions for positive versus negative information such that positive reviews tend to be relatively more attributed to the reviewer (vs. product experience) than negative reviews. The presence of temporal contiguity cues, which indicate that review writing closely follows consumption, reduces the relative extent to which positive reviews are attributed to the reviewer and mitigates the negativity bias. An examination of 65,531 Yelp.com restaurant reviews shows that review value is negatively related to review valence but that this negative relationship is absent for reviews that contain temporal contiguity cues. A series of lab studies replicates these findings and suggests that temporal contiguity cues enhance the value of a positive review and increase the likelihood of choosing a product with a positive review by changing reader beliefs about the cause of the review.","Zoey Chen, Nicholas H.

They propose that the representation level influences the type of decision criterion that becomes readily available; whether this available criterion is appropriate for comparing the options in turn affects choice difficulty. Four studies demonstrate the proposed effect of representation level on the difficulty of comparable and noncomparable choices and its downstream implications for decision satisfaction.","Eunice Kim Cho, Uzma Khan, Ravi Dhar","choice difficulty, mental representation, choice satisfaction, mindsets, construal, choice comparability",,,,,

Consumer Behavior in “Equilibrium”: How Experiencing Physical Balance Increases Compromise Choice,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0455,01-Aug-13,01-Aug,2013,50,4,535,547,"The authors propose that the physical sensation of balance can affect consumer judgments and decisions. A series of six experiments demonstrates that certain consumer behaviors, such as leaning back in a chair while shopping online, can activate the concept of balance and thereby affect the consumer decision-making process. Specifically, consumers experiencing a heightened sense of balance are more likely to choose compromise options. The authors propose and show evidence for the mechanism underlying these effects: that the concept of balance is metaphorically linked in the mind to the concept of parity and that activating balance increases the accessibility of the parity concept. The increased accessibility of parity changes consumer perceptions of the product offerings in a choice set, increasing the selection of compromise options because they provide parity on the described product attributes.","Jeffrey S.

They propose that the mental representation of a large assortment changes the perceived similarity of the assortment and consequently affects the degree of choice difficulty. Specifically, when choosing from a large assortment, consumers with an abstract representation perceive the options in the assortment as being more similar and accordingly experience less choice difficulty than those with a concrete representation of the assortment.

The BTS mechanism, which mathematically rewards “surprisingly common” answers, both rewarded truth telling, by heavily penalizing foil recognition, and induced truth telling, in that participants who were paid according to their BTS scores claimed to recognize fewer foils than control groups, even when given competing incentives to exaggerate. Survey takers who received BTS-based payments without explanation became less likely to recognize foils as they progressed through the survey, suggesting that they learned to respond to BTS incentives despite the absence of guidance. The mechanism also outperformed the solemn oath, a competing truth-inducement mechanism.

Bonuses versus Commissions: A Field Study,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0485,16-Oct-18,01-Jun,2013,50,3,317,333,"Quota-based bonuses and commissions are the two most common incentive compensation plans. The authors uncover differential effects of these plans from a natural field-based experiment featuring 14,000 monthly observations over three years from 458 sales territories of a pharmaceutical firm that switched from a bonus plan to an equivalent commission plan. The intervention led to significant sales productivity improvement; this effect was heterogeneous across ability deciles, with much larger increases occurring at lower ability deciles. The authors find significant differences across these plans on (1) effort against nonincentivized tasks and (2) output fluctuations induced through “timing games.” At this firm, the bonus plan was strictly inferior to the implemented commission plan with respect to short-term revenues and timing games. In contrast, the commission plan induced greater neglect of nonincentivized tasks (tasks not directly affecting observable output). To organize their findings, the authors build a simple theoretical model in the personnel economics tradition. The novel result that multitasking concerns are reduced under bonus plans when the quota has been met provides a nuanced rationale for the widespread existence of lump-sum bonus plans.","Sunil Kishore, Raghunath Singh Rao, Om Narasimhan,...","sales compensation, field experiments, timing games, multitasking",3,,,,

Grounded in theory on social perception and role congruity, four experiments show that consumer inferences about and behavioral intentions toward conspicuous sellers are moderated by communal and exchange relationship norms. Specifically, conspicuous consumption by a seller decreases warmth inferences and, in turn, behavioral intentions toward the seller under the communal norm; conversely, it increases competence inferences and, in turn, behavioral intentions under the exchange norm. A seller's mere wealth triggers similar inferences, suggesting that conspicuous consumption is a surrogate for actual wealth. Priming consumers with persuasion knowledge inhibits the inferential benefits resulting from conspicuousness under the exchange norm. These findings reveal the theoretically meaningful role of the consumption context by showing that consumers’ warmth and competence inferences operate differentially in commercial relationships as a result of salient communal versus exchange norms, with important consequences for consumers’ behavioral intentions.","Maura L.

Fusing Aggregate and Disaggregate Data with an Application to Multiplatform Media Consumption,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0431,01-Jun-13,01-Jun,2013,50,3,348,364,"As firms collect greater amounts of data about their customers from an ever broader set of “touchpoints,” a new set of methodological challenges arises.

In this article, the authors provide a method that firms can use, based on readily available data, to gauge and monitor multiplatform media usage. The key innovation in the method is a Bayesian data-fusion approach that enables researchers to combine individual-level usage data (readily available for most digital platforms) with aggregated data on usage over time (typically available for traditional platforms). This method enables the authors to disentangle the intraday correlations between platforms (i.e., the usage of one platform vs. another on a given day) from longer-term correlations across users (i.e., heavy/light usage of multiple platforms over time). The authors conclude with a discussion of how this method can be used in a variety of marketing contexts for which data have become readily available, such as gauging the interplay between online and brick-and-mortar purchasing behavior.","Eleanor McDonnell Feit, Pengyuan Wang, Eric T.

The authors test the hypotheses using field data from German and Japanese MNCs in the United States and Bayesian models that account for measurement error, endogeneity in the control mechanisms, heterogeneity in country of origin, and nonlinear and interactive terms for the latent constructs.

The Impact of Brand Rating Dispersion on Firm Value,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0188,01-Jun-13,01-Jun,2013,50,3,399,415,"This study examines brand dispersion—variance in brand ratings across consumers—and its role in the translation of brand assets into firm value. Dispersion captures the covert heterogeneity in brand evaluations among consumers who like or dislike the brands, which would affect an investor's decision to buy or sell a stock. The higher the dispersion, the more inconsistent and polarized the brands’ cross-consumer ratings. Multiple analyses on 730,818 brand–day observations provide robust evidence that brand dispersion fluctuations affect stock prices. Brand dispersion has Januslike effects: it harms returns but reduces firm risk. Furthermore, downside dispersion has a stronger impact on abnormal returns than upside dispersion, indicating an asymmetry in brand dispersion's effects. Moreover, dispersion tempers the risk-reduction benefits of higher brand rating in both the short run and long run. Without modeling dispersion, brand rating's impact on firm value can be over- or underestimated. Managers should consider dispersion a vital brand-management metric and add it to the brand-performance dashboard.","Xueming Luo, Sascha Raithel, Michael A.

Study 2 reveals that preferences for a brand offering a delayed promotion are stronger when consumers have a variety-seeking tendency and that preferences of consumers low (vs. high) in need for cognitive closure are more influenced by the difference in variety-seeking versus inertial tendency.

The authors define a program's “social value” as the global change, over the entire social system, in customer equity that can be attributed to the word-of-mouth program participants. They compute programs’ social value in various scenarios using an agent-based simulation model and empirical connectivity data on 12 social networks in various markets as input to the simulation. The authors show how expansion and acceleration integrate to create programs’ social value and illustrate how the role of each is affected by factors such as competition, program targeting, profit decline, and retention.

Price and Advertising Effectiveness over the Business Cycle,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0414,01-Apr-13,01-Apr,2013,50,2,177,193,"Firms are under increasing pressure to justify their marketing expenditures. This evolution toward greater accountability is reinforced in harsh economic times when marketing budgets are among the first to be reconsidered. To make such decisions, managers must know whether, and to what extent, marketing's effectiveness varies with the economic tide; however, surprisingly little research addresses this issue. Therefore, the authors conduct a systematic investigation of the business cycle's impact on the effectiveness of two important marketing instruments: price and advertising. To do so, they estimate time-varying short- and long-term advertising and price elasticities for 150 brands across 36 consumer packaged goods categories, using 18 years of monthly U.K. data from 1993 to 2010. The long-term price sensitivity tends to decrease during economic expansions, whereas long-term advertising elasticities increase. During contractions, the long-term own and cross price elasticities increase. Moreover, throughout the observation period, the short-term price elasticity became significantly stronger. Finally, patterns differ across categories and brands, which presents opportunities for firms that know how to ride the economic tide.","Harald J. Van Heerde, Maarten J. Gijsenberg, Marnik G.

The authors propose that, ironically, self-relevance amplifies this duration framing effect. Consumers for whom a particular self-improvement domain is personally relevant are less likely to adopt a one-year self-improvement plan as compared with a 12-month plan because they perceive it as longer and more difficult. This bias is more likely to manifest in consumers who report that the task is highly personally relevant to them, who are making predictions for themselves (vs. others), and who have high (vs. low) task involvement. Personal relevance amplifies this effect because it prompts process-focused simulation of the plan, consequently increasing susceptibility to spurious duration and difficulty cues embedded in frames.","GüLden üLküMen, Manoj Thomas","duration framing, personal relevance, process simulation, mental simulation, duration perception",4,,,,

Specifically, they find that high-quality bidders tend to be more aggressive in bidding against potentially higher-quality competition and less aggressive when bidding against potentially lower-quality competition. In contrast, low-quality bidders appear aggressive regardless of their implied quality in relation to the competition.

This specification yields a novel set of 456 elasticities across categories and time that are generated using the same method and therefore can be directly compared. On average, price sensitivity is countercyclical: It rises when the macroeconomy weakens. However, substantial variation exists, and a handful of categories exhibit procyclical price sensitivity. The authors show that the relationship between price sensitivity and macroeconomic growth correlates strongly with the average level of price sensitivity in a category. They examine several explanations for this result and conclude that a category's share of wallet is the more likely driver versus alternative explanations based on product perishability, substitution across consumption channels, or market power.","Brett R.

The authors demonstrate that expertise contributes to the perceived benefits of an activity, which in turn leads to high value associated with it. Expertise also directly influences value obtained from an activity. This expertise, in turn, is acquired over time through past consumption. This finding implies a chain from expertise to value to time use and back to expertise, which may lead consumers to form a lifestyle in which they specialize in a subset of activities they know well.

Finally, the authors investigate the downstream consequences of usage estimation on product satisfaction, demonstrating that consumers who estimate usage before choice experience greater product satisfaction and are more likely to recommend their chosen product.

The authors show that fixed-effects estimators of this sort are inconsistent in the presence of installed-base effects; in simulations, random-effects specifications perform even worse. The analysis reveals the tension the applied empiricist faces in this area: a rich control for unobservables increases the credibility of the reported causal effects, but the incorporation of these controls introduces biases of a new kind in this class of models. The authors present two solutions: a modified version of an instrumental variable approach and a new bias-correction approach, both of which deliver consistent estimates of causal installed-base effects. The empirical application to the adoption of the Toyota Prius Hybrid in California shows evidence for social influence in diffusion and reveals that implementing the bias correction reverses the sign of the measured installed-base effect. The authors also discuss implications of the results for identification of models in marketing involving state dependence in demand, and incorporating discrete games of strategic interaction.","Sridhar Narayanan, Harikesh S.

The Impact of Sampling and Network Topology on the Estimation of Social Intercorrelations,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0026,01-Feb-13,01-Feb,2013,50,1,95,110,"With the growing popularity of online social networks, it is becoming more important for marketing researchers to understand and measure social intercorrelations among consumers. The authors show that the estimation of consumers' social intercorrelations can be significantly affected by the sampling method used in the study and the topology of the social network. Through a series of simulation studies using a spatial model, the authors find that the magnitude of social intercorrelations in consumer networks tends to be underestimated if samples of the networks are used (rather than using the entire population of the network). The authors further demonstrate that sampling methods that better preserve the network structure perform best in recovering the social intercorrelations. However, this advantage decreases in networks characterized by the scale-free power-law distribution for the number of connections of each member. The authors discuss the insights they glean from these findings and propose a method to obtain unbiased estimation of the magnitude of social intercorrelations.","Xinlei (Jack) Chen, Yuxin Chen, Ping Xiao","social network, sampling, network topology, spatial model",,,,,
Conditional Projection: How Own Evaluations Influence Beliefs about Others Whose Choices Are Known,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0052,01-Feb-13,01-Feb,2013,50,1,111,124,"The authors study how a person's evaluation of choice options influences his or her estimates of other people's evaluations when their choices are known. The study shows that people rely on the relationship between their own evaluations and their final decision to make sense of others, projecting their evaluations of the corresponding options. A person's liking of the option he or she chose between two alternatives influences the person's estimates of others' liking of the option they chose, regardless of whether it matches his or her own choice. Likewise, a person's evaluation of the rejected option affects his or her estimate of others' evaluations of the option they rejected. Across four studies, the authors provide evidence of conditional projection in political and consumer decisions, using across-people differences in ratings of choice options, within-person changes in ratings, and manipulated differences in participants' ratings. The authors also demonstrate that existing accounts of projection do not directly predict these findings and rule out other alternative explanations.","A.

They find that attachment styles predict customers' preferences for closeness better than established marketing variables do. Moreover, attachment styles and preferences for closeness influence loyalty intentions and behavior, controlling for established antecedents (e.g., relationship quality). Finally, exploring the underlying process, the authors show that preference for closeness partially mediates the effect of attachment styles on cross-buying behavior.

Their approach formally incorporates the dynamics induced by the repositioning in a model with strategic interaction. They exploit a unique data set containing the price format decisions of all U.S. supermarkets in the 1990s. The data contain the format change decisions of supermarkets in response to a large shock to their local market positions: the entry of Wal-Mart. The authors exploit the responses of retailers to Wal-Mart entry to infer the cost of changing pricing formats using a revealed-preference argument. The interaction between retailers and Wal-Mart in each market is modeled as a dynamic game. The authors find evidence that entry by Wal-Mart had a significant impact on the costs and incidence of switching pricing strategy. Their results add to the marketing literature on the organization of retail markets and have implications for long-term market structure in the supermarket industry. Their approach, which incorporates long-term dynamic consequences, strategic interaction, and sunk investment costs, may be used to empirically model firms’ positioning decisions in marketing more generally.","Paul B.

Advertising and Consumer Awareness of New, Differentiated Products,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0045,01-Dec-12,01-Dec,2012,49,6,773,792,"This article proposes a novel approach to assess the dynamic effect that advertising expenditures have on which products consumers include in their choice sets. In a discrete-choice model, consumers face choice sets that evolve according to their awareness of each product. Advertising expenditures have a dynamic effect in the sense that they raise consumer awareness of a product, increasing present and future sales. To estimate this effect, the authors explicitly model the firms’ dynamic advertising decisions and illustrate the model using data from the Spanish automobile market. The results show that the effect of advertising on awareness is dynamic and that accounting for it is crucial in explaining the evolution of product sales over its life cycle. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that the awareness process can be significantly sped up by advertising. Thus, there is a great heterogeneity in the length of the awareness process among products, depending on the level of advertising expenditures; it may range from one to six years.","Alicia Barroso, Gerard Llobet","advertising, discrete choice models, consumer choice set, awareness process, new products",,,,
Discovering how Advertising Grows Sales and Builds Brands,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0060,01-Dec-12,01-Dec,2012,49,6,793,806,"Advertising nudges consumers along the think–feel–do hierarchy of intermediate effects of advertising to induce sales. Because intermediate effects—cognition, affect, and experience—are unobservable constructs, brand managers use a battery of mind-set metrics to assess how advertising builds brands. However, extant sales response models explain how advertising grows sales but ignore the role of intermediate effects in building brands. To link these dual contributions of advertising, the authors propose an integrated framework that augments the dynamic advertising–sales response model by integrating the hierarchy, dynamic evolution, and purchase reinforcement of intermediate effects. Methodologically, the new approach incorporates the intermediate effects as factors from mind-set metrics while filtering out measurement noise, extracts the factor loadings, estimates the dynamic evolution of the factors, and infers their sequence in any hypothesized hierarchy by embedding their impact in a dynamic advertising–sales response model. The authors apply the proposed model and associated method to a major brand to discover the brand's operating hierarchy (advertising → experience → cognition → affect ↔ sales). The results provide the first empirical evidence that intermediate effects are indeed dynamic constructs, that purchase reinforcement effects exist not only for experience but also for other intermediate effects, and that advertising simultaneously contributes to both sales growth and brand building. Thus, both researchers and managers should consider using the proposed framework to capture advertising's dual contributions of building brands and growing sales.","Norris I.

New Drug Diffusion when Forward-Looking Physicians Learn from Patient Feedback and Detailing,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0114,01-Dec-12,01-Dec,2012,49,6,807,821,"The authors study physicians’ prescription choices when uncertainty about drug efficacy is resolved through two channels: firms’ marketing activities (e.g., detailing) and patients’ experiences with the drugs. They first provide empirical evidence that suggests that the well-understood information incentive for physicians to experiment with new drugs is reduced when physicians anticipate future detailing. Therefore, increased detailing activity triggers opposing forces: Adoption is hastened as physicians become informed (assuming prior knowledge is initially low) and slows as they reduce experimentation and instead obtain information from detailing at no cost. The authors then estimate a dynamic Bayesian learning model that embodies these trade-offs using physician-level data on prescription choices and detailing received in the months surrounding the introduction of two erectile dysfunction drugs, Levitra and Cialis. Detailing elasticities are lower when physicians anticipate changes in detailing activity than when such changes are unexpected. Accordingly, the authors conclude that to maximize the effect of detailing, firms should avoid announcing increases in detailing activities.","Pradeep K. Chintagunta, Ronald L.

Determining Consumers’ Discount Rates with Field Studies,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0009,01-Dec-12,01-Dec,2012,49,6,822,841,"Because utility/profits, state transitions, and discount rates are confounded in dynamic models, discount rates are typically fixed for the purpose of identification. The authors propose a strategy of identifying discount rates. The identification rests on imputing the utility/profits using decisions made in a context in which the future is inconsequential, the objective function is concave, and the decision space is continuous. They then use these utilities/profits to identify discount rates in contexts in which dynamics become material. The authors exemplify this strategy using a field study in which cell phone users transitioned from a linear to a three-part-tariff pricing plan. They find that the estimated discount rate corresponds to a weekly discount factor (.90), lower than the value typically assumed in empirical research (.995). When using a standard .995 discount factor, they find that the price coefficient is underestimated by 16%. Moreover, the predicted intertemporal substitution pattern and demand elasticities are biased, leading to a 29% deterioration in model fit and suboptimal pricing recommendations that would lower potential revenue gains by 76%.","Song Yao, Carl F.

They embed the factor model in a direct utility model that allows for both corner and interior solutions and show that it fits the data better than alternative specifications.

Are these effects moderated by visibility, the ease of seeing others’ behavior? Do they vary according to the identity (e.g., gender) of prior purchasers and the identity relevance of vehicle type? The authors perform an extensive set of tests to rule out alternatives to visual influence and find that visual effects are (1) present (one additional purchase for approximately every seven prior purchases), (2) larger in areas where others’ behavior should be more visible (i.e., more people commute in car-visible ways), (3) stronger for prior purchases by men than by women in male-oriented vehicle types, (4) extant only for cars of similar price tiers, and (5) subject to saturation effects.","Blakeley B.

When Guilt Begets Pleasure: The Positive Effect of a Negative Emotion,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.09.0421,01-Dec-12,01-Dec,2012,49,6,872,881,"Understanding how emotions can affect pleasure has important implications both for people and for firms’ communication strategies.

In contrast, the authors demonstrate that the activation of guilt, a negative emotion, enhances the pleasure experienced from hedonic consumption. The authors show that this effect occurs because of a cognitive association between guilt and pleasure, such that activating guilt can automatically activate cognitions related to pleasure. Furthermore, the authors show that this pattern of results is unique to guilt and cannot be explained by a contrast effect that generalizes to other negative emotions.

When Talk is “Free”: The Effect of Tariff Structure on Usage under Two- and Three-Part Tariffs,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0444,18-Oct-18,01-Dec,2012,49,6,882,899,"In many service industries, firms introduce three-part tariffs to replace or complement existing two-part tariffs. In contrast with two-part tariffs, three-part tariffs offer allowances, or “free” units of the service. Behavioral research suggests that the attributes of a pricing plan may affect behavior beyond their direct cost implications. Evidence suggests that customers value free units above and beyond what might be expected from the change in their budget constraint. Nonlinear pricing research, however, has not considered such an effect. The authors examine a market in which three-part tariffs were introduced for the first time. They analyze tariff choice and usage behavior for customers who switch from two-part to three-part tariffs. The findings show that switchers significantly “overuse” in comparison with their prior two-part tariff usage. That is, they attain a level of consumption that cannot be explained by a shift in the budget constraint. The authors estimate a discrete/continuous model of tariff choice and usage that accounts for the valuation of free units. The results show that the majority of three-part-tariff users value minutes under a three-part tariff more than they do under a two-part tariff.

The Best of Both Worlds?

Four studies demonstrate that not all health claims are created equal. The authors suggest that the nature of the food attributes the claims emphasize—namely, functional versus hedonic—determines the extent of consumption of the indulgence. Health claims featuring functional attributes (e.g., “extra antioxidants”) trigger high levels of health-goal accessibility, which, together with simultaneously accessible indulgence goals attached to the indulgence, results in goal conflict. This conflict leads to reduced consumption of the food. In contrast, health claims featuring hedonic attributes (e.g., “low fat”) render health goals less accessible while accentuating the pleasure dimension of the food, resulting in lower goal conflict and increased consumption of the food. Implications for the food industry and public policy makers are discussed.","Nina Belei, Kelly Geyskens, Caroline Goukens,...","health claims, goal conflict, self-control, consumption",3,,,,

Three additional studies focus on the negative moderating effect of company–cause fit and provide insights into the underlying moderation process.

How Attribute Quantity Influences Option Choice,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0142,01-Dec-12,01-Dec,2012,49,6,942,953,"Products can be described by different numbers of attributes, but can the mere number of attributes presented across a choice set influence what type of options people choose? This article demonstrates that attribute numerosity tends to benefit certain types of options more than others and consequently has systematic effects on choice. Because attributes often serve as a heuristic cue for product usefulness, they benefit options that people perceive as relatively inferior on this dimension. Consistent with this perspective, five studies demonstrate that attribute numerosity benefits hedonic more than utilitarian options by increasing the extent to which the former appear useful. Consequently, increasing attribute quantity equally across the choice set shifts choice toward hedonic options, regardless of whether the attributes are hedonic, utilitarian, or mixed in nature. Consistent with this conceptualization, these effects become amplified when decision makers engage in heuristic processing and when priming makes usefulness salient. The findings have important implications for how marketers present attribute information, for public policy and consumer welfare, and for understanding argument numerosity effects in persuasion more broadly.","Aner Sela, Jonah Berger","attributes, numerosity, hedonic and utilitarian choice, attitudes, conjoint analysis",,,,,

As a spectator (e.g., watching a game), independents’ (vs. interdependents') experience consumption evaluations are more likely to be influenced by outcome, while interdependent (vs. independent) consumers are more likely to be affected by process.

They demonstrate the power of BEA in predicting consumer reactions to brand extensions, particularly among consumers with strong self–brand connections. Not only is BEA distinct from two conceptualizations of fit in brand extension literature—fit as similarity and fit as relevance—but it also moderates the effects of both fit dimensions on brand extension responses. By capturing a cultural and consumer relational perspective that shapes reactions to brand extensions, BEA provides an important, complementary construct for predicting brand extension success and enhancing brand value.

They use transactions conducted with a single supplier in that category to infer consumers' behavior with other suppliers in that category. In particular, armed with prior knowledge of the parametric form of consumer interpurchase time distributions, they uncover elements of the stochastic process that dictates which supplier a consumer chooses on a particular purchase occasion. The authors focus on interpurchase times because they form the core of the incomplete information problem. If a company uses its observed interpurchase times to estimate interpurchase times in the category for a specific consumer, its estimate will be biased upward. Combined with the model developed in this study, a familiar analysis of transaction profitability can be used to build a new type of lifetime value: lifetime category value of the customer.","Yuxin Chen, Joel H.

Self-Threat and Product Failure: How Internal Attributions of Blame Affect Consumer Complaining Behavior,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0169,01-Oct-12,01-Oct,2012,49,5,670,681,"Previous research in complaining behavior has focused on product or service failures in which the organization is responsible for the failure. In these cases, researchers have found that consumers feel better about the product failure after complaining about it. In contrast, the authors show that when consumers are to blame for product failure, complaining has a detrimental effect on consumer reactions to the product. In this context, self-threat from the product failure is shown to motivate defensive processing in both the content of complaints and the subsequent downstream product evaluations. The authors establish the role of self-threat in product failure in two ways: (1) by varying the intensity of the threat from product failure and (2) through mitigating negative outcomes through self-affirmation. The article concludes with discussion on how these findings can benefit companies and where this research could seed opportunities for subsequent investigation.","Lea Dunn, Darren W.

In contrast to this “pain-of-losing” account, the authors propose that the endowment effect reflects a reluctance to trade on terms that appear unfavorable with respect to salient reference prices. In six experiments (and eight more summarized in appendixes), the authors show that manipulations that reduce the gap between valuations and reference prices reduce or eliminate the endowment effect. These results suggest that the endowment effect is often best construed as an aversion to bad deals rather than an aversion to losing possessions.","Ray Weaver, Shane Frederick","endowment effect, reference prices, transaction utility, loss aversion, fairness",34,,,,
The Influence of Price Presentation Order on Consumer Choice,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0309,01-Oct-12,01-Oct,2012,49,5,708,717,"Existing theory and prior research suggest that consumers perceive purchase prices more/less favorably when they are preceded by higher/lower prices. However, to date, researchers have found these effects in contexts in which the product, and thus perceived quality, is held constant. Given that consumers commonly believe price and quality are positively correlated and that price–quality perceptions have been shown to influence price evaluations and willingness to pay, the generalizability of existing research to commonly encountered contexts is questionable. In this research, the authors examine the influence of price order on consumer choice across differing brands in contexts in which consumer quality perceptions are free to covary with price and they are manipulated to be correlated or uncorrelated with price. Using reference dependence theory as a framework, they find that when differing brand options are presented in descending price order, consumers tend to choose higher-price options; when they are presented in ascending price order, consumers tend to choose lower-priced options (the price order effect). In addition, the authors show that consumers' price–quality perceptions are a necessary condition for this effect.","Kwanho Suk, Jiheon Lee, Donald R.

To demonstrate the importance of the methodology, the authors investigate two issues of relevance to retailers, namely, how retailers should (1) allocate promotional expenditures across brands in a category and (2) coordinate timing of promotions of brands across categories. The authors estimate the proposed model using consumers' purchases in pasta sauce and pasta categories. The results reveal that using restrictive functional forms of utilities or ignoring cross-category effects in incidence and quantity decisions leads to incorrect assessments on relative allocation of promotional expenditures across brands. Furthermore, retailers are better off contemporaneously promoting brands across the two categories than promoting them in different periods, and ignoring cross-category effects in quantity decisions leads to the opposite inference, namely, that retailers are better off promoting brands across the two categories in different periods.","Nitin Mehta, Yu Ma","multicategory brand choice decisions, purchase incidence decisions, quantity decisions, basket utility maximization, choice models",3,,

Dynamic Effectiveness of Advertising and Word of Mouth in Sequential Distribution of New Products,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.07.0441,01-Aug-12,01-Aug,2012,49,4,469,486,"Firms in many industries release new products in sequential stages.

Thus, communication mix elements—advertising and word of mouth (WOM)—can play important, distinct, and yet interdependent roles in stimulating new product demand. Their effectiveness may fluctuate within and across stages and spill over from earlier to later stages. Thus, the authors construct a dynamic linear model to study the dynamic effects of advertising and WOM on demand for heterogeneous products across stages. They further apply the model to examine a canonical example, the theater-then-video sequential distribution of motion pictures, and estimate the parameters using Kalman filtering/smoothing and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The results show that advertising and WOM exert dynamic, yet diverse, influences on demand for new products. For example, while increased ad spending is more effective at an earlier stage due to repetition wear-in and synergy with WOM, increased WOM activities at a later stage could become more powerful in driving demand. Subsequent optimization exercises suggest that films of varied characteristics can potentially re-allocate their advertising budgets and reap additional revenues.","Norris I.

Can Small Victories Help Win the War?

The authors examine this question in the context of an important goal for a large number of consumers—getting out of debt. Using a data set obtained from a debt settlement firm, they find that (1) closing debt accounts is predictive of debt elimination regardless of the dollar balance of the closed accounts, whereas (2) the dollar balance of closed accounts is not predictive of debt elimination when controlling for the fraction of accounts closed.

In this study, the authors demonstrate how the latter can be improved by uncovering common trajectories hidden behind the coevolution of a large array of indicators. The authors propose a structural dynamic factor-analytic model that can be applied for simultaneously analyzing tens or even hundreds of time series, distilling them into a few key latent dynamic factors that isolate seasonal cyclic movements from nonseasonal, nonstationary trend lines.

Investing for Retirement: The Moderating Effect of Fund Assortment Size on the 1/N Heuristic,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.08.0355,01-Aug-12,01-Aug,2012,49,4,537,550,"Does the number of funds offered in a defined contribution plan affect how many funds consumers choose to invest in or how they spread dollars across the funds they choose?

The authors decompose this heuristic into its two underlying behavioral dimensions: the tendency to invest in all available funds (which they label “1/n#”) and the tendency to spread the invested dollars evenly across chosen funds (which they label “1/n$”). The authors argue that choosing from larger fund assortments taxes investors' cognitive resources, which leads to more simplified diversification strategies. They find that increasing the fund assortment size decreases the tendency to invest in all available funds (1/n#) but increases the tendency to spread the invested dollars evenly among the chosen alternatives (1/n$), provided that the number of funds chosen for investment allows for easy equal dollar allocations.

The results from a study of 828 salespeople in 204 branches of a large distributor of industrial goods provide evidence that perceived outcome risk containment and outcome reward emphasis enhance primary appraisals, whereas perceived process risk containment and process reward emphasis enhance secondary appraisals. In turn, the authors find that salespeople's primary and secondary appraisals influence their change implementation behaviors, leading to successful change implementation. Notably, they also find that (outcome and process) risk containment has a greater influence on appraisals of salespeople with a higher performance orientation, but the effects of (outcome and process) reward emphases are invariant across salespeople's performance orientation.

This research focuses on mating mind-sets (i.e., thinking about a mate), which consumers commonly experience. Specifically, the authors propose that mating mind-sets triggered by the external situation can influence brand extension evaluations, particularly for men. Mating mind-sets induce male consumers (but not female consumers) to engage in relational processing, increasing fit perceptions and evaluations for moderately dissimilar brand extensions. These differences are more likely to emerge when a short-term mating mind-set is primed (vs. a long-term mating mind-set). Furthermore, using prestige brands (vs. functional brands) reduces the gap between men and women. In addition, subbrand architecture (vs. direct brand architecture) boosts the evaluations of female consumers but decreases those of male consumers.

They decompose the deterministic component of product utility into two parts: that accounted for by observed attributes and that due to nonobserved attributes. The authors estimate the unobserved component by relating it to the corresponding residuals of virtual experts representing homogeneous groups of people who experienced the product earlier and evaluated it. Their methodology involves identifying such virtual experts and determining the relative importance they should be given in the estimation of the target person's residuals. Using Bayesian estimation methods and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation inference, the authors apply their approach to two types of consumer preference data: (1) online consumer ratings (stated preferences) data for Internet recommendation services and (2) offline consumer viewership (revealed preferences) data for movies.

They estimate their model on keyword-level paid search data containing daily information on impressions, clicks, and reservations for a major lodging chain.

When advertisements are served in higher positions, approximately one-third of new conversions is due to increased click-through while approximately two-thirds are due to increased conversion rates.

Researchers have typically explained the diversification effect in terms of differences in the process by which people select items from among those available. This precludes the possibility that the locus of the effect lies in people's choice sets themselves—that is, how people decide which options to consider when making choices. The authors examine the effects of set formation using an experimental choice sequence task and conjoined stochastic model of set formation and conditional choice. The findings demonstrate that set formation plays a critical role in diversification: Previously chosen options are indeed discounted, but only for simultaneous choices and only in the set formation portion of the model. Furthermore, the expected number of choice set items is substantially greater in multiple- versus single- item choice. Specifically, when consumers choose simultaneously choice set sizes appear relatively larger overall, but the previously chosen item is less likely to be in a person's (latent) choice set. These findings cannot be attributed to alternative patterns of covariation, including latent error correlations; to temporal stochastic inflation; or to unobserved heterogeneity.","Linda Court Salisbury, Fred M.

However, in the absence of similarity information, a low (vs. high) base rate of crises leads to less blame toward the brand (referred to as the “subtyping effect”). For brands with negative prior beliefs, the extent of blame attributed to the brand is unaffected by the base-rate and similarity information. Importantly, the same base-rate information may have a different effect on the attribution of a subsequent crisis depending on whether discounting or subtyping occurred in the attribution of the first crisis. Consumers who discount a first crisis also tend to discount a second crisis for the same brand, whereas consumers who subtype a first crisis are unlikely to subtype again.","Jing Lei, Niraj Dawar, Zeynep Gürhan-Canli","base-rate information, consumer attributions, product-harm crises",,,,,

Although a firm's profits might be expected to decrease when a competitor expands its product line because the firm loses some sales to the new product, this intuition is incomplete because a competitor's product line expansion can also soften price competition. The author first provides an example using the Hotelling model that demonstrates the possibility and mechanism of profit-increasing competitor entry. He then presents conditions under which a competitor's product line expansion increases profits under the mixed-logit model. The study demonstrates that firms benefit from a rival's entry most when a moderate number of customers are unserved before the new-product introduction and when the new product is positioned such that both the rivals' products appeal to similar sets of customers. With regard to extensions, this study demonstrates that the result continues to hold when firms choose product attributes endogenously and that a manufacturer's profits can increase from a rival's product line expansion even when the firms sell through a retailer.",Raphael Thomadsen,"pricing, competition, product line, product differentiation, new product introduction",,,,,

The results indicate that subbranded extensions (e.g., Quencher by Tropicana cola) evoke a slower, more thoughtful subtyping processing strategy than family branded extensions (e.g., Tropicana cola), which evoke a faster, category-based processing strategy. As a result, category similarity affects extension evaluations when the extension is family branded but not when it is subbranded.

Subbranding thus offers two key benefits to marketers: It both enhances extension evaluations and protects the parent brand from any unwanted negative feedback.","Sanjay Sood, Kevin Lane Keller","brand naming, brand dilution, subbranding, categorization, product experience",1,,,,
How Disgust Enhances the Effectiveness of Fear Appeals,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.07.0364,01-Jun-12,01-Jun,2012,49,3,383,393,"The current research explores the role of disgust in enhancing compliance with fear appeals.

Does Online Community Participation Foster Risky Financial Behavior?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.08.0499,01-Jun-12,01-Jun,2012,49,3,394,407,"Although consumers increasingly use online communities for various activities, little is known about how participation in them affects people's decision-making strategies. Through a series of field and laboratory studies, the authors demonstrate that participation in an online community increases people's risk-seeking tendencies in their financial decisions and behaviors. The results reveal that participation in an online community leads consumers to believe that they will receive help or support from other members should difficulties arise. Such a perception leads online community participants to make riskier financial decisions than nonparticipants. The authors also discover a boundary condition to the effect: Online community members are more risk seeking only when they have relatively strong ties with other members; when ties are weak, they exhibit similar risk preferences as nonmembers.","Rui (Juliet) Zhu, Utpal M.

New Products: The Antidote to Private Label Growth?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0183,01-Jun-12,01-Jun,2012,49,3,408,423,"As private labels (PLs) continue to grow in power and market share, product innovation has become one of the strongest weapons in the national brand (NB) manufacturer's arsenal. In this article, the author assesses when and to what extent new products change NBs' market position. To address this question, more than 300 NB and PL introductions are analyzed using a multibreak model that quantifies the impact of product introductions on own share, rival NB and PL share, and category sales. Drawing on empirical generalizations, the author finds that products introduced by leading NBs, standard PLs, and premium PLs are more likely to increase category sales than products introduced by follower NBs or economy PLs. New products introduced by leader and follower NBs more often boost own share. Thus, new products help prevent the decline of NB shares. With respect to competitive impact, new products affect rival shares, with the exception of those launched by economy PLs. Still, NBs tend to hurt rival NBs more often than PLs, and only the leading NB is likely to steal share from all three PL tiers. Moreover, standard PLs tend to be harmed less often by rival new products, unless introduced by the leading NB. Overall, PLs are more likely to be affected by a NB that maintains a large price gap and offers new products with new intrinsic or usage benefits. To fight economy PLs successfully, however, NBs must maintain a smaller price gap, while offering products that focus less on intrinsic and usage benefits.",Katrijn Gielens,"private labels, national brands, retailing, competition, new products, empirical generalizations",,,,,

Little is known, however, about Wal-Mart's influence on suppliers' performance. Manufacturers suggest that Wal-Mart uses its power to squeeze their profits. In this article, the authors study the validity of this claim. They investigate the underlying mechanisms that may cause changes in manufacturer profits following Wal-Mart market entry. The data contain information on supplier interactions with retail stores, including Wal-Mart, for a period of five years. They find that postentry supplier profits increased by 18% on average, whereas profits derived from incumbent retailers decreased only marginally. Their results show that wholesale prices are not the main driver of postentry supplier profit changes; market expansion is. They observe a significant increase in shipments to 50% of markets studied. Furthermore, their analyses demonstrate that supplier shipment and profit increases are highest for markets in which incumbents offer a wide variety of products and carry items that Wal-Mart does not sell.","Qingyi Huang, Vincent R.

They assessed concentration of attention through eye tracking and viewer retention by recording zapping behavior. This allows tests of predictions about the interplay of these emotions and interperson attention differences at each point in time during exposure. Surprise and joy effectively concentrate attention and retain viewers. However, importantly, the level rather than the velocity of surprise affects attention concentration most, whereas the velocity rather than the level of joy affects viewer retention most. The effect of joy is asymmetric, with higher gains for increases than losses for decreases.

The Impact of Relative Standards on the Propensity to Disclose,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.09.0215,01-Apr-12,01-Apr,2012,49,2,160,174,"Two sets of studies illustrate the comparative nature of disclosure behavior. The first set investigates how divulgence is affected by signals about others' readiness to divulge and shows a “herding” effect: Survey respondents are more willing to divulge sensitive information when told that previous respondents have made sensitive disclosures (Study 1a). The authors provide evidence of the process underlying this effect and rule out alternative explanations by showing that information on others' propensity to disclose affects respondents' discomfort associated with divulgence (Study 1b) but not their interpretation of the questions (Study 1c). The second set of studies investigates how divulgence is affected by the order in which inquiries of varying intrusiveness are made and suggests that divulgence is anchored by the initial questions in a survey. People are particularly likely to divulge when questions are presented in decreasing order of intrusiveness and less likely when questions are presented in increasing order (Study 2a). The authors show that the effect arises by affecting people's judgments of the intrusiveness of the inquiries (Study 2b). The effect is altered when, at the outset of the study, privacy concerns are primed (Study 2c) and when respondents are made to consider the relative intrusiveness of a different set of questions (Study 2d).

What Makes Online Content Viral?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0353,01-Apr-12,01-Apr,2012,49,2,192,205,"Why are certain pieces of online content (e.g., advertisements, videos, news articles) more viral than others? This article takes a psychological approach to understanding diffusion. Using a unique data set of all the New York Times articles published over a three-month period, the authors examine how emotion shapes virality. The results indicate that positive content is more viral than negative content, but the relationship between emotion and social transmission is more complex than valence alone. Virality is partially driven by physiological arousal. Content that evokes high-arousal positive (awe) or negative (anger or anxiety) emotions is more viral. Content that evokes low-arousal, or deactivating, emotions (e.g., sadness) is less viral. These results hold even when the authors control for how surprising, interesting, or practically useful content is (all of which are positively linked to virality), as well as external drivers of attention (e.g., how prominently content was featured). Experimental results further demonstrate the causal impact of specific emotion on transmission and illustrate that it is driven by the level of activation induced. Taken together, these findings shed light on why people share content and how to design more effective viral marketing campaigns.","Jonah Berger, Katherine L.

The Importance of the Context in Brand Extension: How Pictures and Comparisons Shift Consumers' Focus from Fit to Quality,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.08.0060,01-Apr-12,01-Apr,2012,49,2,206,217,"It is well established that consumers' evaluations of brand extensions depend on the quality of the parent brand and the fit between that brand and the extension category. The authors propose that the relative importance of these two factors is influenced by two key features of a typical shopping environment: the presence of visual information and the availability of comparison brands. In particular, the authors demonstrate that adding pictures and enabling brand comparisons shift consumers' preference from extensions of better-fitting brands to extensions of higher-quality brands. The authors propose that this occurs because pictures and brand comparisons create a more concrete representation of the extension, which in turn increases the importance of parent brand quality relative to brand–extension fit.

When Budgeting Backfires: How Self-Imposed Price Restraints Can Increase Spending,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0508,01-Apr-12,01-Apr,2012,49,2,218,230,"A common strategy for controlling spending is to impose a price restraint on oneself. For example, a consumer who is concerned with limiting expenses may decide before going shopping that he or she only wants to spend approximately $100 for a particular purchase. Although conventional wisdom predicts that self-imposed price restraints will decrease consumer spending, the authors show that salient price restraints can actually increase consumers' preferences for high-priced, high-quality items. The authors propose that making a price restraint salient has the effect of partitioning consumers' evaluations of price and quality, leading to larger differences in perceived quality between options and a greater focus on quality during the final decision. Thus, while budgets and other types of price restraints can limit spending by eliminating some high-priced options from consideration, this research suggests that they can also have the ironic effect of increasing consumers' spending relative to a situation in which consumers have not imposed a price restraint.","Jeffrey S.

Consumption-Based Cross-Brand Learning: Are Private Labels Really Private?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.07.0416,01-Apr-12,01-Apr,2012,49,2,231,246,"While some researchers view private labels (PLs) as a key tool for retailer differentiation, others imply that consumers do not distinguish between PLs of different chains. This debate raises the question: Do a retail chain's PL investments subsidize rival PLs? In addition, how does this affect their choice share vis-à-vis national brands? The authors investigate whether consumers generalize knowledge from product experience across PLs of different retail chains and whether such cross-brand learning depends on the PL brands' link with the chain name or on their quality differences. The proposed brand choice model captures cross-brand learning through quality perception spillovers (consumers adjust beliefs about PL quality on the basis of consumption experience) and familiarity spillovers (uncertainty about a PL diminishes with rival PL consumption). Household scanner panel data on dish soap and breakfast cereals yield clear evidence of cross-retailer learning among standard PLs, regardless of their name or quality differences. The results also reveal that familiarity spillovers dominate quality-level spillovers, implying that the presence of cross-learning benefits PLs and enhances their market position relative to national brands.

The authors examine the influence of three manipulations of cognitive flexibility—positive affect, a future (vs. past) launch description, and a cognitive flexibility prime—on evaluations of new products. The results from four experiments show that these factors facilitate participants' ability to make sense of extremely incongruent new products and that incongruity resolution leads to more positive evaluations. The results also indicate that understanding the benefits provided by extremely new products, rather than affect arising from resolution, leads to higher evaluations of these products.","Ji Hoon Jhang, Susan Jung Grant, Margaret C.

Integrating three archival data sources and a survey of 206 franchisees across eight automotive brands, the authors find that franchisor reliance on contractual completeness appears to result in reduced ex post behavior monitoring and enforcement efforts, while contractual one-sidedness is associated with higher levels of behavior monitoring but reduced enforcement. Extracontractual incentives, when offered to the franchisee, are associated with increases in monitoring and enforcement. In isolation, franchisor monitoring and enforcement efforts are ineffective in eliciting desired franchisee behaviors. However, different combinations of franchisor monitoring and enforcement efforts affect franchisee compliance and opportunism, sometimes with counterproductive results. The study provides an initial baseline of understanding on how ex ante governance characteristics and combinations of ex post governance mechanisms function to facilitate or deter franchisee compliance and opportunism.","Vishal Kashyap, Kersi D.

Searching in Choice Mode: Consumer Decision Processes in Product Search with Recommendations,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.09.0481,01-Apr-12,01-Apr,2012,49,2,277,288,"This article examines how a common form of decision assistance— recommendations that present products in order of their predicted attractiveness to a consumer—transforms decision processes during product search. Such recommendations induce a shift in consumers' decision orientation in search from being directed at whether additional alternatives should be inspected to identifying the best alternative among those already encountered, which is common when choosing from predetermined sets of alternatives. That is, recommendations cause consumers to search in “choice mode.” Evidence from three studies provides support for such a transformation of search decisions, which manifests itself in two respects. First, compared with unassisted search, recommendations lead consumers to assess a product they encounter in their search by comparing it less with the best one discovered up to that point and more with other previously inspected alternatives. Second, recommendations transform how variability in product attractiveness affects stopping decisions such that greater variability causes consumers to search less, which is contrary to what is commonly observed in search without recommendations.","Benedict G.C.

Spatiotemporal Allocation of Advertising Budgets,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0029,01-Feb-12,01-Feb,2012,49,1,1,14,"This article develops a method for optimal allocation of resources based on an empirically validated model of how national and regional advertising generate sales over time. The authors derive the profit-maximizing total budget, its optimal split between national and regional spends, and its optimal allocation across multiple regions. They formulate a spatiotemporal model that accounts for spatial and serial dependence, spatial heterogeneity, neighborhood effects, and sales dynamics. Because of spatial and serial dependence, correlated multivariate Brownian motion drives the sales dynamics, resulting in a second-order differential equation for the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation with multiple states (i.e., regional sales) and multiple controls (i.e., regional and national advertising expenditures). By solving the HJB equation analytically, the authors furnish closed-form expressions for the optimal total budget and its regional allocations. In addition, they develop a method to estimate the proposed model and apply it to market data from a leading German cosmetics company. Using the estimated parameters, they evaluate the optimal budget and allocations. Comparing them with actual company policy, the proposed approach enhances profit by 5.07%, and it not only identifies which regions under-or overspend but also reveals how much budget to shift from national to regional advertising (or vice versa).","Ashwin Aravindakshan, Kay Peters, Prasad A.

Five experiments demonstrate that these self-signaling costs and benefits of temptation depend not only on the chosen item but also on the temptation from the nonchosen options.

While effectiveness cues may increase initial purchase, they can curb postpurchase consumption and potentially decrease long-term product sales. Four studies demonstrate that salient cues in advertising or packaging (e.g., pictures, brand names) can increase perceived product efficacy and lead to a lower usage amount on a single occasion. The authors show that the impact of effectiveness cues on product usage is driven by inference making and is moderated by cue salience and people's need for cognition. Furthermore, the authors find that promoting effectiveness with certain cues does not increase product choice yet reduces product usage.

They find that after a retailer switched from a conventional LP to the IBLP, consumers became more responsive to reward point promotions than to price discounts of the same monetary value, were no longer responsive to competitors' reward point promotions, and exhibited stronger cumulative reward point effects. In addition, the new LP had a significantly different impact on “current” LP members and nonmembers (defined by their status right before the switch), resulting in decreased (increased) total spending by the former (latter) group, under the retailer's current promotion practice. Furthermore, it is critically important for retailers to offer sufficient promotions under the new LP to achieve its full potential; otherwise, they risk alienating their loyal customers. Finally, the IBLP reduced attrition among existing customers and attracted more new customers, which contributed to most of the retailer's sales revenue gain after adopting the IBLP.","Jie Zhang, Els Breugelmans","retail management, loyalty program design, promotion strategy, reward point promotions, retailer–manufacturer collaboration",7,,,,
Paying with Money or Effort: Pricing When Customers Anticipate Hassle,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.09.0530,01-Feb-12,01-Feb,2012,49,1,66,82,"For many services, customers subscribe to long-term contracts. Standard economic theory suggests that customers evaluate a contract on the basis of its overall net benefits. The authors suggest that rather than evaluating multiperiod service contracts at the contract level, customers use period-level bracketing. Customers evaluate the distinct per-period loss or gain they incur from choosing this contract. This has important consequences when benefits vary over the course of the contract—for example, due to “hassle costs.” If customers use period-level bracketing, they will value a lower price more in periods during which they have hassle than in other periods. The authors explore this using data from a field experiment for web hosting services. They find that a lower price in the initial period is more attractive to customers when they expect their hassle costs to be high at setup. In five lab experiments, the authors support and extend the field experiment's findings. They find evidence for period-level bracketing when customers have hassle costs, independently of whether hassle costs occur in the first, an intermediate, or the last period of a contract. They also rule out alternative explanations, such as hyperbolic discounting. The findings suggest that in setting prices, firms should consider the timing of hassle costs customers face.","Anja Lambrecht, Catherine Tucker","pricing, services, field experiment, contractual discounting, hassle costs, period-level bracketing",,,,,

The profile of the readers matters because advertisers want to target readers who are likely to be receptive to their advertising messages. The authors demonstrate that when advertising supplements subscription fees, it may serve as a polarizing or moderating force, contingent on the extent of heterogeneity among advertisers in appealing to readers having different political preferences. When heterogeneity is large, each advertiser chooses a single outlet for placing advertisements (single-homing), and greater polarization arises in comparison to when the media outlet relies on subscription fees only for revenues. In contrast, when heterogeneity is small, each advertiser chooses to place advertisements in multiple outlets (multihoming) and reduces polarization results.","Esther Gal-or, Tansev Geylani, Tuba Pinar Yildirim","media competition, bias in news, advertising, two-sided markets",,,,,

The results show that the firm faces reinforcing cross-market effects, its demand from both groups depends on marketing investments, and the model exhibits good forecasting capability.

The Fewer the Better: Number of Goals and Savings Behavior,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0250,01-Dec-11,01-Dec,2011,48,6,944,957,"This article examines the effect of the number of goals on consumers’ savings behavior. Drawing from research on implementation intention, the authors show that under certain conditions, presenting a single savings goal leads to greater savings intention and actual savings than presenting multiple savings goals. Multiple goals typically evoke trade-offs among competing goals and thus increase the likelihood that people will remain in a deliberative mind-set and defer actions. In contrast, the authors propose and demonstrate that a single goal evokes a stronger implementation intention, which in turn has a greater effect on behavior change. They also show that the advantage of a single goal over multiple goals on saving is attenuated when saving is easier to implement or when the multiple savings goals are integrated rather than competing among themselves. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","Dilip Soman, Min Zhao","saving, implementation intention, goals, goal number, mind-set",27,,,,
Framing Goals to Influence Personal Savings: The Role of Specificity and Construal Level,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.09.0516,01-Dec-11,01-Dec,2011,48,6,958,969,"In four studies, the authors show that consumers’ savings can be increased or decreased merely by changing the way consumers think about their saving goals. Consumers can (1) either specify or not specify an exact amount to save (goal specificity) and (2) focus on either how to save or why to save (construal level). The results illustrate that specific goals help consumers save more when the saving goal is construed at a high level but that nonspecific goals help consumers save more when the saving goal is construed at a low level. The same pattern of results occurs with anticipated saving success and actual savings. Mediation analyses reveal that for high-level construers, specific (vs. nonspecific) goals lead to success because they are perceived as more important. However, specific (vs. nonspecific) goals are also perceived as more difficult, which is more discouraging for low-level construers.","Gülden Ülkümen, Amar Cheema","goals, saving, financial decision making, goal specificity, construal level",10,,,,
The Psychology of Decisions to Abandon Waits for Service,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0382,16-Oct-18,01-Dec,2011,48,6,970,984,"This research investigates the process that underlies consumer decisions to abandon waits for service. The work centers on a hypothesis that stay-or-renege decisions reflect a process that blends two opposing psychic forces: escalating displeasure with waiting versus an escalating commitment to a wait that has been initiated. The consequence is a predicted tendency that abandonments are most likely near the midpoint of waits, which is suboptimal for many waiting time distributions. This study tests the hypothesis using data from three laboratory experiments in which participants play a time-management game that involves waiting for downloads from different computer servers, as well as field data about hang-ups in an emergency call center in India. The data lend support to the proposed competing hazards model and show that the trade-off between desires to abandon and persist is moderated by contextual factors, such as the initial number of alternative queues and the amount of distracting activity engaged in during a wait.","Narayan Janakiraman, Robert J.

Two often-cited drivers of these profits are cross-channel substitution among posttheatrical channels and seasonality in consumer preferences for any movie. The authors use a differentiated products version of the multiplicative competitive interaction model to investigate these two phenomena. They estimate the model using data from 2000 and 2001 on two posttheatrical channels in the U.S. market: purchase and rental home viewing channels. Contrary to expectations based on business press commentary, after controlling for seasonality and movie attributes, the authors find low cross-channel price and availability elasticity for both channels. To measure the extent of cross-channel cannibalization, they simulate a 28-day window of sequential release with either purchase or rental channel going first. They find that windowing reduces the sum of revenues across both channels, because more consumers choose to not purchase or rent when faced with older movies in their favored channel rather than to switch to the alternative channel with newer movies.","Anirban Mukherjee, Vrinda Kadiyali","multiple channel demand, market share, seasonality, entertainment industry",,,,,

Two experimental studies, run in a knitting and a crafting context, challenge this intuition and suggest that restricting the choice of creative inputs actually enhances creativity for experienced consumers.

Compounding the issue, many incongruent products are the result of innovative changes in product form intended to increase hedonic appeal. Crossing various product categories with various positioning tactics in a single meta-analytic framework, the authors find that positioning plays an important role in how consumers evaluate incongruent form. The results demonstrate that when a product is positioned on functional dimensions, consumers show more preferential evaluations for moderately incongruent form than for congruent form. However, when a product is positioned on experiential dimensions, consumers show more preferential evaluations for congruent form than for moderately incongruent form. Importantly, an increase in perceived hedonic benefits mediates the former, whereas a decrease in perceived utilitarian benefits mediates the latter. The mediation effects are consistent with the view that consumers must first understand a product's functionality before engaging in hedonic consumption.","Theodore J.

This research proposes that because consumers’ certainty about their beliefs (e.g., attitudes, opinions) is less salient than the beliefs themselves, certainty information is more susceptible to being lost in communication. Consistent with this idea, the current studies reveal that though consumers transmit their core beliefs when they communicate with one another, they often fail to transmit their certainty or uncertainty about those beliefs. Thus, a belief originally associated with high uncertainty (certainty) tends to lose this uncertainty (certainty) across communications. The authors demonstrate that increasing the salience of consumers’ uncertainty/certainty when communicating or receiving information can improve uncertainty/certainty communication, and they investigate the consequences for rumor management and word-of-mouth communications.","David Dubois, Derek D.

The authors argue that arm flexion induces present-biased preferences through activation of approach motivation. The effect of bodily actions on present-biased preferences is regulated by the behavioral approach system (Studies 3 and 4) and relies on the learned association between arm flexion and activation of this approach system (Study 4).

The authors propose that when progress toward attaining a goal is low, consumers are primarily concerned about the question “Can I get there?” Thus, a high (vs. low) perceived velocity in progressing suggests greater expectations of goal attainment, resulting in greater motivation for pursuing the goal. However, when consumers have achieved sufficient progress and are approaching the end point, their attainment of the goal is relatively secured, so they become more concerned about the question “When will I get there?” and focus more on whether they are effectively reducing the remaining discrepancy so that they can attain the goal quickly. In this case, a low (vs. high) perceived velocity in progressing elicits greater motivation because it suggests that continued effort is needed to ensure a speedy attainment.

Using household expenditure survey data from 1984 to 1992, authors examine whether expenditure on fast food is lower in those groups affected by the ban than in those that are not. The authors use a triple difference-indifference methodology by appropriately defining treatment and control groups and find that the ban's effectiveness is not a result of the decrease in fast food expenditures per week but rather of the decrease in purchase propensity by 13% per week. Overall, the authors estimate that the ban reduced fast-food consumption by Us$88 million per year. The study suggests that advertising bans can be effective provided media markets do not overlap.","Tirtha Dhar, Kathy Baylis","advertising regulation, fast food, obesity, difference-in-difference estimator",28,,,,

The authors demonstrate this phenomenon in six experiments involving two methods of inducing relaxation, a large number of products of different types, and various methods of assessing monetary valuation. In all six experiments, participants who were put into a relaxed affective state reported higher monetary valuations than participants who were put into an equally pleasant but less relaxed state. This effect seems to be caused by differences in relaxed and nonrelaxed people's mental construals of the value of the products. Specifically, compared with less relaxed people, relaxed people seem to represent the value of products at a higher level of abstraction, which increases their perceptions of these products' value. The phenomenon appears to reflect an inflation of value by relaxed people rather than a deflation of value by less relaxed people.","Michel Tuan Pham, Iris W. Hung, Gerald J.

The authors predict and find that outcome simulation is more effective than process simulation in increasing product evaluation under a cognitive mode, whereas process simulation is more effective than outcome simulation under an affective mode. Establishing boundary conditions, the authors further show the effect of two important moderators that alter consumers' focus on/away from the product's usage process. Specifically, they show a reversal of the effect for each type of mental simulation for hedonic products, for which product benefits are the more salient aspect (vs. the usage process). Furthermore, a distant-future (vs. near-future) evaluation frame shifts people's focus away from the usage process toward product benefits and reverses the effect of each type of simulation.

More specifically, they investigate how decision processes and preferences change when consumers have a no-choice option versus when they are forced to choose from a given choice set. They propose that the inclusion of a no-choice option in a choice set affects preferences by leading consumers to determine not only which alternative is best, but which, if any, are acceptable (i.e., meet the consumer's minimum needs). Accordingly, the authors demonstrate that the inclusion of a no-choice option in the choice set (1) leads to more alternative- (rather than attribute-) based information processing, (2) increases the importance of attributes that are more meaningful when alternatives are evaluated one by one (i.e., enriched attributes), and (3) increases the importance of attributes with levels that are closer to the consumer's minimum needs (thresholds). They demonstrate that such changes influence consumers' preference structures and ultimate choices.

The results show that, in general, consumers possessing interdependent self-construals prefer donations to a greater extent than those with independent self-construals. However, the findings further indicate that these effects of self-construal are attenuated if (1) the donation-based promotion does not involve a charity that is identity congruent or (2) a cause-congruent identity is more salient than self-construal at the time of decision making. The authors also identify boundary conditions of charity efficiency and product type for these self-construal effects.

First, the method uncovers attributes and attribute dimensions using the “voice of the consumer,” as reflected in customer reviews, rather than that of manufacturers. Second, the approach runs automatically. Third, the process supports rather than supplants managerial judgment by reinforcing or augmenting attributes and dimensions found through traditional surveys and focus groups.

Moreover, relational behavior diminishes financial performance when what is exchanged must be directly comparable in form (i.e., homeomorphic equivalence reciprocity) or returned over a short time horizon (i.e., short-term immediacy reciprocity).

We propose and estimate a Bayesian learning model of tariff and usage choice that explains this flat-rate bias without relying on behavioral misjudgments or tariff-specific preferences. For new products, consumers are uncertain about both their utility relative to the population mean and the mean itself. We show that this latter uncertainty inflates prior variances, which leads consumers to weight their private signals more heavily when updating beliefs. Posteriors are unbiased across products. For a given product, however, the unknown mean yields a “winner's curse”: Consumers with high posteriors tend to overestimate their utility. These consumers choose fixed-rate tariffs and lower their usage as they correct their beliefs. The flat-rate bias arises when switching costs deter them from changing tariffs. Using the estimated model, the authors find that tariff menus are ineffective screening devices for price discrimination by an online grocer. Predicted revenues increase by 20% when the per-use tariff is dropped, because more consumers choose and stay with the flat rate.","Ronald L.

They find that both the estimated brand constants and the price coefficient are biased downward when consumer heterogeneity in choice sets is ignored. These biased estimates can lead firms to make costly price-setting mistakes. In addition, the tracking data enable the authors to identify separately two processes by which advertising influences market shares.

They find that, holding the absolute number of the target customers constant, online category sales are more than 50% higher in locations where customers suffer from preference isolation. Because customers in the preference minority face higher offline shopping costs, they are also less price sensitive. Niche brands, compared with popular brands, show even greater offline-to-online sales substitution. This greater sensitivity to preference isolation means that these brands in the tail of the long tail distribution draw a greater proportion of their total sales from high–preference minority regions.

The authors propose a customer-response model that recognizes the evolvement of customer demand for various products; the possible multifaceted roles of cross-selling solicitations for promotion, advertising, and education; and customer heterogeneous preference for communication channels. They formulate cross-selling campaigns as solutions to a stochastic dynamic programming problem in which the firm's goal is to maximize the long-term profit of its existing customers while taking into account the development of customer demand over time and the multistage role of cross-selling promotion. The model yields optimal cross-selling strategies for how to introduce the right product to the right customer at the right time using the right communication channel. Applying the model to panel data with cross-selling solicitations provided by a national bank, the authors demonstrate that households have different preferences and responsiveness to cross-selling solicitations. In addition to generating immediate sales, cross-selling solicitations also help households move faster along the financial continuum (educational role) and build up goodwill (advertising role). A decomposition analysis shows that the educational effect (83%) largely dominates the advertising effect (15%) and instantaneous promotional effect (2%).

When the difficulty experienced during decisions later in the process deviates from that which occurs earlier in the process, consumer preference is affected by the discrepancy between actual and expected difficulty. Specifically, the results show that when the difficulty experienced during feature decisions deviates from expectations, consumers may spend more or less money on product features as a result of discrepant fluency than when they perform the same task and the level of difficulty is expected. The results demonstrate that discrepant fluency effects are not limited to sequential decisions but can influence a single feature decision, which was accomplished by altering consumers’ expectations before the decision. These discrepant fluency effects emerge even when the attributes of the alternatives and the composition of the focal decision settings remain the same.","Keith Wilcox, Sangyoung Song","fluency, customization, decision framing, sequential choice, expectations",,,,,
The Influence of Friends on Consumer Spending: The Role of Agency–Communion Orientation and Self-Monitoring,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.4.741,01-Aug-11,01-Aug,2011,48,4,741,754,"Four studies investigate the interactive influence of the presence of an accompanying friend and a consumer's agency–communion orientation on the consumer's spending behaviors. In general, the authors find that shopping with a friend can be expensive for agency-oriented consumers (e.g., males) but not for communion-oriented consumers (e.g., females). That is, consumers who are agency oriented spend significantly more when they shop with a friend (vs. when they shop alone), whereas this effect is attenuated for consumers who are communion oriented. The results also show that this interactive effect is moderated by individual differences in self-monitoring such that friends are especially influential for consumers who are high in self-monitoring, but the effects occur in opposite directions for agency- and communion-oriented consumers (i.e., agentic consumers spend more with a friend, while communal consumers spend less when accompanied by a friend). Finally, the authors test the underlying process and document that the interaction of agency–communion orientation, the presence of a friend, and self-monitoring is reversed when the focal context is changed from “spending for the self” to “donating to a charity.” They conclude with a discussion of implications for research and practice.","Didem Kurt, J.

Multiple Routes to Self- versus Other-Expression in Consumer Choice,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.4.755,01-Aug-11,01-Aug,2011,48,4,755,766,"Studies of consumer decision making often begin with the identification of a dimension on which options differ, followed by an analysis of the factors that influence preferences along that dimension. Building on a conceptual analysis of a diverse set of problems, the authors identify a class of related consumers choices (e.g., extreme vs. compromise, hedonic vs. utilitarian, risky vs. safe) that can all be classified according to their levels of self- versus other-expression (or [un]conventionality). As shown in four studies, these problem types respond similarly to manipulations that trigger or suppress self-expression. Specifically, priming self-expression systematically increases the share of the self-expressive options across choice problems. Conversely, expecting to be evaluated decreases the share of the self-expressive options across the various choice dilemmas. In addition, priming risk seeking increases only the choice of risky gambles but not of other self-expressive options. These findings highlight the importance of seeking underlying shared features across different consumer choice problems, instead of treating each type in isolation.","Michal Maimaran, Itamar Simonson","choice, self-expression, other-expression",,,,,
Incorporating Context Effects into a Choice Model,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.4.767,16-Oct-18,01-Aug,2011,48,4,767,780,"The behavioral literature provides ample evidence that consumer preferences are partly driven by the context provided by the set of alternatives. Three important context effects are the compromise, attraction, and similarity effects. Because these context effects affect choices in a systematic and predictable way, it should be possible to incorporate them in a choice model. However, the literature does not offer such a choice model. This study fills this gap by proposing a discrete-choice model that decomposes a product's utility into a context-free partworth utility and a context-dependent component capturing all three context effects. Model estimation results on choice-based conjoint data involving digital cameras provide convincing statistical evidence for context effects. The estimated context effects are consistent with the predictions from the behavioral literature, and accounting for context effects leads to better predictions both in and out of sample. To illustrate the benefit from incorporating context effects in a choice model, the authors discuss how firms could utilize the context sensitivity of consumers to design more profitable product lines.","Robert P.

The authors use data on individual salesperson compensation contracts to show that firms design their pay plans to both discriminatingly select (i.e., attract and retain) salespeople and provide them with the right level of incentives. Consistent with standard agency arguments, the authors find that firms use higher-powered incentives as the importance of agent effort increases. At the same time, the authors find strong support for the selection role of these contracts. Specifically, agents with greater selling ability and lower risk aversion are associated with jobs offering higher-powered incentives. Finally, consistent with prior findings on incentive contracts, the authors find no support for the insurance implication of the typical agency model. The authors rule out alternative explanations for this anomalous result and find that the selection role of contracts best explains the result in their context.","Desmond (HO-FU) Lo, Mrinal Ghosh, Francine Lafontaine","sales force compensation, agency theory, incentives, selection, retention, survey research",,,,,

These results are contrary to the predictions of several prominent theoretical perspectives and a convenience sample of practitioners. The reduction in perceived vulnerability to breast cancer following gender identity primes can be eliminated by self-affirmation (Experiment 3a) and fear voicing (Experiment 3b), corroborating the hypothesis that these effects are driven by unconscious defense mechanisms.","Stefano Puntoni, Steven Sweldens, Nader T.

The authors model the adoption decision of individuals as a binary choice affected by three factors: (1) the local network structure formed by already adopted neighbors, (2) the average characteristics of adopted neighbors (influencers), and (3) the characteristics of the potential adopters. Focusing on the first factor, the authors find two marked effects. First, an individual who is connected to many adopters has a greater adoption probability (degree effect). Second, the density of connections in a group of already adopted consumers has a strong positive effect on the adoption of individuals connected to this group (clustering effect). The article also records significant effects for influencer and adopter characteristics. For adopters, specifically, the authors find that position in the entire network and some demographic variables are good predictors of adoption. Similarly, in the case of already adopted individuals, average demographics and global network position can predict their influential power on their neighbors. An interesting counterintuitive finding is that the average influential power of individuals decreases with the total number of their contacts. These results have practical implications for viral marketing, a context in which a variety of technology platforms are increasingly considering leveraging their consumers' revealed connection patterns. The model performs particularly well in predicting the next set of adopters.","Zsolt Katona, Peter Pal Zubcsek, Miklos Sarvary","diffusion, social networks, network marketing",6,,,,

First, they model the arrival of product ratings and separate the effects of social influences from the underlying (or baseline) ratings behavior. Second, the authors model product sales as a function of posted product ratings while decomposing ratings into a baseline rating, the contribution of social influence, and idiosyncratic error. This enables them to quantify the sales impact of observed social dynamics. The authors consider both the direct effects on sales and the indirect effects that result from the influence of dynamics on future ratings (and thus future sales). The results show that although ratings behavior is significantly influenced by previously posted ratings and can directly improve sales, the effects are relatively short lived once indirect effects are considered.","Wendy W.

The most important are as follows: the average short-term advertising elasticity is .12, which is substantially lower than the prior meta-analytic mean of .22; there has been a decline in the advertising elasticity over time; and advertising elasticity is higher (1) for durable goods than nondurable goods, (2) in the early stage than the mature stage of the life cycle, (3) for yearly data than quarterly data, and (4) when advertising is measured in gross rating points than monetary terms.

This is an important, substantive finding that persisted over a significant time span. in addition, in two additional laboratory studies, they find further evidence for this matching hypothesis, in which a pairing of loss- (gain-) framed messages that activates more concrete (abstract) mind-sets leads to enhanced processing fluency, increased efficacy, and, as a result, more positive recycling intentions.

Drawing on research on psychological distance and the “fit” literature, the authors hypothesize that others' recommendations are more persuasive when the construal levels associated with both social distance and temporal distance are congruent.

Second, contrary to conventional wisdom, the authors find that close others do not always have a greater impact than distant others. instead, recommendations from close others are more influential in shifting near-future preferences than those from distant others, whereas recommendations from distant others are more influential than those from close others in shifting distant-future preferences (Study 3). The authors demonstrate that others' recommendations are perceived to be more relevant as the underlying mechanism when there is a match of construal levels between the social and temporal distance.

To measure consumer preferences for new product concepts, the authors apply a “securities trading of concepts,” or STOC, approach, in which new product concepts are traded as financial securities. The authors apply this method because market prices are known to efficiently collect and aggregate private information regarding the economic value of goods, services, and firms, particularly when trading financial securities. This research compares the STOC approach against stated-choice, conjoint, constant-sum, and longitudinal revealed-preference data. The authors also place STOC in the context of previous research on prediction markets and experimental economics. Across multiple product categories, the authors test whether STOC (1) is more cost efficient than other methods, (2) passes validity tests, (3) measures expectations of others, and (4) reveals individual preferences, not just those of the crowd. The results show that traders exhibit a self-preference bias when trading. Ultimately, STOC offers two key advantages over traditional market research methods: cost efficiency and scalability.

Previous research has found that general brand effects influence a brand's scores on specific image dimensions. To investigate the value of general versus specific brand image, the authors specify a higher-order factor model in which a set of correlated factor scores arise from a general brand factor and a set of orthogonal residual scores that measure the specific dimensions of brand image. The general brand factor is consistent with the concept of a halo effect, which theory ascribes to either an overall evaluative effect or errors in cognition. The authors apply the model to stated preference data on branded midsized sedans accompanied by data on consumer brand-image associations. The authors find that there is substantial value for the specific dimensions of brand image, but only after controlling for the general brand effect with the higher-order factor decomposition.","Garrett Sonnier, Andrew Ainslie","choice models, factor models, Bayesian methods",,,,,

Two studies using a delay-of-gratification paradigm demonstrate this forward-looking thinking and show it to be a mindful process. Participants in positive (vs. neutral) affect were more likely to choose a larger mail-in rebate over a smaller instant rebate when the reward differences were moderate (but not when they were small). Two studies demonstrate the impact of positive affect on intertemporal preference in another way, showing that participants in positive affect do not discount the value of delayed outcomes as much as people in neutral affect do (decreased present bias). Together, the results indicate that positive affect promotes cognitive flexibility and fosters a higher level of thinking and a more future-oriented time perspective, without obscuring practical considerations and other needed detail, including context and opportunity costs, when evaluating intertemporal options.","Jin Seok Pyone, Alice M.

Furthermore, the authors examine when impression management concerns increase consumers' likelihood of choosing feature-rich products. They find that public choices in which participants display their preferences to others encourage feature-seeking behavior but that the anticipation of having to use a product in front of others provides an incentive to avoid additional features.","Debora V.

The authors consider a game-theoretic model in which firms compete for advertising positions and then compete in price for customers in a product market. Firms differ in their competence, and positions are differentiated in their prominence, which reflects consumers' online search behavior. They find that when endogenously evaluated within the product market competition, a prominent advertising position might not always be desirable for a firm with competitive advantage, even if it is cost-free. The profitability of a prominent advertising position depends on the trade-off between the extra demand from winning the position and the higher equilibrium prices when the weaker competitor wins it. Furthermore, the authors show that the bidding outcome might not align with the relative competitive strength, and an advantaged firm might not be able to win the prominent position even when it values that position. They derive two-dimensional equilibrium price dispersion with the realized prices at the same position varying and the expected prices differing across different positions. They find that the expected price in the prominent position might not always be higher, implying that an expensive location does not necessarily lead to expensive products.","Lizhen Xu, Jianqing Chen, Andrew Whinston","price competition, endogenous valuation, search advertising, online search, price dispersion, bidding incentive",,,,,
Effects of Customer and Innovation Asset Configuration Strategies on Firm Performance,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.3.587,01-Jun-11,01-Jun,2011,48,3,587,602,"Both customer and innovation assets are important to firm performance.

Empirical results from two studies—one using secondary data and another using primary data from a survey of senior managers—indicate that performance is highest when firms employ configurations using deep customer and broad innovation assets or deep innovation and broad customer assets.

The authors demonstrate that this effect holds in a single-offering, single-reviewer context. The authors also show that when consumers are exposed to multiple offerings with multiple reviewers, there may be a slight “cost” to ambiguity as opposed to similarity but that ambiguity remains much more persuasive than dissimilarity.

The results show that people are 8% less likely to say that they will purchase an alcoholic beverage in states that have alcohol advertising bans compared with states that do not. For consumers exposed to online advertising, this gap narrows to 3%. There are similar effects for four changes in local offline alcohol advertising restrictions when advertising effectiveness is observed both before and after the change. The effect of online advertising is disproportionately high for new products and for products with low awareness in places that have bans. This suggests that online advertising could reduce the effectiveness of attempts to regulate offline advertising channels because online advertising substitutes for (rather than complements) offline advertising.","Avi Goldfarb, Catherine Tucker","advertising, regulation, advertising media mix, Internet",15,,,,

The authors propose that the intrapersonal conflict that is evoked by choices involving incompatible goals can be resolved through scope-insensitive justifications. The authors describe one such mechanism, the “mere token” effect, a new phenomenon in decision making. They demonstrate that adding a certain and immediate mere token amount to both options increases choices of the later-larger option in intertemporal choice and of the riskier-larger option in risky choice. The authors find this effect to be scope insensitive, such that the size of the token amount does not moderate the effect. They show that intrapersonal choice conflict underlies the mere token effect and that reducing the degree of conflict by increasing the psychological distance to the choice outcomes debiases the effect. Moreover, they show that the mere token effect is enhanced when (1) opposing goals in choice are made salient and (2) the choice options represent a starker contrast that generates greater conflict. The authors empirically rule out alternative explanations, including diminishing marginal utility, normative and descriptive utility-based models, liquidity constraints, and naive diversification.

How Asking “Who am I?” Affects what Consumers Buy: The Influence of Self-Discovery on Consumption,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.2.296,01-Apr-11,01-Apr,2011,48,2,296,307,"Are you type A or type B? An optimist or a pessimist? Intuitive or analytical? Consumers are motivated to learn about the self, but they may not always accept what they learn. This article explores how the desire for self-discovery leads people to seek but not necessarily accept the feedback they receive and the implications this has for consumption behavior. Specifically, this article examines the case of consumers who value being unconstrained: people with independent self-construals and those who have high levels of reactance motivation. The authors argue that these people often view self-knowledge as a constraint on the self and subsequently reject it—even when the self-knowledge has neutral or positive implications for self-esteem. Results across five studies demonstrate that independents and high reactants feel constrained by self-knowledge, and this causes them to reject and make consumption choices inconsistent with it even as they actively seek to learn about themselves. In contrast, interdependents and low reactants do not feel constrained by self-knowledge, and consequently, they accept and incorporate it into their consumption decisions.","Eugenia C. Wu, Keisha M.

The current research investigates a diametrically opposed process, whereby consumers complicate their decisions. The authors demonstrate that to complicate their choices, consumers increase choice conflict by overweighting small disadvantages of superior alternatives, converging overall evaluations of alternatives, reversing preference ordering, and even choosing less preferred alternatives. Furthermore, the results from five studies support a unifying theoretical framework: the effort–compatibility principle. Specifically, the authors argue that consumers strive for compatibility between the effort they anticipate and the effort that they actually exert. When a decision seems more difficult than initially expected, a simplifying process ensues. However, when the decision seems easier to resolve than anticipated (e.g., when consumers face an important yet easy choice), consumers artificially increase their effort.","Rom Y.

The Sources and Consequences of the Fluent Processing of Numbers,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.2.327,01-Apr-11,01-Apr,2011,48,2,327,341,"Consumers often like fluently processed stimuli.

Common addition and multiplication problems (arithmetic), or their operands, can be used to prime a number and increase its fluency (study 3). The benefits of arithmetic and operand primes are limited to single primes (i.e., more primes are not necessarily better) (Study 5).

Inventory shortages can have adverse consequences on both short- and long-term customer behaviors. Using data from an online grocer, this study has the following three main objectives: First, the authors empirically investigate the true nature of shortage costs by examining how stockouts and fulfillment rates affect customer's purchase behavior in both the short and long run. Second, the authors study how consumers’ reactions to inventory shortages differ across customer segments. They use these observations to illustrate how the seller might benefit from prioritizing fulfillment policies according to customer traits. Third, the authors study how the impact of inventory shortages varies across product categories. Using these insights, the authors discuss how the seller should allocate limited resources to improve order fulfillment across these categories. Overall, the authors find that stockout rates have a dramatic but nonlinear impact on the seller's profitability. This suggests that the firm can achieve many of the benefits of improving fulfillment rates through small decreases in stockout rates. They also find significant differences in how different types of customers respond to stockouts and that prioritizing inventory according to transaction history measures and basket contents can lead to large increases in contribution while only requiring moderate reductions in stockout rates.","Xiaoqing Jing, Michael Lewis","customer relationship management, customer lifetime value, yield management, customization, stockouts",,,,,

Four studies show the deliberate consideration of price anchors that can play a key role in whether the effect of the anchors will generalize across product categories. Specifically, an explicit comparison of a product to a price anchor increases the accessibility of features that represent a product available at this price. In turn, these thoughts influence the price that consumers are willing to pay for these products.

Three experiments examine the effects of self-focused attention on the use of this criterion and the conditions in which it is applied. When features of the judgment (social or nonsocial) context are similar to those of the situation in which the products are normally used, self-focused attention increases participants’ disposition to imagine themselves using the products they evaluate, and in turn, these imaginings increase both their evaluations of these products and their likelihood of choosing these products as a gift for taking part in the experiment. The effects occur when features of the judgment context are manipulated both by incidental background music and by the presence of others in the situation at hand. However, when either self-focused attention is low or features of the judgment context are dissimilar to those in which the products are normally used, these effects are not apparent.","Iris W.

Self-Regulatory Strength and Consumers’ Relinquishment of Decision Control: When Less Effortful Decisions Are More Resource Depleting,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.2.403,01-Apr-11,01-Apr,2011,48,2,403,412,"Using the self-regulatory strength model and prior research on self-esteem threats, the authors predict and show that delegating decisions to surrogates (e.g., financial advisors, physicians) depletes consumers’ limited self-regulatory resources more than making the same decisions independently, thus impairing their subsequent ability to exercise self-control. This is the case even though decision delegation actually requires less decision-making effort than independent decision making (Study 1). However, the resource-depleting effect of decision delegation vanishes when consumers have an opportunity to affirm their belief in free will (Study 2). Moreover, when people remember a past decision that they delegated, their self-control is impaired more than when they remember a decision made independently (Studies 3 and 4).

Experiment 2 demonstrates that this misunderstanding leads to underestimates of the cost of waiting to save, which makes putting off saving more attractive than it should be. Finally, Experiments 3–5 show that highlighting the exponential growth of savings motivates both college students and employees to save more for retirement.

To experimentally examine how consumers manage multiple debts, the authors develop an incentive-compatible debt management game, in which participants are saddled with multiple debts and need to decide how to repay them over time. Consistent with the hypothesis, four experiments reveal evidence of debt account aversion: Participants consistently pay off small debts first, even though the larger debts have higher interest rates. The authors also find that restricting participants’ ability to completely pay off small debts, and focusing their attention on the amount of interest each debt has accumulated, helps them reduce overall debt more quickly.","Moty Amar, Dan Ariely, Shahar Ayal,...","financial decision making, debt repayment, debt consolidation, goals, credit cards",6,,,,

Experimental evidence from U.S. consumers shows that consumers’ propensity to pay the minimum required each month moderates these effects; U.K. credit card field data indicate that borrowers’ credit limit and balance due also moderate these effects. However, increasing the minimum level is unlikely to completely eliminate the negative effect of presenting minimum payment information. In addition, disclosing supplemental information, such as future interest cost and time needed to repay the loan, does not reduce the negative effects of including minimum payment information and has no substantial positive effect on repayments.

However, many people strongly dislike paying taxes. Although this distaste could be rational on economic grounds, the authors show that this attitude extends beyond simply disliking the costs incurred and affects behavior in coun-ternormative ways. They demonstrate the phenomenon of tax aversion: a desire to avoid taxes per se that exceeds the rational economic motivation to avoid a monetary cost. Across five experiments, the authors provide evidence that people have a stronger preference to avoid tax-related costs than to avoid equal-sized (or larger) monetary costs unrelated to taxes. Tax aversion affects consumer preferences in a variety of domains, including standard store purchases, financial investments, and job selection. Furthermore, this tendency is most prevalent among people who identify with political parties that generally favor less taxation. Finally, encouraging participants who identify with “antitax” parties to consider positive uses of their tax payments mitigates tax aversion.

Investors are disappointed when they sell a stock for a loss and regret having ever purchased the stock; these negative emotions deter investors from later repurchasing stocks they sold for a loss. Having sold a stock, investors are disappointed if the stock continues to rise and regret having sold the stock in the first place; these negative emotions deter investors from repurchasing stocks that go up since being sold. Thus, investors engage in reinforcement learning by repurchasing stocks whose previous purchase resulted in positive emotions and avoiding stocks whose previous purchase resulted in negative emotions.","Michal Ann Strahilevitz, Terrance Odean, Brad M.

Fear leads to early sell-off when parti-pant believe the value of the stock is peer generated but not when they believe the value of the stock is computer generated (Experiment 2). Early sell-off as a result of incidental fear also occurs when participants believe their risk attitude is common in the market but not when they believe their risk attitude is unique (Experiment 3).

As the number of identity claims in narratives increases, so does loan funding, whereas loan performance suffers, because these borrowers are less likely to pay back the loan. In addition, identity content plays an important role. Identities focused on being trustworthy or successful are associated with increased loan funding but ironically are less predictive of loan performance than other identities (i.e., moral and economic hardship).

In addition, a series of experiments show that people recognize when they could benefit from a second opinion but are more reluctant to do so when thinking about their own providers rather than someone else's.

The proposed method defines a product search network, consisting of the products and links that designate whether a product is searched conditional on searching other products. The authors model this network using a stochastic, hierarchical, and asymmetric multidimensional scaling framework and decompose the product locations as well as the product-level influences using product attributes. The advantages of the approach are twofold. First, the authors simultaneously visualize the positions of products and the direction of consumer search over products in a perceptual map of search proximity. Second, they explain the formation of the map using observed product attributes.

The authors demonstrate that when an individual-level trial hazard model is properly specified to account for potential sources of biases, substantial contagion effects may be detected in the diffusion of many CPGs. Using longitudinal panel data on individual-level trial and repeat purchases of 67 newly introduced CPGs, they show that standard diffusion models fail to detect contagion. However, after extending the model to allow for spatial and temporal heterogeneity in contagion and controlling for various cross-sectional and temporal confounds, they find statistically significant contagion effects in 33 to 40 of the 67 sample products. The empirical evidence of contagion in the diffusion of many CPGs has important implications because most new product trial models for CPGs have assumed a priori that there is no contagion in the diffusion of these products. Moreover, the individual-level simultaneous analysis of the diffusion of 67 newly introduced CPGs provides useful insights into the unobservable network of influences among consumers. Such analysis allows a vendor to identify the most influential early adopters among its customers, who could help diffuse a new product more effectively in the market.","Rex Yuxing Du, Wagner A.

They derive a perfect Bayesian Nash equilibrium and show that whereas higher current period prices induce search, consumers who observe higher historical prices form higher price expectations, become more pessimistic, and search less. Furthermore, the authors show that when prices increase as a result of an increase in marginal costs, consumers respond by searching more, which then leads to higher prices and instant price adjustment.

When Trade-Offs Matter: The Effect of Choice Construal on Context Effects,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.1.62,01-Feb-11,01-Feb,2011,48,1,62,71,"Everyday decisions present consumers with several trade-offs. In turn, these trade-offs can influence the decision outcome. The authors show that the level at which people construe a choice can affect trade-off making, such that a high construal of a choice decreases comparative trade-offs relative to a low construal. They use six studies to illustrate the idea in three important trade-off-relevant context effects. The results show that a high (versus a low) construal decreases the compromise and background-contrast effects and increases the attraction effect by reducing attribute-level trade-offs.","Uzma Khan, Meng Zhu, Ajay Kalra","context effects, construal levels, mind-sets, preference construction, trade-offs",,,,,
Learning and Acting on Customer Information: A Simulation-Based Demonstration on Service Allocations with Offshore Centers,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.1.72,02-Oct-18,01-Feb,2011,48,1,72,86,"As service centers become crucial corporate assets for increasing customer relationships and profits, it is imperative to understand customer reactions to service allocations. Using customer call history from a DSL service, the authors empirically investigate how customers’ onshore and offshore experiences affect service duration and customer retention. They formulate service channel allocation decisions as solutions to a dynamic programming problem in which the firm learns about heterogeneous customer preferences, balances short-term service costs with long-term customer retention, and optimally matches customers with their preferred centers to maximize long-term profit. They demonstrate through simulations that learning enables a firm to make more customized allocations and that acting on long-term customer responses prompts the firm to make proactive decisions that prevent customers from leaving. As a result, the firm can improve customer retention and profit. The proposed framework also mirrors the recent trend of companies seeking solutions that transform customer information into customized and dynamic marketing decisions to improve long-term profit.","Baohong Sun, Li Shibo","service allocation, customer retention, customer lifetime value, stochastic dynamic optimization, firm decision support system",,,,,
From Generic to Branded: A Model of Spillover in Paid Search Advertising,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.1.87,01-Feb-11,01-Feb,2011,48,1,87,102,"In Internet paid search advertising, marketers pay for search engines to serve text advertisements in response to keyword searches that are generic (e.g., “hotels”) or branded (e.g., “Hilton Hotels”). Although standalone metrics usually show that generic keywords have higher apparent costs to the advertiser than branded keywords, generic search may create a spillover effect on subsequent branded search. Building on the Nerlove–Arrow advertising framework, the authors propose a dynamic linear model to capture the potential spillover from generic to branded paid search. In the model, generic search advertisements serve to expose users to information about the brand's ability to meet their needs, raising awareness that the brand is relevant to the search. In turn, this can induce additional future search activity for keywords that include the brand name. Using a Bayesian estimation approach, the authors apply the model to data from a paid search campaign for a major lodging chain. The results show that generic search activity positively affects future branded search activity through awareness of relevance. However, branded search does not affect generic search, demonstrating that the spillover is asymmetric. The findings have implications for understanding search behavior on the Internet and the management of paid search advertising.","Oliver J. Rutz, Randolph E.

They manipulated several factors within the gift treatment: gift type, the accompanying message, and the sequence of gift value, which improved ($35 then $100 gift), worsened ($100 then $35 gift), or was a single gift. A highly detrimental effect of decreasing gift value occurred on deposit balances. This “deterioration aversion” persisted in a long-term follow-up analysis of deposit balances.

The authors find that UDE predicts consideration sets better, across both profiles and respondents, than a structured direct-elicitation method. It predicts comparably to established incentive-aligned compensatory, noncompensatory, and mixed decompositional methods. In a more complex automotive study, noncompensatory decomposition is not feasible and additive-utility decomposition is strained, but UDE scales well.

Product Line Design for Consumer Durables: An Integrated Marketing and Engineering Approach,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.1.128,01-Feb-11,01-Feb,2011,48,1,128,139,"Product line design for consumer durables often relies on close coordination between marketing and engineering domains. Product lines that evolve as optimal from marketers’ perspective may not be optimal from an engineering viewpoint, and vice versa. Although extant research has proposed sophisticated techniques to handle problems that characterize each individual domain, the majority of these developments have not addressed the interdependent issues across marketing and engineering. The author presents a product line optimization method that enables managers to simultaneously consider factors deemed important from both marketing and engineering domains. One major advantage of this method is that it takes into account the strategic reactions from the incumbent manufacturers and the retailer in the design of the product line. The author demonstrates in a simulation study that this method is applicable to problems with a reasonably large scale. Using data collected in a power tool development project undertaken by a major U.S. manufacturer, the study illustrates that the proposed method leads to a more profitable product line than alternative approaches that consider requirements from these two domains separately.",Lan Luo,"product line, product design, marketing engineering integration, optimization methods, genetic algorithm",,,,,

The proposed approach overcomes some of the limitations of previous self-explicated approaches. The authors develop a computer-based self-explicated approach that breaks down the attribute importance question into a ranking of attributes followed by a sequence of constant-sum paired comparison questions. In the proposed approach, the questions are chosen adaptively for each respondent to maximize the information elicited from each paired comparison question. Unlike the traditional self-explicated approach, the proposed approach provides standard errors for attribute importance. In two studies involving digital cameras and laptop computers described on 12 and 14 attributes, respectively, the authors find that the ability to correctly predict validation choices of the proposed adaptive approach is substantially and significantly greater than that of adaptive conjoint analysis, the fast polyhedral method, and the traditional self-explicated approach. In addition, the adaptive self-explicated approach yields a significantly higher predictive validity than a nonadaptive fractional factorial constant-sum paired comparison design.","Oded Netzer, V.

More or Less: A Model and Empirical Evidence on Preferences for Under- and Overpayment in Trade-In Transactions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.1.157,01-Feb-11,01-Feb,2011,48,1,157,171,"Trade-in transactions typically involve an exchange of an old, used version for a new or newer version of the product. When consumers trade in their used model for a new model, the firm faces the choice of paying the consumer a relatively low price for the used model and charging a commensurately low price for the new model or paying a relatively high price for the used model and charging a commensurately high price for the new model. The extant literature suggests that consumers always prefer to be overpaid in trade-in transactions because they disproportionately value the gain associated with the revenues from the sale of the used version of the product. The authors draw from the prospect theory value function to develop a simple analytical model that identifies a condition under which this preference for overpayment is reversed. Their model predicts that even when faced with economically equivalent price formats, consumers prefer to be overpaid when the ratio of the price of their used product to the price of the new product is low, but when that ratio is high, the preference for overpayment is reversed. They observe support for the predictions that emerge from the model in laboratory experiments.","Jungkeun Kim, Raghunath Singh Rao, Kyeongheui Kim,...","trade-ins, behavioral decision theory, analytical models, consumer behavior, pricing",3,,,,

The authors propose that this preference does not hold for vice food, because consumers cannot generate good justifications for buying such food when a bonus pack is offered because this would mean consuming more of the vice. However, a price discount on a vice food can be justified because it acts as a guilt-mitigating mechanism. For virtue foods, the absence of both anticipated postconsumption guilt and the resultant need to justify leads consumers to prefer a bonus pack to a price discount.

The authors offer a methodology for predicting the magnitude of these losses for specific store closures that outperforms models calibrated on observed “regular” shopping patterns.

These effects are stronger when product market competition is high and financial market uncertainty is large. In addition, analyst recommendations at least partially mediate the effects of changes in satisfaction on firm abnormal return, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk. Analyst recommendations represent a mechanism through which customer satisfaction affects firm value. Thus, if analysts pay attention to Main Street customer satisfaction, Wall Street investors should have good reason to listen and follow.

However, in the context of special-occasion products, for which consumers value exclusivity, metacognitive difficulty increases the attractiveness of a product by making it appear unique or uncommon.

Using brand choice models that accommodate context (compromise, similarity, and attraction) effects, the authors find that both economy and premium PLs cannibalize incumbent PLs. Economy PL introductions benefit mainstream-quality NBs because these NBs become a compromise or middle option in terms of quality in the retailer's assortment. The effects of premium PL introductions on premium-quality NBs are mixed: Their share improves in two of four cases but decreases in the other two cases.","Inge Geyskens, Katrijn Gielens, Els Gijsbrechts","private labels, context effects, retailing, store brands, product assortment",,,,,
Cumulative Timed Intent: A New Predictive Tool for Technology Adoption,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.5.808,01-Oct-10,01-Oct,2010,47,5,808,822,"Despite multiple calls for the integration of time into behavioral intent measurement, surprisingly little academic research has examined timed intent measures directly. In two empirical studies, the authors estimate individual-level cumulative adoption likelihood curves—curves calibrated on self-reported adoption likelihoods for cumulative time intervals across a fixed horizon—of 478 managerial decision makers, self-predicting whether and when they will adopt a relevant technology. A hierarchical Bayes formulation allows for a heterogeneous account of the individual-level adoption likelihood curves as a function of time and common antecedents of technology adoption. A third study generalizes these results among 354 consumer decision makers and, using behavioral data collected during a two-year longitudinal study involving a subsample of 143 consumer decision makers, provides empirical evidence for the accuracy of cumulative adoption likelihood curves for predicting whether and when a technology is adopted. Cumulative adoption likelihood curves outperform two single-intent measures as well as two widely validated intent models in predicting individual-level adoption for a fixed period of two years. The results hold great promise for further research on using and optimizing cumulative timed intent measures across a variety of application domains.","Koert Van Ittersum, Fred M.

How Important Are Brands?

Although brand equity measures for specific brands have attracted a large body of literature, the questions of how important brands are within an entire product category and the extent to which BRiC differs across categories and countries have been neglected. The authors introduce the concept of BRiC (a category-level measure, not a brand-level measure). They develop a conceptual framework to measure BRiC and the drivers of BRiC, test the framework empirically with a sample of more than 5700 consumers, and show how the construct varies across 20 product categories and five countries (France, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). The results suggest a high validity of the proposed BRiC measure and show substantial differences between categories and countries. A replication study two-and-a-half years later confirms the psychometric properties of the suggested scale and shows remarkable stability of the findings.

The authors conduct a meta-analysis of 506 personal selling elasticity estimates drawn from analyses of 88 empirical data sets across 75 previous articles. They find a mean estimate of current-period personal selling elasticity of .34. They also find that elasticity estimates are higher for early life-cycle-stage offerings, higher from studies set in Europe than from those set in the United States, and smaller in more recent years. In addition, elasticity estimates are affected significantly by analysts’ use of relative rather than absolute sales output measures, by cross-sectional rather than panel data, by omission of promotions, by lagged effects, by marketing interaction effects, and by the neglect of endogeneity in model estimation. The method bias–corrected mean personal selling elasticity is approximately .31. The authors discuss the implications of their results for sales managers and researchers.","Sönke Albers, Murali K.

The “Right” Consumers for Better Concepts: Identifying Consumers High in Emergent Nature to Develop New Product Concepts,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.5.854,01-Oct-10,01-Oct,2010,47,5,854,865,"While much research has emphasized improving current new product concept techniques, little work has focused on trait-based approaches that specify which consumers are the “right” ones to use in the new product development process, particularly in the consumer goods industry.

The authors draw on research on personality theory and information-processing styles to support their conceptualization and develop and validate a highly reliable scale to measure emergent nature (Study 1). In subsequent multipart studies, they show in both group (Studies 2a–2c) and individual (Studies 3a and 3b) settings across two distinct product categories that consumers high in emergent nature are able to develop product concepts that mainstream consumers find significantly more appealing and useful than concepts developed by typical, lead user, or even innovative consumers.","Donna L.

Thus, little guidance is available to firms regarding the relative efficacy of their various marketing expenditures over the long run. To investigate this issue, the authors apply a multivariate dynamic linear transfer function model to five years of advertising and scanner data for 25 product categories and 70 brands in France. The findings indicate that the total (short-term plus long-term) sales elasticity is 1.37 for product and .74 for distribution. Conversely, the total elasticities for advertising and discounting are only .13 and .04, respectively. This result stands in marked contrast to the previous emphasis in the literature on price promotions and advertising. The authors further find that the long-term effects of discounting are one-third the magnitude of the short-term effects. The ratio is reversed from other aspects of the mix (in which long-term effects exceed four times the short-term effects), underscoring the strategic role of these tools in brand sales.","M.

Posterior Predictive Model Checking: An Application to Multivariate Normal Heterogeneity,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.5.896,01-Oct-10,01-Oct,2010,47,5,896,909,"Analysts fitting a hierarchical Bayesian model must specify the distribution of heterogeneity. There are several distributions to choose from, including the multivariate normal, mixture of normals, Dirichlet processes priors, and so forth. Although significant progress has been made, estimating the models and obtaining measures for model selection remain ongoing areas of research for more flexible distributions of heterogeneity. As a result, the multivariate normal remains the default choice for many researchers and software packages. This article proposes model-checking statistics that signal the adequacy of the multivariate normal assumption for the distribution of heterogeneity; these methods do not require the analyst to fit alternative models. The authors use posterior predictive model checking to determine whether a discrepancy exists between the individual-level parameters and those implied by the assumed distribution of heterogeneity. In simulated and real data sets, the results show that these statistics are useful for identifying when the multivariate normal distribution is adequate, when there is a departure in the tails of the distribution, and when a multimodal distribution of heterogeneity may be more appropriate.","Timothy J.

Self-awareness cues tend to increase customers’ satisfaction when the outcome of a service interaction is unfavorable, but they tend to decrease customers’ satisfaction when the outcome of the interaction is favorable. This is because higher self-awareness increases customers’ tendency to attribute outcomes to themselves rather than to the provider. Self-awareness can even influence satisfaction with service interactions that occurred far in the past. The authors demonstrate these effects across a variety of lab and field settings with different simulated retail experiences and with different real-life service interactions, including college courses, meals taken at a university cafeteria, and items purchased at an actual clothing store. The results further show that attempts to shape customers’ satisfaction by means of self-awareness are more likely to be effective when there is substantial customer responsibility for the outcome; when customers’ responsibility is limited, such attempts may backfire.","Michel Tuan Pham, Caroline Goukens, Donald R.

Thus, orientation matching results in emotional benefit, increases preferences toward matched outcomes, and frees resources for subsequent tasks.","Aparna A. Labroo, Derek D.

Adopting the view that customer satisfaction is a stochastic marketplace asset, the authors advance a mean-variance perspective that enables them to test two conjectures: (1) Objective service quality and advertising affect not only the level of customer satisfaction but also the heterogeneity in customer satisfaction, and (2) shareholder value is shaped by the interplay of satisfaction level and heterogeneity, through their impact on retention sales, acquisition sales, and servicing costs. The authors test these conjectures using secondary data from diverse sources that describe the dynamics in the U.S. airlines industry during a nine-year period (1997–2005). The results, derived from estimating structural models that account for the impact of several meaningful control variables, provide strong support for both conjectures. Importantly, the findings indicate that the return on satisfaction to shareholder value decreases by almost 70% in going from low to high satisfaction heterogeneity; at the same time, increasing levels of satisfaction heterogeneity serves to reduce the volatility in shareholder value.","Rajdeep Grewal, Murali Chandrashekaran, Alka V.

This research investigates how data on prior advertising expenditures and sales outcomes are used in budget allocation decisions and attempts to answer three important questions about data-based inferences. First, do biases exist that are strong enough to lead to seriously suboptimal decisions? Second, do graphical data displays, real-world experience, or explicit training reduce any observed biases? Third, are the observed biases well explained by a relatively small set of natural heuristics that managers use when making data-based allocation decisions? The results suggest answers of yes, no, and yes, respectively. The authors identify three broad classes of heuristics: difference-based (which assess causation by comparing adjacent changes in expenditures to changes in sales), trend-based (which assess causation by comparing overall trends in expenditures and sales), and exemplar-based (which emulate the allocation pattern of the observations with the highest sales). All three heuristics create biases in some situations. Overall, exemplar-based heuristics were used most frequently and induced the greatest biasing of the three (sometimes allocating the most to an advertising medium that was uncorrelated with sales). Difference-based heuristics were used less frequently but generated the most extreme allocations. Trend-based heuristics were used the least.","J. Wesley Hutchinson, Joseph W. Alba, Eric M.

Because the influence of potentially hundreds of friends needs to be evaluated for each user, inferring precisely who is influential—and, therefore, of managerial interest for advertising targeting and retention efforts—is difficult. The authors develop an approach to determine which users have significant effects on the activities of others using the longitudinal records of members' log-in activity. They propose a nonstandard form of Bayesian shrinkage implemented in a Poisson regression. Instead of shrinking across panelists, strength is pooled across variables within the model for each user. The approach identifies the specific users who most influence others' activity and does so considerably better than simpler alternatives.

Consumers previously exposed to broad assortments or categorizations base their decisions on fewer pieces of information, typically those made salient by the environment. In contrast, consumers previously exposed to narrow assortments or categorizations employ multiple pieces of information, both salient and nonsalient, without exerting any extra effort.

Vector autoregressive modeling of the metrics for more than 60 brands of four consumer goods shows that advertising awareness, brand consideration, and brand liking account for almost one-third of explained sales variance. Competitive and own mind-set metrics make a similar contribution. Wear-in times reveal that mind-set metrics can be used as advance warning signals that allow enough time for managerial action before market performance itself is affected.

Measuring Consumer Preferences for Complex Products: A Compositional Approach BasedonPaired Comparisons,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.4.685,02-Oct-18,01-Aug,2010,47,4,685,698,"Conjoint analysis has become a widely accepted tool for preference measurement in marketing research, though its applicability and performance strongly depend on the complexity of the product or service. Therefore, self-explicated approaches are still frequently used because of their simple design, which facilitates preference elicitation when large numbers of attributes need to be considered. However, the direct measurement of preferences, or rather utilities, has been criticized as being imprecise in many cases. Against this background, the authors present a compositional consumer preference measurement approach based on paired comparisons, otherwise known as PCPM. The trade-off character of paired comparisons ensures that the stated judgments are more intuitive than traditional self-explicated preference statements. In contrast to the latter, PCPM accounts for response errors and thus allows for the elicitation of more precise preferences. The authors benchmark PCPM against adaptive conjoint analysis and computer-assisted self-explication of multiattributed preferences to demonstrate its relative validity and predictive accuracy in two empirical studies using complex, high-involvement products. They find that PCPM yields better results than the benchmark approaches with respect to interview length, individual hit rates, and aggregate choice share predictions.","Sören W.

In this study, model specification is the only meaningful condition in differentiating the performance of the three approaches in parameter recovery. Specifically, when the model is correctly specified, covariance structure analysis tends to recover parameters better than the other two approaches. Conversely, when the model is misspecified, generalized structured component analysis tends to recover parameters better. Finally, partial least squares exhibits inferior performance in parameter recovery compared with the other approaches. In particular, this tendency is salient when the model involves cross-loadings. Thus, generalized structured component analysis may be a good alternative to partial least squares for structural equation modeling and is recommended over covariance structure analysis unless correct model specification is ensured.","Heungsun Hwang, Naresh K.

For example, consumers choose a greater quantity when flavor (or brand) decisions precede, rather than follow, size decisions. The authors find that the degree of attribute replaceability also moderates the effect of decision order on quantity chosen. Furthermore, marketers can influence the amount chosen by altering the organization of the shelf display.

In this research, the authors examine how consumers form value judgments of combinations of options representing health and indulgence goals, focusing on how people estimate the calorie content of such options. The authors show that when evaluating combinations of healthy (virtue) and indulgent (vice) options, consumers tend to systematically underestimate the combined calorie content, such that they end up averaging rather than adding the calories contained in the vice and the virtue. The authors attribute this bias to the qualitative nature of people's information processing, which stems from their tendency to categorize food items according to a good/bad dichotomy into virtues and vices. The authors document this averaging bias in a series of four empirical studies that investigate the underlying mechanism and identify boundary conditions.","Alexander Chernev, David Gal","categorization, vice, virtue, value, information processing, calorie, estimation",1,,,,
Store within a Store,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.4.748,01-Aug-10,01-Aug,2010,47,4,748,763,"In a store-within-a-store arrangement, retailers essentially rent out retail space to manufacturers and give them complete autonomy over retail decisions, such as pricing and in-store service. This intriguing retailing format appears in an increasing number of large department stores worldwide. The authors use a theoretical model to investigate the economic incentives a retailer faces when deciding on this arrangement. The retailer's trade-off is between channel efficiency and interbrand competition, moderated by returns to in-store service and increased store traffic. The retailer cannot credibly commit to the retail prices and service levels that the manufacturers effect in an integrated channel, so it decides instead to allow them to set up stores within its store. Thus, the stores-within-a-store phenomenon emerges when a powerful retailer, ironically, gives manufacturers autonomy in its retail space. An extension of the model to the case of competing retailers shows that the store-within-a-store arrangement can moderate interstore competition.","Kinshuk Jerath, Z.

Managing Sales Force Product Perceptions and Control Systemsinthe Success of New Product Introductions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.4.764,01-Aug-10,01-Aug,2010,47,4,764,776,"Given the importance of new products, firms may be prone to overmanage sales personnel by using behavior-based control systems that dictate the performance of particular activities related to the introduction. Such controls may be especially tempting given the findings that favorable salesperson product perceptions actually yield less effort on the new product, and behavior-based controls can offset this tendency. However, using longitudinal data from a sample of 226 salespeople, along with external ratings from customers and archival measures of effort and sales performance, the authors demonstrate that such a strategy is shortsighted. Behavior-based controls constrain a salesperson's ability to appropriately allocate effort across his or her customer base, negatively affecting customer product perceptions and, ultimately, new product sales. In contrast, outcome-based control systems enable salespeople to work smarter, and their corresponding effort on behalf of the new product has a more positive effect on customer product perceptions and new product sales.","Michael Ahearne, Adam Rapp, Douglas E.

Social Loss Aversion and Optimal Contest Design,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.4.777,01-Aug-10,01-Aug,2010,47,4,777,787,"When managers are designing a contest to motivate effort by salespeople, service employees, franchisees, or product development teams, a key question is, What should the optimal proportion of winners and losers be? Prevailing marketing theory predicts that the proportion of winners in a contest should always be lower than the proportion of losers. Not only has this theory not been empirically tested, but it is also based on the assumption that contestants care solely about the value of the prizes they receive. This self-interested assumption has been increasingly challenged in marketing and economics. This article uses a behavioral economics model to formalize the idea that if contestants also care about their contest outcomes relative to other contestants, changing the proportion of winners in a contest can alter the reference points contestants use to make these social comparisons. Consequently, a contest with a higher proportion of winners than losers can yield greater effort than one with fewer winners than losers if the degree of social loss aversion in the contestants is sufficiently strong. Two incentive-aligned experiments show that this prediction can be valid in situations with public announcements of contest outcomes.",Noah Lim,"contests, sales management, loss aversion, behavioral economics, experimental economics",,,,,
Raising the BAR: Bias Adjustment of Recognition Tests in Advertising,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.3.387,01-Jun-10,01-Jun,2010,47,3,387,400,"Advertising recognition tests use advertisements as visual retrieval cues; they require consumers to report which advertisements they remember having seen earlier and whether they noticed the advertised brand and read most of the text at the time. Using a heterogeneous randomly stopped sum model, the authors establish the relationship between consumers' actual attention to print advertisements, as measured through eye tracking, and subsequent ad recognition measures. They find that ad recognition measures are systematically biased because consumers infer prior attention from the ad layout and their familiarity with the brands in the advertisements. Such biases undermine the validity of recognition tests for advertising practice and theory development. The authors quantify the positive and negative diagnostic value of ad recognition for prior attention and demonstrate how these diagnostic values can be used to develop bias-adjusted recognition (BAR) scores that more accurately reflect prior attention. Finally, the authors show that differences in the scores from ad recognition tests based on in-home versus lab exposure attenuate when the bias-adjustment procedure is applied.","Anocha Aribarg, Rik Pieters, Michel Wedel","recognition test, advertising, bias correction, stopped sum model, Bayesian",,,,,
Consumer Options: Theory and an Empirical Application to a Sports Market,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.3.401,01-Jun-10,01-Jun,2010,47,3,401,414,"The authors introduce the concept of consumer options and empirically validate it in the context of event ticket pricing. They demonstrate that consumer options can protect consumers from the downside related to uncertain outcomes and enhance seller profits by enabling superior market segmentation and increasing consumer willingness to pay. The authors examine the newly proposed ticket pricing mechanism in sports markets, in which there is uncertainty about the teams that will play in a final event (e.g., the National Collegiate Athletic Association Final Four basketball tournament). Fans who want to attend the game after knowing which teams will play are often disappointed because tickets typically sell out in advance. The authors propose that a fan can buy an option on a ticket before this uncertainty is resolved. Later, he or she can decide whether to exercise the option. The authors present a simple analytical model of consumer options in this setting. Then, they empirically demonstrate that profits under option pricing can exceed those from (1) advance selling and (2) pricing after uncertainty is resolved.

Such multimarket contact has been shown to deter aggressive competition, leading to “mutual forbearance.” Empirical support for this phenomenon derives mainly from studies on the direct effects of multimarket contact on a firm's decision variables. The analysis in this article extends the existing literature by empirically considering both the direct effects of multimarket contact (i.e., how it affects a firm's decision variables) and its strategic effects (i.e., how it affects a firm's reactions to its competitors' decision variables). The authors study the pricing and new product introduction decisions of firms in the personal computer industry. Consistent with prior research, the authors find that firms mutually forbear in price and new product introductions. More important, the authors find strong strategic effects that are asymmetric; namely, firms respond to competitive attacks by introducing new products but do not use price as a retaliatory weapon. Thus, firms isolate any competitive retaliation to only a single marketing variable. The results offer a deeper understanding of the influence of multimarket contact on firm behavior.","Wooseong Kang, Barry L.

Dynamics of Pricing in the Video Game Console Market: Skimming or Penetration?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.3.428,01-Jun-10,01-Jun,2010,47,3,428,443,"Nintendo lost its dominant position in the video game industry during the console war between its Nintendo 64 and Sony's PlayStation. However, Nintendo could have made several different strategic decisions to change the outcome. This article develops a structural model and investigates these alternative strategies through policy simulations. In particular, the author provides a framework to study firms' optimal pricing strategies under network effects, consumer heterogeneity, and oligopolistic competition. Consumer heterogeneity provides an incentive for a durable goods manufacturer to price skim, while network effects lead to an opposite motive for penetration pricing. The proposed framework incorporates these two competing motives under oligopolistic competition. The author estimates a demand system that allows for indirect network effects and consumer heterogeneity and then numerically solves for the Markov perfect equilibrium in firms' dynamic pricing game. Policy simulations indicate that Nintendo could have won the console war either with 10% more games or with a “head start” of one million units in installed base at the time of the PlayStation introduction.",Hongju Liu,"price skimming, penetration pricing, policy simulation, indirect network effect, dynamic programming",3,,,,

A critical challenge in estimating marketing-mix responsiveness from historical data is that the observed decisions were affected by private information possessed by managers about the heterogeneous effects of marketing-mix variables on sales. The authors refer to this as the “slope endogeneity” problem. Such endogeneity differs from the “intercept endogeneity” problem, which has been widely acknowledged in the literature. To correct for the slope endogeneity bias, the authors develop a conceptually simple control function approach that is amenable to multiple endogenous variables and marketing-mix carryover effects. The method is applied to forecasting advertising responsiveness in the U.S. DVD market. The results suggest that advertising responsiveness varies substantially across DVD titles and that estimated marketing-mix elasticities would be biased if the slope endogeneity problem were ignored.

However, knowledge of such intrahousehold behavioral interaction enables marketers to target their communications more effectively. In this article, the authors propose a modeling framework to capture the intrahousehold behavioral interaction based on family members' actual consumption behavior over time. The authors develop a model to capture multiple agents' (more than two individuals') simultaneous choice decisions over more than two choice alternatives. This is extremely difficult with other previously developed modeling approaches. The authors apply the proposed model to a context of family members' television viewing and simultaneously model whether the television is on, which type of program is playing, and which family members are watching. The proposed model makes it possible to estimate the individual's intrinsic preference and the extrinsic preference from a joint consumption with other members. In turn, these estimates enable the authors to test several alternative group decision-making heuristics that may operate in those joint consumption occasions and to conduct managerially useful counterfactual simulations.","Sha Yang, Yi Zhao, Tülin Erdem,...","autologistic choice model, joint consumption, behavioral interaction, family-member decision making, hierarchical Bayesian analysis",,,,,

When Choosing Makes a Good Thing Better: Temporal Variations in the Valuation of Hedonic Consumption,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.3.497,01-Jun-10,01-Jun,2010,47,3,497,507,"This research investigates how the valuation of delayed consumption of hedonic products, such as concerts and chocolate, varies with the passage of time between choice and consumption. The authors find that when consumers make their own choices, they exhibit increases in evaluations of delayed consumption, but only if the interval between choice and consumption is relatively short. The effect attenuates over longer periods, resulting in an inverted U-shaped relationship between evaluations and time. In contrast, when somebody else chooses the same option for the consumer, evaluations decrease with the passage of time. These effects depend on the extent of intrinsic motivation toward the object of consumption and occur only for consummatory consumption that is of inherent interest. Moreover, anticipatory increases in evaluations before consumption have ironic negative effects on postconsumption evaluations.

The underlying process for both outcomes is a recency effect, such that there is better recall for the most recently sampled experiential product. The recency effect observed for experiential products reverses to a primacy effect when sampling nonexperiential products (e.g., scissors). The authors also demonstrate that the placement of an undesirable experiential product in conjunction with two desirable experiential products can exaggerate preference for the later-sampled desirable product (when the undesirable product is sampled first) or result in preference for the earlier-sampled desirable product (when the undesirable product is sampled between the two desirable products). However, the preference for the earlier-sampled desirable product holds only if there is no time delay between the sampling of the products or between the sampling and the choice evaluations.","Dipayan Biswas, Dhruv Grewal, Anne Roggeveen","experiential products, sampling, order effects, choice behavior, mixed choice set",,,,,

Initial forays into this area suggest that the depletion of self-regulatory resources is irrelevant when advertisement arguments are strong or consumers are highly motivated to process. In contrast to these conclusions, the authors contend that depletion has important but previously hidden effects in such contexts. That is, although attitudes are equivalent in valence and extremity, consumers are more certain of their attitudes when they form them under conditions of depletion than nondepletion. The authors propose that this effect occurs because feeling depleted induces the perception of having engaged in thorough information processing. As a consequence of greater attitude certainty, depleted consumers' attitudes exert greater influence on their purchase behavior. Three experiments, using different products and ad exposure times, confirm these hypotheses. Experiment 3 demonstrates the potential to vary consumers' naive beliefs about the relationship between depletion and thoroughness of processing, and this variation moderates the effect of depletion on attitude certainty. The authors discuss the theoretical contributions and implications for marketing.","Echo Wen Wan, Derek D. Rucker, Zakary L.

Three questions are addressed: (1) Does allowing sellers to connect to each other create value (i.e., increase sales)?

Assortment Size, Expectations, and Satisfaction,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.2.312,02-Oct-18,01-Apr,2010,47,2,312,322,"Recent research challenges the idea that greater choice is always desirable, showing that larger assortments can increase choice deferral and switching. The current research demonstrates that even when consumers make a purchase, the same item may generate lower satisfaction when chosen from a larger rather than a smaller assortment. The authors explain this effect in terms of an expectation-disconfirmation mechanism. When assortments are small, consumers have low expectations about their ability to match their preferences. As assortment sizes increase, so do consumers’ expectations of the degree of preference match they can achieve. Subsequently, consumers may experience greater negative expectation disconfirmation or less positive expectation disconfirmation when a chosen item comes from a larger rather than a smaller set. Either less positive or more negative disconfirmation leads to lower choice satisfaction. The results from three studies support this expectation-based process and establish this mechanism in addition to alternative explanations, such as choice overload.","Kristin Diehl, Cait Poynor","assortment size, expectation disconfirmation, satisfaction, choice overload, information overload",9,,
The Slippery Slope: The Impact of Feature Alignability on Search and Satisfaction,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.2.323,01-Apr-10,01-Apr,2010,47,2,323,334,"This research challenges the notion that increased search effort results in greater satisfaction with the choice by examining the impact of alignability on search quantity and search outcomes. Options that vary along comparable dimensions are alignable, whereas options that vary along unique dimensions are nonalignable. The results of three studies demonstrate greater search among nonalignable than among alignable options. Satisfaction initially increases but then declines with further search among nonalignable options. Although choice difficulty influences search and satisfaction, the primary mechanism driving the inverted U-shaped relationship of satisfaction with search among nonalignable options is feature learning. This research demonstrates a paradox: People continue searching more options precisely when their further search is detrimental to their satisfaction, falling down the slippery slope of search.","Jill G.

Brand Extension Strategy Planning: Empirical Estimation of Brand–Category Personality Fit and Atypicality,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.2.335,01-Apr-10,01-Apr,2010,47,2,335,347,"The majority of brand extensions reportedly fail, suggesting the need for methodologies that allow for better strategic prediction of categories into which a brand should extend or license. Prior literature suggests that brand extensions are likely to be more successful if a brand extends into another category into which its existing brand associations and imagery “fit” better and if the extending brand is “atypical” (if it possesses associations and imagery that are broad and abstract rather than tied too closely to the brand's original product category). The authors develop a methodology in this study to estimate brand and category personality structures, using a Bayesian factor model that separates the two by means of brand-level and category-level random effects. This methodology leads to measures of a brand's fit and atypicality.

Branding also has important implications for persuasion and for the “function-matching” advantage: Although utilitarian appeals are most persuasive for “utilitarian” products (and symbolic appeals are most persuasive for “symbolic” products) at the category level, this article shows that this pattern does not emerge at the brand level, in part because attitude functions change with branding.","Robyn A.

They focus on a validity problem that has not been investigated previously, namely, the impact of cognitive inertia on IAT effects. Cognitive inertia refers to the difficulty in switching from one categorization rule to another, which causes IAT effects to depend on the order of administration of the two IAT blocks. In Study 1, the authors observe an IAT effect when the compatible block precedes the incompatible block but not when it follows the incompatible block. In Studies 2 and 3, the IAT effect changes its sign when the order of the blocks reverses. Cognitive inertia distorts individual IAT scores and diminishes the correlations between IAT scores and predictor variables when the block order is counterbalanced between subjects. Study 4 shows that counterbalancing the block order repeatedly within subjects can eliminate cognitive inertia effects on the individual level. The authors conclude that researchers should either interpret IAT scores at the aggregate level or, if individual IAT scores are of interest, counterbalance the block order repeatedly within subjects.","Claude Messner, Joachim Vosgerau","implicit association test, cognitive inertia, validity, implicit attitudes, order effects",3,,,,

It leads to inconsistency with standard estimation methods that maintain independence between the model's error and the included variables. The authors describe a control function approach for handling endogeneity in choice models. Observed variables and economic theory are used to derive controls for the dependence between the endogenous variable and the demand error. The theory points to the relationships that contain information on the unobserved demand factor, such as the pricing equation and the advertising equation. The authors’ approach is an alternative to Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes's (1995) product-market controls for unobserved quality. The authors apply both methods to examine households’ choices among television options, including basic and premium cable packages, in which unobserved attributes, such as quality of programming, are expected to be correlated with price. Without correcting for endogeneity, aggregate demand is estimated to be upward-sloping, suggesting that omitted attributes are positively correlated with demand. Both the control function method and the product-market controls method produce downward-sloping demand estimates that are similar.","Amil Petrin, Kenneth Train","customer choice, endogeneity, advertising, price effects, econometric models",7,,,,

In addition, it is possible to incorporate covariates in to various parts of the model. The proposed method is especially useful to study social issues in marketing.

However, this impact is moderated by increases in consumers’ debt service ratio, a key budget constraint that affects consumers’ ability to spend. Using an asymmetric growth model, more than 23% of the variation in the one-quarter-ahead spending growth is explained, which represents a notable improvement over prior specifications.","Claes Fornell, Roland T.

This study investigates the effect of multiple types of ties with a customer on a supplier's performance with the customer. The findings from panel data on supplier–customer relationships suggest that an increase in the number of different types of ties with a customer results in an increase in supplier sales to the customer and a decrease in sales volatility to that customer. The effect of a change in relationship multiplexity (i.e., number of different types of ties) on the change in sales becomes weaker and its effect on the change in sales volatility becomes stronger as the competitive intensity in the customer's industry increases. The results also indicate that the effect of a change in the number of different types of ties on the change in sales volatility becomes stronger when the intangibles intensity in a customer's industry increases. The results are robust to alternative measures, alternative estimators, heteroskedasticity, and endogeneity, among other methodological concerns.

The authors find that regardless of whether the manufacturer offers a trade promotion, allowing the retailer to forward buy and hold inventory for the future can, under certain conditions, be beneficial for both parties. Disallowing forward buying by the retailer may lead the manufacturer to lower merchandising requirements and change the depth of the promotion. In competitive environments, there are situations in which retailers engage in forward buying because of competitive pressures in a prisoner's-dilemma situation. Finally, when the authors consider the case of uncertain demand, they find further evidence of strategic forward buying. In particular, the authors find cases in which the retailer orders a quantity that is higher than what it expects to sell in even the most optimistic demand scenario.","Preyas S.

Patient-or Physician-Oriented Marketing: What Drives Primary Demand for Prescription Drugs?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.1.103,01-Feb-10,01-Feb,2010,47,1,103,121,"The authors analyze primary demand effects of marketing efforts directed at the physician (detailing and professional journal advertising) versus marketing efforts directed at the patient (direct-to-consumer advertising).

Primary demand effects are rather small, in contrast with the estimated sales effects for individual brands. By using a new brand-level method to estimate primary demand effects with aggregate data, the authors show that the small effects are due to intense competitive interactions during the observation period but not necessarily to low primary demand responsiveness. In contrast with previous studies, the authors also find that detailing is more effective in driving primary demand than direct-to-consumer advertising. A category sales model cannot provide such insights. In addition, a category sales model likely produces biased predictions about period-by-period changes in primary demand.

Typical antismoking programs contain three indirectly competing messages: Smokers are attractive and prevalent but also worthy of disapproval. Experiment 1 tests several program versions with these three messages and reveals that the disapproval message dominates and elicits negative smoker thoughts and beliefs, despite the otherwise potent smoker attractiveness message. Experiment 2 indicates corresponding effects for intent but shows that adding a directly competitive smoker approval message nullifies this effect. Furthermore, Experiment 2 tests an educational epilogue designed to reinforce the disapproval message, but this message instead induces boomerang effects among smokers. That is, among smokers, an educational placement is counterattitudinal, so when the epilogue discloses the placement and evokes persuasion knowledge, smokers generate more positive smoker beliefs and intentions.

An application of the model to many pharmaceutical products, estimated through (exact initial) Kalman filtering, indicates that both persistent and transient effects occur predominantly immediately after a brand's introduction.

For products for which heaviness is considered a positive attribute, packages with the product image placed at heavy locations are preferred, whereas for products for which heaviness is considered a negative attribute, packages using light locations are preferred. Furthermore, in the former category (e.g., snacks), a salient health goal, as opposed to a neutral goal, weakens the preference for packages using heavy locations, though this moderating effect of goal is weaker for healthful snacks than for regular snacks. Store shelf context is a boundary condition, such that the location effects on perceived product heaviness and package evaluation appear in a contrasting context but disappear in an assimilating context.

Specifically, they show that size estimations follow an inelastic power function of the actual size of the product, especially when all three spatial dimensions change simultaneously. As a result, consumers are more likely to supersize their orders when products change in one dimension and are more likely to downsize their orders when products change in three dimensions. When changing dosage, consumers pour more product into and out of conical containers (e.g., martini cocktail glasses, in which volume changes in three dimensions) than cylindrical containers (e.g., highball glasses, in which volume changes in one dimension).

In addition, the by-attribute customization procedure leads to a lower level of experienced difficulty greater satisfaction, and higher willingness to purchase the customized option than the by-alternative method. Finally the decrease in experienced difficulty in the by-attribute customization method is not solely due to the reduction in information consideration but also due to less explicit trade-offs among competing characteristics.

Building on theories of emotional contagion and sympathy the authors propose that (1) people “catch” the emotions displayed on a victim's face and (2) they are particularly sympathetic and likely to donate when they see sad expressions versus happy or neutral expressions. Consistent with emotional contagion, participants felt sadder when viewing a sad-faced victim, and their own sadness mediated the effect of emotion expression on sympathy. Contagion effects are automatic and noninferential, but they are diminished by deliberative thought. The authors discuss the implications of using subtle emotional expressions on charitable and other marketing appeals.","Deborah A. Small, Nicole M.

Benefits Leader Reversion: How a Once-Preferred Product Recaptures its Standing,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.6.788_JMR6G,01-Dec-09,01-Dec,2009,46,6,788,797,"In general, consumers establish a preference for one product early in a decision process. When this preference does not include consideration of product prices, the currently preferred product is called the “benefits leader.” This article proposes that consumers who switch to a cheaper product after learning prices retain a trace of preference for the benefits leader. Retention of the benefits leader is evidenced by the distortion of new information to favor the benefits leader and by greater-than-normative reversion to it. The authors also find that reversion does not occur when the initially leading product (that consumers switch from) is based on a cost savings. This suggests that though consumers retain cognitive elements associated with benefits leaders, they do not retain similar elements associated with leaders based on cost savings.","Kurt A.

The Political Participation Puzzle and Marketing,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.6.798_JMR6H,01-Dec-09,01-Dec,2009,46,6,798,815,"This study shows that one of the most intriguing findings on political participation—that the participation rate is higher in close elections—is due to the omission of variables, namely, the marketing activities. This relationship between closeness and participation is intriguing because (1) it implies that people participate in elections because their vote might be decisive, but (2) such an incentive to vote is unreasonable. This study presents a theoretical model that suggests that closeness does not affect the turnout rate directly but rather through the marketing activities of the parties. In other words, in equilibrium, close elections attract higher marketing spending, which in turn increases turnout. The author uses data on the 1996–2004 presidential elections in the United States to examine the model and its implications. Using structural (and nonstructural) estimation, the author finds that the data support the model and its implications. Furthermore, the effect of marketing on turnout is dramatic. For example, if the marketing activity were canceled in the 2004 elections, the number of voters would have decreased by 15 million.",Ron Shachar,"political marketing, marketing communications, structural estimation of an equilibrium model, advertising effectiveness, structural clustering",,,,,
Statistical Benefits of Choices from Subsets,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.6.816_JMR6I,01-Dec-09,01-Dec,2009,46,6,816,831,"Marketers often analyze multinomial choice from a set of branded products to learn about demand. Given a set of brands to study, the authors analyze three reasons why choices from strict subsets of the brands can contain more statistical information about demand than choices from all the brands in the study: First, making choices from smaller subsets is easier, so it is possible to use more choice tasks when the choice data come from a choice-based conjoint survey. Second, choices from subsets of brands better identify and more accurately estimate the covariance structure of unobserved utility shocks associated with brands. Third, subsets automatically balance the brand shares when some of the brands are less popular than others. The authors demonstrate these three benefits of subsets using a mixture of analytical results and numerical simulations and provide implications for the design of choice-based conjoint analyses. They find that the optimal subset size depends on the model, the number of brands in the study and the designer's resource constraint. In addition to showing that subsets can be beneficial, this article provides a simulation methodology that helps designers pick the best subset size for their setting.","Robert Zeithammer, Peter Lenk","choice models, conjoint, experiment design, choice set, probit",,,,,

First, the authors discuss selecting informative priors for variances and introduce a conjugate prior for covariance matrices. The proposed prior is more flexible than the inverse Wishart without increasing computations. Second, the authors investigate the impact of priors for the covariance of parameter heterogeneity when the predictor variables are qualitative. Estimates of the omitted effects are spurious with the standard prior. The authors propose an effects prior that treats all effects symmetrically. Third, the authors consider willingness to pay. These ratio estimators magnify uncertainty in the price coefficients and can give unreasonable values for price-insensitive consumers. The authors show that estimation of willingness to pay can be greatly improved by restricting the parameters without distorting them. In all three cases, the standard, noninformative priors perform well for nonsparse data. However, for sparse data, the proposed prior distributions better match the structures of the marketing research problems and improve inferences.","Peter Lenk, Bryan Orme","choice-based conjoint, variance estimation, willingness to pay priors, effects coding, hierarchical Bayes",,,,,
A Conjoint Approach for Consumer- and Firm-Level Brand Valuation,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.6.846_JMR6K,01-Dec-09,01-Dec,2009,46,6,846,862,"This article develops and tests a reduced-form, conjoint methodology for measuring brand equity. The proposed approach (1) provides objective dollar-metric values for brand equity without the need to collect perceptual or brand association data, (2) captures the effects of awareness and availability in the marketplace as sources of brand equity, (3) accounts for competitive reaction, (4) allows the mix of branded and unbranded firms to affect industry size, and (5) uses consideration set theory to project market share estimates from the conjoint experiment to the marketplace. Managers can use the approach to develop customized strategies for targeting customers, monitoring brand “health,” allocating resources, and determining the values of brands in a merger or acquisition. The empirical results suggest that the proposed metric for measuring consumer-level brand equity has convergent validity; in addition, the magnitudes and strengths of brand equity vary considerably across consumers and brands. At the firm level, the results show that previous methods are likely to overstate brand equity, especially for products with low market shares.

Buyer Monitoring: A Means to Insure Personalized Service,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.5.573,02-Oct-18,01-Oct,2009,46,5,573,583,"Marketing scholars have proposed that service employees play a primary role in delivering service quality. However, the question of how to motivate service employees to enhance service production has received little research attention. The authors address this gap by advocating a control mechanism first discussed in the economics literature—buyer monitoring. The authors focus on a pervasive form of buyer monitoring, voluntary tipping, and examine the effectiveness of this control mechanism as a means for improving service in two contexts: leisure cruises and restaurant dining. Despite a substantial interdisciplinary literature reporting a weak relationship between customers' perceptions of service and their tipping behavior, the results show that a policy of voluntary tipping has positive effects on the motivation and behavior of service workers and on customers' perceptions of the service those workers provide. These findings call attention to buyer monitoring as both a topic for academic research and a practical mechanism for motivating service employees. The findings also call into question trends away from tipping in service contexts, such as the cruise industry, and suggest that many service businesses for which tipping is not viable can benefit from alternative forms of buyer monitoring.","Robert J.

Using a multisite regression discontinuity quasi-experimental design developed over 16 months, they control for unobserved heterogeneity among guests and treatments across hotels and develop Bayesian posterior estimates of the varying program effect for each hotel. The results contribute to theory and practice. First, they provide new insights into how service guarantee programs operate in the field. Specifically, the guarantee was more effective at hotels with a better prior service history and an easier-to-serve guest population, which is consistent with signaling arguments but does not comport with the incentive argument that guarantees actually improve service quality. Second, the results offer managers better decision rules. Specifically, the authors devise program continuation rules that are sensitive to both observed and unobserved differences across sites. In addition, they devise policies to reward hotels that exceed site-specific expectations. By controlling for observed and unobserved differences across sites, the authors show that these policies potentially reward even hotels with negative net program effects, which is useful in reducing the organizational stigma of failure.

When Should Original Equipment Manufacturers Use Branded Component Contracts with Suppliers?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.5.597,01-Oct-09,01-Oct,2009,46,5,597,611,"Branded components are becoming increasingly popular in industrial markets; yet extant research provides limited understanding of the use of such arrangements in the real world. The authors use the governance lens of transaction cost economics to propose that leveraging the vendor's brand reputation and safeguarding the vendor's customization investments are key motivators for choosing branded component contracts. Data on 191 contracts from three engineering-intensive industry sectors provide support to the authors' hypotheses. The authors find that firms are more likely to choose branded component contracts when the supplier's brand name adds significant differentiation (leveraging) and when the component supplier has made significant component customization investments (safeguarding). This safeguarding motivation is relevant even to suppliers with modest brand reputation. The authors also investigate the normative consequences of these contracting decisions and find significant adverse outcomes from choosing the “wrong” contract form. Furthermore, they find that these outcomes are asymmetric in nature. In particular, choosing a “white box” contract when the theory argues for a branded component contract leads to more adverse outcomes than choosing a branded component contract when the theory predicts a “white box” contract.

The authors apply this model to decisions by managers at 2233 Internet service providers of whether to offer their customers access through 56K modems in 1997. The model is validated by showing that firms with a higher estimated probability of strategic thinking were more likely to have survived through April 2007. The estimation results show considerable heterogeneity in the degree to which firms behave strategically and suggest that strategic ability affects marketing outcomes; specifically, a simulated increase in strategic ability means that fewer firms offer the technology to their customers.","Avi Goldfarb, Botao Yang","behavioral game theory, empirical industrial organization, technology diffusion, Internet service providers, cognitive hierarchy",,,,,

They show that advertising is considerably more sensitive to business-cycle fluctuations than the economy as a whole. Advertising behaves less cyclically in countries high in long-term orientation and power distance, but it is more cyclical in countries high in uncertainty avoidance. Furthermore, advertising is more sensitive to the business cycle in countries characterized by significant stock market pressure and few foreign-owned multinational corporations. The authors provide initial evidence on the long-term social and managerial losses incurred when companies tie ad spending too tightly to business cycles. Countries in which advertising behaves more cyclically exhibit slower growth of the advertising industry. Moreover, private-label growth is higher in countries characterized by more cyclical advertising spending, implying significant losses for brand manufacturers. Finally, an examination of 26 global companies shows that stock price performance is lower for companies that exhibit stronger procyclical advertising spending patterns.","Barbara Deleersnyder, Marnik G.

The authors find that foreign takeoffs, but not foreign introductions, accelerate a focal country's time to takeoff. The larger the country, the higher its economic wealth, and the more it exports, the more clout it has in the global spillover process. In contrast, the poorer the country, the more tourists it receives, and the higher its population density, the more susceptible it is to global spillover effects. Cross-country spillover effects are stronger the closer the countries are to one another, both geographically and economically, but not necessarily in terms of culture.

Sales Effects of Attention to Feature Advertisements: A Bayesian Mediation Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.5.669,01-Oct-09,01-Oct,2009,46,5,669,681,"There is much evidence that the presence of a feature advertisement can increase the sales and market share of the featured product. However, little is known about how feature ad characteristics (e.g., size, color, and location of the advertisement) affect the sales outcomes and how the effects take place. Prior research has predicted that feature advertisements lead to behavioral outcomes through their effect on consumers' attention. Building on this idea, the authors propose a Bayesian statistical model to study how feature ad characteristics affect sales of the featured products and the mediating role of attention in these relationships. They use data from eye-tracking tests of feature advertisements, aggregated and matched with sales data at the level of the feature advertisement. Their approach accounts for endogeneity in the key variables involved and overcomes limitations of standard mediation analyses. They show that the gaze duration on a feature advertisement affects sales of the featured product beyond the mere presence of the advertisement and that a standard mediation analysis that does not accommodate endogeneity produces biased estimates of the effects of feature ad characteristics on sales. Their proposed methodology is widely applicable to mediation analyses. The findings imply that attention data collected in lab tests can help marketers compare the relative sales outcomes of different feature ad designs and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of feature adverting decisions.","Jie Zhang, Michel Wedel, Rik Pieters","endogeneity, instrument variable, promotion, eye tracking, visual marketing",,,,,

The empirical work controls for factors that are known to influence the bond market, such as firm profitability and risk, as well as potential unobservable factors. The findings indicate that firms with lower customer satisfaction exhibit lower credit ratings and higher debt costs—financial consequences of customer satisfaction not previously observed.

Equally important, consumers exhibit inertia in their brand choices, a form of psychological switching cost. This makes the results applicable to the broad range of products that are distinctly identified (i.e., branded) rather than just to products for which there is a product adoption cost or explicit switching fee. In the simulations, prices are as much as 18% lower with than without switching costs.

These regressions use the results of the initial model to correct for the endogeneity of observed market structures. The results from both exercises illustrate several important asymmetries across the firms. Kmart and Wal-Mart prefer similar markets, but Wal-Mart's competitive position is dominant enough to prevent Kmart's operation in otherwise attractive markets.

In the credit card business, all customers are not equally risky. When a customer misses one payment on a credit card bill, a signal is sent to the credit card company. It is important for the card issuer to interpret the signal and to identify whether the customer is a low-risk one, who will eventually pay back the debt and contribute to the card issuer's profits by paying interest on the overdue balance, or a high-risk one, who will not pay back the debt. The issuer can then customize its policies to deal with these different consumer types.

In the fast-growing high-tech and entertainment industries, products from complementary categories are often incompatible with one another. This research shows that when choosing a pair of such complementary products, a consumer is likely to use a two-stage decision strategy: screening by one category first to narrow down the number of pairs for further evaluation in the second stage. In the presence of incompatibility, screening by one category rather than by the other may lead to different choice outcomes. The authors develop a behavioral theory–driven choice model that accounts for both preference heterogeneity and structural heterogeneity of decision strategies to examine the extent to which consumers engage in category-based screening. Analysis of data from a 2 × 2 conjoint choice experiment reveals that consumers tend to screen a category that has higher intracategory differentiation and is congruent with their decision goals.

The method allows for two sources of randomness in observed market shares: unobserved product characteristics and sampling error. Because of the latter, the method is suitable when sample sizes underlying the shares are finite. In contrast, Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes's commonly used approach assumes that observed shares have no sampling error. The method can be viewed as a generalization of Villas-Boas and Winer's approach and is closely related to Petrin and Train's “control function” approach. The authors show that the proposed method provides unbiased and efficient estimates of demand parameters. They also obtain endogeneity test statistics as a by-product, including the direction of endogeneity bias. The model can be extended to incorporate Markov regime-switching dynamics in parameters and is open to other extensions based on maximum likelihood. The benefits of the proposed approach are achieved by assuming normality of the unobserved demand attributes, an assumption that imposes constraints on the types of pricing behaviors that are accommodated. However, the authors find in simulations that demand estimates are fairly robust to violations of these assumptions.","Sungho Park, Sachin Gupta","random coefficients, logit model, endogeneity, heterogeneity, simulated maximum likelihood, aggregate data, brand choice, scanner data",,,,,

More important, this lack of sensitivity can explain hyperbolic discounting. The results replicate standard hyperbolic discounting effects with respect to objective time but show a relatively constant rate of discounting with respect to subjective time perceptions.

Channel Negotiations with Information Asymmetries: Contingent Influences of Communication and Trustworthiness Reputations,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.4.557,01-Aug-09,01-Aug,2009,46,4,557,572,"This article reports three experiments that examine how communication types (informational, relational, and coercive messages) and mutual trustworthiness reputations influence sequential bargaining between an uncertain manufacturer and an informed distributor in a marketing channel. In Experiment 1, bargainers use informational and relational messages to establish a positive social tenor in the interaction. Compared with when bargainers communicate only through offers and counteroffers, explicit communication produces quicker and more efficient agreements. The effects are stronger when manufacturer uncertainty is relatively high. In Experiment 2, mutual reputations of high (versus low) trustworthiness also produce quicker and more efficient agreements. In both studies, the larger extracted surplus increases manufacturer profits without affecting distributor profits. However, contrary to economic intuition, the gains from communication accrue asymmetrically to the uninformed manufacturer. Experiment 3 shows the effects of communication type are contingent on the prevailing level (high or low) of trustworthiness reputations in the dyad. Compared with no communication, relational messages elicit the most positive (negative) outcomes when trustworthiness reputations are high (low). Informational messages have a smaller but positive impact on bargaining outcomes in both trustworthiness conditions and appear to build trust.","Joydeep Srivastava, Dipankar Chakravarti","marketing negotiations, distribution channels, communication, trust, asymmetric information",,,,,

These demands create a need to translate marketing resource allocations and their performance consequences into financial and firm value effects. The objective of this article is to integrate the existing knowledge on the impact of marketing on firm value. The authors first frame the important research questions on marketing and firm value and review the important investor response metrics and relevant analytical models as they relate to marketing. Next, they summarize the empirical findings to date on how marketing creates shareholder value, including the impact of brand equity, customer equity, customer satisfaction, research and development and product quality, and specific marketing-mix actions. Then, the authors review emerging findings on biases in investor response to marketing actions. They conclude by formulating an agenda for future research challenges in this emerging area.","Shuba Srinivasan, Dominique M.

The authors examine the related but previously unaddressed issue of whether the unexpected exit of an option from a choice set returns the choice shares of the original options to the status quo. In a series of experiments, they observe that when an option turns out to be unselectable following a choice problem in which it was selectable, the choice shares of the remaining options are predictably different from those of a choice problem in which the option was unselectable from the start. They also observe that this attraction effect due to the disappearance of a decoy is likely a consequence of changes in the importance of decision criteria.

This research examines the implications of the interplay between these two types of decision processes for context effects in choice by exploring the consequences of the depletion of executive resources in a prior, unrelated task. Building on a substantial body of psychological literature that points to a single underlying resource used for self-regulation and executive control, this article demonstrates that resource depletion has a systematic influence on choice in context. Specifically, resource depletion enhances the role of intuitive reasoning by impairing deliberate, careful processing. In five experiments, the authors find that resource depletion increases the share of reference-dependent choices, decreases the compromise effect, and magnifies the attraction effect. The results shed light on the mechanisms underlying context effects in choice and suggest that the scope of the depleted resource is not constrained to self-regulation activities but rather extends to choice in general.","Anastasiya Pocheptsova, On Amir, Ravi Dhar,...","behavioral decision theory, context-dependent preferences, resource depletion, constructed preferences, choice constriction",22,,,,
Designing Sales Contests: Does the Prize Structure Matter?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.3.356,01-Jun-09,01-Jun,2009,46,3,356,371,"Sales contests are short-term incentives that managers use to raise sales effort. The extant marketing theory predicts that the optimal prize structure should have two characteristics: (1) The number of prizewinners should be greater than one, and (2) prize values should be unique and rank ordered. However, this theory has not been empirically examined. This article presents two empirical studies that examine whether the prize structure of a sales contest affects sales performance. In each study, the authors investigate the incremental effects of introducing multiple prizewinners and unique rank-ordered prizes into a sales contest. The first study consists of two laboratory experiments in which participants make decisions that closely reflect the decision trade-offs in the theoretical model of sales contests. The second study consists of two field economic experiments in which trained salespeople sell fundraising sponsorships to companies. The results across the experiments are remarkably consistent: The number of prizewinners in a sales contest should indeed be greater than one. However, introducing rank-ordered prizes into contests with multiple prizewinners does not boost sales effort and revenues.","Noah Lim, Michael J. Ahearne, Sung H.

The authors assess this phenomenon in a series of three experiments, in which people are exposed to sequential and fair gambles in a two-stage process (planned and actual bets). The results show that in the planning phase, people behave conservatively, betting on average less after an anticipated loss and the same amount after an anticipated gain. However, after experiencing an actual loss in the first gamble, people bet in a subsequent gamble significantly more than they had initially planned, whereas on average, there were no observable differences from the plan after an actual gain. The reason for such asymmetry is due in part to people's tendency to underestimate, at the planning phase of the gamble, the impact of negative emotions in betting decisions during the actual phase of the gamble.","Eduardo B.

Three experiments examine how fear-inducing versus romantic contexts influence the effectiveness of two widely used heuristics—social proof (e.g., “most popular”) and scarcity (e.g., “limited edition”). The results support the predictions from an evolutionary model, showing that fear can lead scarcity appeals to be counterpersuasive and that romantic desire can lead social proof appeals to be counterpersuasive.

A key issue in making these decisions is the role of assortment size in determining consumers’ choice of a retailer. The authors address this issue by investigating how consumer choice among retailers offering various-sized assortments is influenced by the attractiveness of the options constituting these assortments. The data show that consumer preference for retailers offering larger assortments tends to decrease as the attractiveness of the options in their assortments increases and can even lead to a reversal of preferences in favor of retailers offering smaller assortments. This research further presents evidence that the relationship between assortment size and option attractiveness is concave, such that the marginal impact of assortment size on choice decreases as the attractiveness of the options increases.

However, when an advertisement is intended to induce consumers to benefit someone else (e.g., to donate money for relief of disaster victims), stimulating them to imagine themselves in the situation confronting the beneficiary can sometimes conflict with the image they form of themselves as a potential helper. This conflict in imagined perspective can decrease the advertisement's effectiveness. Five studies confirm this hypothesis. When participants took the perspective of the beneficiary at the time they read an appeal for help, characteristics of the appeal that increased the ease with which they could imagine the situation from this perspective (e.g., a picture of the victim) had a positive effect on both their urge to help and the amount of money they donated. However, when they had an a priori disposition to take the perspective of a potential donor at the time they read the appeal, these same characteristics decreased the appeal's effectiveness.","Iris W.

The authors develop scenarios about the relative importance of these effects and the efficiency of markets. Empirical analysis of historical data on 19 categories shows that though both quality and network effects affect market share flows, in general markets are efficient. In particular, market share leadership changes often, switches in share leadership closely follow switches in quality leadership, and the best-quality brands, not the ones that are first to enter, dominate the market.

However, the literature has rarely modeled how services penetrate a market and has not evaluated the effect of attrition on growth. The authors combine diffusion modeling with a customer relationship approach to investigate the influence of attrition on growth in service markets. In particular, the authors model the effects of disadoption and churn on evolution of a category and on growth of individual firms in a competitive environment. The authors show how neglecting disadoption can bias parameter estimation and, especially, market potential. They also derive an expression for the customer equity of a growing service firm and apply it to valuation of firms operating in competitive industries.

Extending recent research on store choice, they add assortments as a predictor, specify a general structure for heterogeneity, and estimate store choice and category needs models simultaneously. Using household-level market basket data, the authors find that, in general, assortments are more important than retail prices in store choice decisions. They find that the number of brands offered in retail assortments has a positive effect on store choice for most households, while the number of stockkeeping units per brand, sizes per brand, and proportion of stockkeeping units that are unique to the store (a proxy for presence of private labels) have a negative effect on store choice for most households. They also find more heterogeneity in response to assortment than to either convenience or price. Therefore, optimal assortments depend on the particular preferences of a retailer's shoppers. Finally, the authors find a correlation in household-level responses to assortment and travel distance (r = .43), which suggests that the less important an assortment is to a consumer's store choices, the more the consumer values convenience, and vice versa.","Richard A.

The analysis constitutes a scenario in which capacity-constrained firms set prices conditional on their location, demand, and costs. This enables firms to develop maps of latent demand patterns across the market in which they compete. The analysis further suggests locations for additional outlets and the resultant equilibrium effect on profits and prices. Using Bayesian spatial statistics, the authors apply their model to seven years of data on apartment location and prices in Roanoke, Va. They find that spatial covariation in demand is material in outlet choice; the 95% spatial decay in demand extends 3.6 miles in a region that measures slightly more than 9.5 miles. They also find that capacity constraints can cost complexes upward of $100 per apartment. As they predict, price elasticities and costs are biased downward when spatial covariance in demand is ignored. Costs are biased upward when capacity constraints are ignored. Using the analysis to suggest locations for entry, the authors find that properly accounting for spatial effects and capacity constraints leads to an entry recommendation that improves profitability by 66% over a model that ignores these effects.","Jason A.

They find that the underlying mechanism for this effect is imagination's impact on the perceived value of new benefits rather than on the learning costs. Furthermore, they show that the advantage of an imaginative focus is not simply due to the increased focus on product benefits, because imagination still leads to higher product evaluation than memory-focused visualization, even if participants in both conditions are asked to think about product benefits exclusively. Finally, an explicit focus on learning costs while using an imaginative approach draws attention away from product benefits and attenuates the advantage of imagination on product evaluation.","Min Zhao, Steve Hoeffler, Darren W.

The results from a set of experiments show that ease of computation can affect judgments of the magnitude of price differences, discount magnitudes, and brand choices. Participants seem to believe that it is easier to judge the size of a larger difference than that of a smaller difference. In the absence of appropriate corrective steps, this naive belief can lead to systematic biases in judgments. For example, when presented with two pairs of numbers, participants incorrectly judged the magnitude of the difference to be smaller for pairs with difficult computations (e.g., 4.97 – 3.96, an arithmetic difference of 1.01) than for pairs with easy computations (e.g., 5.00 – 4.00, an arithmetic difference of 1.00). The effect does not manifest when judgments do not entail mental computations or when participants are made aware that the ease or difficulty is caused by computational complexity. Furthermore, this effect is mitigated when participants’ prior experience is manipulated in a learning phase of the experiment. The results have implications for buyers and sellers and for understanding the role of metacognitive experiences in numerical judgments.","Manoj Thomas, Vicki G.

The Importance of a General Measure of Brand Engagement on Market Behavior: Development and Validation of a Scale,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.1.92,01-Feb-09,01-Feb,2009,46,1,92,104,"Brand engagement in self-concept (BESC) is a generalized view of brands in relation to the self, with consumers varying in their tendency to include important brands as part of their self-concepts. The authors develop an eight-item scale to measure BESC and demonstrate that it captures a consumer's general engagement with brands. This scale successfully predicts consumers’ differential attention to, memory of, and preference for their favorite brands. Brand engagement in self-concept is also related to differential brand loyalty, with high-BESC consumers being less price and time sensitive regarding their favorite brands than low-BESC consumers. The authors discuss the usefulness of this construct for marketing research.","David Sprott, Sandor Czellar, Eric Spangenberg","self-concept, self–brand connection, brand attitudes, brand preferences, brand equity",,,,,

Dynamic and Competitive Effects of Direct Mailings: A Charitable Giving Application,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.1.120,01-Feb-09,01-Feb,2009,46,1,120,133,"The authors propose a dynamic direct mailing response model with competitive effects. Purchase and promotion history are incorporated to map the dynamic competitive interactions among the firms sending the mailings. The authors investigate the impact of direct mailings on the revenues of each firm and its competitors over time. The model accounts for endogeneity of the mailing decision and for unobserved heterogeneity across households. The model is considered in a charitable giving setting, in which households often receive many direct mailings of different charities within a short period and competition is strong. The authors construct a unique database by merging the databases of three large charity organizations in the Netherlands. This results in household-level data on the direct mailings households received from and their donations to each of the three charities. The results show that a charity's own mailings are short-term substitutes; that is, an extra mailing cannibalizes the revenues of subsequent mailings. Furthermore, competitive charitable direct mailings tend to be short-term complements; that is, the direct mailings increase the total pie that is divided among the charities. In the long run, these effects die out. The results are also interpreted from a behavioral perspective.","Merel Van Diepen, Bas Donkers, Philip Hans Franses","dynamics, competition, direct mailings, charitable donating",,,,,

The Effect of Partitions on Controlling Consumption,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.6.665,01-Dec-08,01-Dec,2008,45,6,665,675,"The authors demonstrate that partitioning an aggregate quantity of a resource (e.g., food, money) into smaller units reduces the consumed quantity or the rate of consumption of that resource. Partitions draw attention to the consumption decision by introducing a small transaction cost; that is, they provide more decision-making opportunities so that prudent consumers can control consumption. Thus, people are better able to constrain consumption when resources associated with a desirable activity (which they are trying to control) are partitioned rather than when they are aggregated. This effect of partitioning is demonstrated for the consumption of chocolates (Study 1) and gambles (Study 2). In Study 3, process measures reveal that partitioning increases recall accuracy and decision times. Importantly, the effect of partitioning diminishes when consumers are not trying to regulate consumption (Studies 1 and 3). Finally, Study 4 explores how habituation may decrease the amount of attention that partitions draw to consumption. In this context, partitions control consumption to a greater extent when the nature of partitions changes frequently.","Amar Cheema, Dilip Soman","self-control, partitions, consumption, attention, guilt",13,,,,
Remedying Hyperopia: The Effects of Self-Control Regret on Consumer Behavior,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.6.676,01-Dec-08,01-Dec,2008,45,6,676,689,"The self-control literature is premised on the notion of myopia (shortsightedness or present-biased preferences) and assumes that choosing vices generates regret. An alternative perspective suggests that consumers often suffer from a reverse self-control problem—namely, excessive farsightedness and overcontrol, or “hyperopia.” This research examines whether consumers can foresee the detrimental long-term consequences of hyperopia. Five studies demonstrate that anticipating long-term regret relaxes self-control and motivates consumers to counteract their righteousness. Consumers are more likely to select indulgences and luxuries when they judge the longer-term regrets of others, anticipate their own regret in the distant future, and reflect on their regret regarding an actual decision made in the more distant past. The article concludes with two field experiments that examine the effect of anticipatory regret on real consumer purchases at a shopping mall and during Thanksgiving. These experiments demonstrate that anticipating long-term regret leads consumers to buy pleasurable products rather than practical necessities and to spend more on shopping. The implications for marketers and consumers are discussed.","Anat Keinan, Ran Kivetz","hyperopia, self-control, regret, consumer behavior",22,,,,
Positive Consumer Contagion: Responses to Attractive Others in a Retail Context,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.6.690,16-Oct-18,01-Dec,2008,45,6,690,701,"This research examines the impact of attractiveness on consumers during a consumption experience. Specifically, it examines the effects of an attractive social influence in the context of touching and contamination of store products by investigating how consumers respond when they see attractive others touching the same products they want to purchase. In doing so, it provides the first experimental evidence of a positive contagion effect in either the marketing or the psychology literature. Across three field experiments using an actual retail shopping environment, the authors find that product evaluations are higher when consumers perceive a product as having been physically touched by a highly attractive other. Moreover, they identify sex as a critical moderating variable in the realization of this positive contagion effect; the contact source and observing consumer must be of the opposite sex for positive contagion to occur. Finally, in contrast to previous work, the authors demonstrate that these effects are driven by a physical model of contagion.","Jennifer J. Argo, Darren W. Dahl, Andrea C.

Endogeneity and Individual Consumer Choice,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.6.702,01-Dec-08,01-Dec,2008,45,6,702,714,"In many markets, there is likely to be correlation both across periods in terms of the choices of one consumer and across consumers in terms of their choices in each period. The former is caused by consumer heterogeneity, and the latter may be the result of demand common shocks across consumers. Furthermore, if firms partially observe these common shocks, their market decisions may end up being endogenous and correlated with the common shocks. Because researchers cannot typically fully observe consumer heterogeneity and the common shocks, the estimation method must account for the endogeneity of firms’ decisions. In this article, the authors present a test for endogeneity under unobserved consumer heterogeneity and common shocks, which is based on a quasi-likelihood estimation method, to estimate the model parameters consistently when endogenous firm behavior, unobserved heterogeneity, and common shocks are present. The test examines the differences in general method of moments coefficient estimates of a model with and without instrumenting for the explanatory variables. The authors show theoretically that in their estimation method, unobserved heterogeneity does not affect the consistency of the parameter estimates, but if it is not accounted for, endogeneity may bias the results.

The methodology is based on augmenting the aggregate data with unobserved (simulated) sequences of choices and coupon usage consistent with the aggregate data. The authors analyze various marketing scenarios that differ in terms of their assumptions about consumer choices, coupon availability, and coupon redemption. They illustrate the proposed methods using both simulated data and a real data set for which an extensive set of posterior predictive checks helps validate the aggregate-level estimation.

In the final two studies, the authors show that variety and uniqueness arrays activate distinct constructs; specifically, they find no effect of exposure to uniqueness arrays on variety seeking (Study 4a) and no effect of exposure to variety arrays on uniqueness seeking (Study 4b). Taken together, these studies build on the existing literature about nonconscious effects on consumer behavior and choice behavior in particular by showing that consumers’ real choices are affected by subtle exposure to novel stimuli that do not have any previous associations.","Michal Maimaran, S.

Winners and Losers in a Major Price War,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.5.499,01-Oct-08,01-Oct,2008,45,5,499,518,"Although retail price wars have received much business press and some research attention, it is unclear how they affect consumer purchase behavior. This article studies an unprecedented price war in Dutch grocery retailing that started in fall 2003, initiated by the market leader to halt its sliding market share. The authors investigate the short- and long-term effects of the price war on store visits, on spending, and on the sensitivity of these decisions to weekly prices and price image. They use a unique data set with consumer hand-scan and perceptual data for a national panel of 1821 households, covering two years before and two years after the price war started. Although the price war initially entailed more shopping around and increased spending, spending per visit ultimately dropped because consumers redistributed their purchases across stores. The price war made consumers more sensitive to weekly prices and price image, which helped both the chain that showed an improvement in price image (the price war initiator) and the chains that already had a favorable price image (hard discounters). The price war initiator managed to halt the slide in its market share, and its stock price improved. The losers were the rival mid-level and high-end chains. Unlike the initiator, their price image did not improve, and they suffered from increased price image sensitivity.

Their measure of performance impact is the change in shareholder value around the announcement date, which has recently been recognized as an important metric to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing actions. The authors find strong support for the conceptual model, which distinguishes between the seriousness of the threat to the incumbents and their capacity to withstand the threat. The authors validate their findings using three alternative measures of company performance: percentage growth in the incumbent retailer's sales, earnings before interest and taxes, and return on assets between 1998 (the year before the Asda takeover) and 2002 (three years after the takeover).

The fear is that in the absence of salary caps or other regulatory mechanisms, smaller-market teams will be unable to remain competitive. This research uses a structural dynamic programming model to analyze ownership's payroll investment decisions. This model estimates the relationship between optimal payrolls and local-market populations and the influence of long-term customer equity dynamics on payroll investments. In addition, the author analyzes the impact of a recent policy intervention that implemented revenue transfers from high-local-revenue markets to low-local-revenue markets. The statistical results indicate that market population has a significant impact on the value of a team's payroll investments. For example, optimal payrolls double as the population increases from 2.5 million to 7.5 million. Furthermore, rather than improving competitive balance, the adoption of revenue sharing has decreased the incentives for small-market teams to remain competitive. The author uses the estimation results to evaluate alternative approaches to managing competitive balance. Specifically, the results suggest that basing revenue-sharing payments on local-market population and (higher) attendance rates reduces payroll dispersion.",Michael Lewis,"customer equity, sports marketing, dynamic programming, alliance management",,,,,

The results suggest that incumbency, many bidders, and a willingness to make specific investments lead to less aggressive bidding, whereas the total number of bids from competing suppliers increases aggressiveness. In turn, aggressive bidding behavior reduces suppliers' disposition toward developing a relationship with the buyer and sours incumbent satisfaction with the relationship. Finally, auctions that are longer in duration can improve the relationship but may risk bidding competition. Collectively, the results suggest that pricing and relationships are intertwined and traded off against each other in complex ways and that the auction does not operate in isolation of key organizational variables.","Sandy D.

During the process, the participant states his or her willingness to pay for each potential upgrade he or she is interested in, and a BDM (Becker–DeGroot–Marschak) procedure ensures that it is in the best interest of the participant to state truthfully his or her willingness to pay.

To Innovate or Imitate?

The authors establish that when the incumbent is more aggressive in research and development (R&D), this negatively affects the entrant's marginal return on R&D. Thus, if greater profits produce a strong (weak) desire for the incumbent to increase its R&D level, the entrant will respond by sharply decreasing (increasing) its R&D level. As a result, the incumbent's likelihood of retaining the lead position will exhibit an inverse U-shaped pattern as a function of monopoly and duopoly profits. The authors then examine the impact of uncertainty about the rewards from new products and allow firms to conduct market research to resolve the uncertainty. They characterize the conditions for the entrant's innovation versus imitation decision to reveal information about future rewards to the incumbent. When duopoly profits are uncertain and can be either high (upside potential) or low (downside potential), the entry strategy will be revealing if the upside potential is attractive enough relative to monopoly profits. In contrast, when innovation has uncertain commercial potential (i.e., either valued or not valued by consumers), the entry strategy will be revealing if duopoly profits are unattractive relative to monopoly profits. In these cases, the entrant's innovation–imitation decision is driven by market research; this allows the incumbent to forgo market research and infer the true state of demand from the type of entry strategy it observes.","Elie Ofek, Ozge Turut","new product development, entry strategy, market research, innovation management",,,,,

Massive questionnaires are pervasive in marketing practice. As an alternative to the heuristic methods that are currently used to split questionnaires, this study develops a methodology to design the split questionnaire in a way that minimizes information loss.

Their design criterion is based on a general mixed data model that accommodates continuous, rank-ordered, and discrete measurement scales. The optimal construction of the split questionnaire design is easy and fast. The authors use Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures to impute missing values that result from the design. They generate split questionnaire designs by selecting either entire blocks of questions (between-block design) or sets of questions in each block (within-block design). They compare the efficiency of split questionnaires generated with the proposed method with multiple matrix sampling designs, incomplete block designs, and a heuristic procedure, using synthetic and empirical Web survey data.

The authors propose that this phenomenon, which they term “reverse alliesthesia,” occurs as a result of the activation of a general motivational state by cues that are high in incentive value. They test this proposition by showing that the effect is (1) attenuated if the activated motivational state is satiated before the subsequent consumption task and (2) stronger for people who are high rather than low on the behavioral activation system scale.

The authors propose that in such contexts, the information provider's current and past behaviors, relative to those of other information providers, influence who the information seeker believes provides a valuable response and how valuable he or she judges the provider's information to be. The authors track information queries, information provider responses, and objective valuation of these responses by information seekers in a Web forum, in which responses to information queries come from multiple information providers with whom the information seeker has not met face-to-face and has had no prior interaction. Among other results, the authors show that a provider's response speed, the extent to which the provider's previous responses within the focal domain have been positively evaluated by others, and the breadth of the provider's previous responses across different domains of knowledge affect objective judgments of information value. Importantly, these effects are moderated by the information seeker's goal orientation. The information provider's experience in responding to questions in different domains of knowledge increases judgments of information value for information seekers with a decision-making orientation, whereas the information provider's reputation for providing valuable contributions within the focal domain increases judgments of information value for information seekers with a learning orientation.","Allen M.

Attentional Contrast during Sequential Judgments: A Source of the Number-of-Levels Effect,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.4.437,01-Aug-08,01-Aug,2008,45,4,437,449,"Conjoint analysis is used to measure the importance of attribute-level trade-offs. A methodological anomaly is the number-of-levels effect; that is, as the number of intervening attribute levels increases, the derived importance weight of an attribute increases. The authors use three studies to show that attentional processes contribute to the number-of-levels effect. When there is an inequality in the number of levels across attributes, a given profile may include levels of one attribute that are relatively more novel than levels of the accompanying attributes. A process of attentional contrast directs attention toward the relatively novel attribute levels within each profile. Increased attention toward these attribute levels results in a larger derived importance weight for the attributes defined on those levels.","Els De Wilde, Alan D.J.

When 2 + 2 is Not the Same as 1 + 3: Variations in Price Sensitivity across Components of Partitioned Prices,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.4.450,01-Aug-08,01-Aug,2008,45,4,450,461,"Firms often use a pricing strategy in which the total price of a product and/or service is partitioned into two or more mandatory components. Whereas previous research has compared partitioned with nonpartitioned pricing, this article examines how partitioning the total price differently across the components affects consumer preferences. In four studies, the authors show that consumers' reactions to price partitioning are moderated by the perceived consumption benefit of the components. Specifically, consumers are more sensitive to the price of components that provide low consumption benefits than to the price of components that provide relatively high consumption benefits. Consequently, when evaluating different partitions of the same total price, consumers prefer partitions in which the price of the low-benefit component is lower and the price of the high-benefit component is higher.","Rebecca W.

Anytime versus Only: Mind-Sets Moderate the Effect of Expansive versus Restrictive Frames on Promotion Evaluation,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.4.462,01-Aug-08,01-Aug,2008,45,4,462,472,"Three studies demonstrate that the framing of redemption windows as expansive or restrictive, with the actual length of the window held constant, influences consumers' evaluations of sales promotions.

However, consumers in a deliberative mind-set prefer the restrictive (only) frame to the expansive (anytime) frame. Study 1 reveals that whereas the former consumers attend more to their ability to redeem the offer, the latter are influenced more by the precision of the offer.

Distribution Intensity and New Car Choice,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.4.473,01-Aug-08,01-Aug,2008,45,4,473,486,"The authors develop a new method to assess how changes in the intensity of mature distribution networks—specifically, those in the U.S. automotive industry—might affect consumer choice. They capture distribution intensity by car make (e.g., Honda, Toyota) at the disaggregate level using the exact geographic locations of individual buyers and new car dealers. They develop three buyer-centric measures for the intensity level of each competing make from this information: (1) dealer accessibility (the buyer's distance to the nearest outlet for each make), (2) dealer concentration (the extent to which multiple dealers for each make are located near a given buyer), and (3) dealer spread (the dispersion of the multiple dealers for each make relative to the buyer's location). The authors propose a logit choice model, estimated with Bayesian methods, to study the association of these measures with new car choices. They apply the model to buyer records in the midsize premium sedan category, drawn from an anonymous sample provided by the Power Information Network. All three buyer-centric measures of intensity were significantly related to new car choice. Buyers were more likely to select cars whose dealer networks had shorter distances to the closest outlet (accessibility), more dealers within a given radius from the buyer (concentration), and locations that skewed toward the buyer (spread). Based on the modeling results, the market share elasticity of distribution intensity averages approximately .6 across the new car models included in the study. The approach should help firms evaluate the potential effects of expanding or contracting distribution networks for mature products.","Randolph E. Bucklin, S. Siddarth, Jorge M.

Decomposing Promotional Effects with a Dynamic Structural Model of Flexible Consumption,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.4.487,01-Aug-08,01-Aug,2008,45,4,487,498,"In this article, the authors offer a methodology to decompose the effects of price promotions into brand switching, stockpiling, and change in consumption by explicitly allowing for consumer heterogeneity in brand preferences and consumption needs. They develop a dynamic structural model of a household that decides when, what, and how much to buy, as well as how much to consume, to maximize its expected utility over an infinite horizon. By making certain simplifying assumptions, the authors reduce the dimensionality of the problem. They estimate the proposed model using household purchase data in the canned tuna and paper towels categories. The results from the model offer insights into the decomposition of promotional effects into its components. This could help managers make inferences about which brand's sales are more responsive to stockpiling or increase in consumption expansion and how temporary price cuts affect future sales. Contrary to previous literature, the authors find that brand switching is not the dominant force for the increase in sales. They show that brand-loyal consumers respond to a price promotion mainly by stockpiling for future consumption, whereas brand switchers do not stockpile at all. The authors also find that heavy users stockpile more, whereas light users mainly increase consumption when there is a price promotion.","Tat Chan, Chakravarthi Narasimhan, Qin Zhang","decomposition of promotional effects, dynamic structural model, flexible consumption, consumer heterogeneity",3,,,,

By examining a broad range of brands in each category, the authors find that positive sales evolution from promotional efforts is fairly common, especially for small brands. Moreover, the authors find that both permanent and cumulative sales effects from marketing promotions are greater for brands with higher equity and more product introductions, whereas brands with low equity gain greater benefits from product introductions.

In Studies 2 and 2a, using theories of mental simulation, the authors show that in the distant-future adoption scenario, communication strategies that promote outcome simulations are more effective in reducing performance uncertainty, bolstering positive feelings, and enhancing behavioral intentions. In contrast, in the near-future adoption scenario, communication strategies that promote process simulations are better at reducing switching cost and affective uncertainties, assuaging anxiety, and increasing behavioral intentions. The authors also find positive effects of these communication strategies on actual adoption rates and postconsumption satisfaction (Study 2) and on delayed behavioral intentions (Study 2a). In addition, these communication strategies are more efficacious in increasing behavioral intentions when uncertainty levels are higher (Study 3).

However, these beneficial effects are likely to emerge only under conditions in which the interdependent consumer is motivated to elaborate extensively on the extension information.

Three laboratory studies then examine the mechanisms that underlie the effect. The magnitude of the disposition effect is unaffected by experimental manipulations of the subjective likelihood of future gains or losses. However, it is eliminated by inducing participants to define gains and losses in similar subjective units. Furthermore, the effect depends on whether participants make selling decisions on their own stocks or serve as an agent for someone else. Thus, the disposition effect is largely a result of differences in the subjective value that participants attach to possible gains and losses rather than of differences in their beliefs that these outcomes will occur.

The authors argue that this is not necessarily the case. Instead, they show that when people learn preferences in context (e.g., through repeated choices made from a trinary choice set that includes an asymmetrically dominated decoy), they learn a context-specific choice heuristic (e.g., they always choose the asymmetrically dominating option), which leads to less consistent preferences across contexts. In contrast, repeated choices from sets containing only two options impel people to learn their subjective attribute weights, yielding preferences that are consistent across contexts. The difference between choice construction and preference construction is of importance to marketing managers because repeat purchase is typically interpreted as a signal of customer preference. The authors show that this “preference” might just be a learned solution to the choice problem and that as soon as the competitive context changes (even in a normatively meaningless way), so will consumers' preferences.","On Amir, Jonathan Levav","behavioral decision theory, preference learning, context-dependent preferences, constructed preferences, choice construction",,,,,
Can Trade-Ins Hurt You?

Drawing on research on mental accounting, the authors reason that when consumers engage in a transaction involving a trade-in (i.e., when they act as both buyer and seller simultaneously), they place more importance on getting a good value for the used product than on getting a good price for the new product. As a result, such consumers exhibit a higher willingness-to-pay price for the new product than consumers who just buy the new product alone. The results from a series of laboratory experiments provide systematic support for this hypothesis.

In doing so, they must frequently choose among items that are grouped in assortments, such as those offered by a particular store or brand. This article examines how the number of to-be-purchased items influences consumer choice among assortments. It is argued that when consumers are uncertain about their preferences, they are more likely to prefer an assortment for which the number of available options matches the desired purchase quantity. This prediction is based on the notion that a match between the size of an assortment and the number of to-be-purchased items enables consumers to simplify the selection process by eliminating the need to trade off the benefits and costs of individual choice alternatives—a strategy referred to as the “quantity-matching heuristic.” The theoretical predictions are supported by data from five empirical studies that offer converging evidence for the role of purchase-quantity goals in assortment choice and identify moderating factors and boundary conditions.",Alexander Chernev,"assortment, purchase quantity, consumer choice, heuristics, retailing",,,,,

The authors propose a method using conjoint analysis for multipart pricing. The method reflects the two-way dependence between prices and consumption and incorporates consumers' uncertainty about their use of a service. The proposed method estimates both choice probabilities and usage levels for each consumer as functions of the product features and the different price components. The authors then use these estimates to evaluate the expected revenues and profits of alternative plans and pricing schemes.

Although competitive advertising interference has been shown to reduce advertising recall and recognition and brand evaluation measures, no studies have examined its impact on brand sales. In this research, the authors use a market response model of sales for two grocery categories for a large grocery chain in the Chicago area to study the extent to which competitive advertising interference influences sales. The model enables the authors to capture the “pure” own-brand advertising elasticities that would arise if there were no competitive interference. The results show that competitive interference effects on sales are strong. When one or more competing brands advertise in the same week as the focal brand, the advertising elasticity diminishes for the focal brand. The decrease depends on the number of competing brands advertising in a particular week and their total advertising volume. The authors find that having one more competitor advertise is often more harmful to a focal brand's advertising effectiveness than if the current number of advertising brands increase their total advertising volume.","Peter J.

A household can respond to price promotions by effectively cherry-picking through (1) spatial price search across stores and (2) temporal price search across time. However, extant research has analyzed these two dimensions of price search only separately and therefore underestimates both the consumer response to price promotions and the impact of promotions on retail profit. In this article, the authors introduce an integrated analysis of spatial and temporal price search. They seek answers to three questions: First, what are the predictors of household decisions to perform either spatial or temporal price search? Second, how effective are the temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal price search strategies in obtaining lower prices? and Third, what is the impact of alternative price search strategies on retailer profit? The authors use a unique data collection approach that combines household surveys with observed purchase data to address these questions. Their key results are as follows: Geography (the spatial configuration of store and household locations) and opportunity costs are useful predictors of a household's price search pattern. Households that claim to search spatiotemporally avail approximately three-quarters of the available savings on average. Households that search only temporally save about the same as those that search only spatially. The negative effect of cherry-picking on retailer profits is not as high as is typically believed.","Dinesh K. Gauri, K.

In turn, this increased accessibility influences product evaluation and choice, which are found to vary directly with the frequency of exposure to conceptually related cues.

Analysis shows that perceived brand relevance and energy provide incremental information to accounting measures in explaining stock returns. However, esteem and knowledge do not; that is, their effects are reflected in current-term accounting measures and in brand relevance and energy. The financial markets do not view brand differentiation as having incremental information content, but they should.

Value Creation following Merger and Acquisition Announcements: The Role of Strategic Emphasis Alignment,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.1.033,01-Feb-08,01-Feb,2008,45,1,33,47,"The purpose of this article is to investigate how strategic emphases of merging firms (marketing or research and development) create value in a merger context. The authors suggest that strategic emphasis alignment—the extent to which the resource configurations of acquirer and target firms are similar to or distinct from one another—is a key construct that facilitates value creation. Using data on abnormal stock returns, the authors also suggest that when merging firms have low strategic emphasis alignment, value is enhanced when the merger motive is diversification. In contrast, when merging firms have high strategic emphasis alignment, value is enhanced when the merger motive is consolidation.","Vanitha Swaminathan, Feisal Murshed, John Hulland","mergers and acquisitions, resource-based view, marketing resources, value creation, event study",,,,,
The Impact of Marketing-Induced versus Word-of-Mouth Customer Acquisition on Customer Equity Growth,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.1.048,01-Feb-08,01-Feb,2008,45,1,48,59,"Companies can acquire customers through costly but fast-acting marketing investments or through slower but cheaper word-of-mouth processes. Their long-term success depends critically on the contribution of each acquired customer to overall customer equity. The authors propose and test an empirical model that captures these long-term effects. An application to a Web hosting company reveals that marketing-induced customers add more short-term value, but word-of-mouth customers add nearly twice as much long-term value to the firm.

The model identifies the key phenomena required to analyze customer migration, shows how these phenomena can be modeled, and develops an approach for estimating the model. The methodology is unique in its ability to accommodate heterogeneous customer responses to a large number of distinct marketing communications in a dynamic context. The results indicate that (1) Web purchasing is associated with lower subsequent purchase volumes than when buying from other outlets; (2) marketing efforts are associated with channel usage and purchase incidence, offsetting negative Web experience effects; and (3) negative interactions occur between like communications (catalog × catalog or e-mail × e-mail) and between different types of communications (catalog × e-mail). The authors find that over the four-year period of their data, a Web-oriented “migration” segment emerged, and this group had higher sales volume. Their post hoc analysis suggests that marketing efforts and exogenous customer-level trends played key roles in forming these segments. The authors rule out alternative explanations, such as that the Web attracted customers who were already heavy users or that the Web developed these customers into heavier users. They conclude with a discussion of implications for both academics and practitioners.","Asim Ansari, Carl F. Mela, Scott A.

Recommendation Systems with Purchase Data,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.1.077,01-Feb-08,01-Feb,2008,45,1,77,93,"Many firms use decision tools called “automatic recommendation systems” that attempt to analyze a customer's purchase history and identify products the customer may buy if the firm were to bring these products to the customer's attention. Much of the research in the literature today attempts to recommend products that have a high probability of purchase (conditional on the customer's history). However, the author posits that the recommendation decision should be based not on purchase probabilities but rather on the sensitivity of purchase probabilities to the recommendation action. This article attempts to model carefully the role of firms' recommendation actions in modifying customers' buying behaviors relative to what the customers would do without such a recommendation intervention. The author proposes a simple consumer behavior model that accommodates a transparent role for a firm's recommendation actions. The model is expressed in econometric terms so that it can be estimated with available data.

This calls for the extension of current stockkeeping unit choice models to consider attribute-level feedback effects. The authors develop such a model using an internal market structure analysis approach. This provides the benefit of attribute-level competitive maps and estimates of attribute-level reinforcing behavior versus derived varied behavior.

In this article, the authors present a new item response theory–based model for measuring ERS. This model contributes to the ERS literature in two ways. First, the method improves on existing procedures by allowing different items to be differentially useful for measuring ERS and by accommodating the possibility that an item's usefulness differs across groups (e.g., countries). Second, the model integrates an advanced item response theory measurement model with a structural hierarchical model for studying antecedents of ERS. The authors simultaneously estimate a person's ERS score and individual- and group-level (country) drivers of ERS. Through simulations, they show that the new method improves on traditional procedures. They further apply the model to a large data set consisting of 12,506 consumers from 26 countries on four continents. The findings show that the model extensions are necessary to model the data adequately.

Assessing Three Sources of Misresponse to Reversed Likert Items,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.1.116,01-Feb-08,01-Feb,2008,45,1,116,131,"Data collected through multi-item Likert scales that contain reversed items often exhibit problems, such as unexpected factor structures and diminished scale reliabilities. These problems arise when respondents select responses on the same side of the scale neutral point for both reversed and nonreversed items, a phenomenon the authors call “misresponse.” Across four experiments and an exploratory study using published data, the authors find that misresponse to reversed Likert items averaged approximately 20%, twice the level identified as problematic in previous simulation studies. Counter to prevailing thought, the patterns of misresponse and response latency across manipulated items could not be attributed to respondent inattention or acquiescence. Instead, the pattern supports an item verification difficulty explanation, which holds that task complexity, and thus misresponse and response latency, increases with the number of cognitive operations required for a respondent to compare a scale item with his or her belief. The observed results are well explained by the constituent comparison model.","Scott D. Swain, Danny Weathers, Ronald W.

A Model of Consumer Learning for Service Quality and Usage,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.4.529,01-Nov-07,01-Nov,2007,44,4,529,544,"In many services (e.g., the wireless service industry), consumers choose a service plan according to their expected consumption. In such situations, consumers experience two forms of uncertainty. First, they may be uncertain about the quality of their service provider and can learn about it after repeated use of the service. Second, they may be uncertain about their own usage of minutes and learn about it after observing their actual consumption. The authors propose a model to capture this dual learning process while accounting for the nonlinearity of the pricing scheme used in wireless services. The results show that both quality learning and quantity learning are important. The authors conduct several policy experiments to capture the effects of consumer learning, pricing, and service quality on customer lifetime value (CLV). They find that consumer learning can result in a win–win situation for both consumers and firm; consumers leave less minutes on the table, and the firm experiences an increase in overall CLV. For example, the authors find that there is a 35% increase (approximately $75) in overall CLV with consumer learning than without. The key driver of this result is the change in the retention rate with and without learning.","Raghuram Iyengar, Asim Ansari, Sunil Gupta",,,,,,
Brand-Level Effects of Stockkeeping Unit Reductions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.4.545,01-Nov-07,01-Nov,2007,44,4,545,559,"When retailers make product assortment changes by eliminating certain stockkeeping units (SKUs), how does this affect sales of individual brands? This is the main question the authors address in this article. Using data from an online retailer that implemented a permanent systemwide SKU reduction (SR) program, the authors investigate how the program affected various components of purchase behavior for individual brands. They find substantial variations in the SR effects across brands, categories, and consumers. They explore possible drivers for these differences and find that higher-market-share, higher-priced, and more frequently promoted brands tend to gain share and that reduction in the number of sizes, reduction in the number of SKUs, and change in SKU share in the category are important in affecting change in a brand's purchase share after the SR. They also find that SRs lead to an increase in category purchase incidence and quantity for highly state-dependent consumers and frequent buyers but a decrease in category purchase and quantity for mildly state-dependent consumers and infrequent buyers. In addition, SRs tend to cause more changes in brand choice probabilities among consumers of lower state dependence and higher price and promotion sensitivity. These findings are of importance both to retailers wanting to make product assortment changes and to manufacturers affected by them.","Jie Zhang, Aradhna Krishna",,,,,,
Optimal Marketing Strategies for a Customer Data Intermediary,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.4.560,01-Nov-07,01-Nov,2007,44,4,560,578,"Advances in data collection and storage technologies have given rise to the customer data intermediary (CDI), a firm that collects customer data to offer customer-specific marketing services to marketers. With widespread adoption of customer relationship management (CRM) and one-to-one (1:1) marketing, the demand for such services continues to grow. Extant empirical research using customer data for CRM and 1:1 marketing tends to have an engineering emphasis and focuses on developing analysis techniques to implement CRM and 1:1 marketing optimally (i.e., the technology for the CDI). In contrast, this article focuses on marketing strategy issues that the intermediary faces, given the availability of the technology to implement such services. Specifically, the authors develop an empirical framework to evaluate the optimal customer (exclusive/nonexclusive), product (quality or accuracy of the 1:1 customization), and pricing strategy for a CDI. They illustrate the framework for one type of CDI—a 1:1 coupon service firm that caters to grocery manufacturers—using household purchase history data from the ketchup market. The authors find that selling on a nonexclusive basis using the maximum available purchase history data is the most profitable strategy for the CDI in the particular market. They also evaluate the potential impact of retailers entering the 1:1 coupon service business. Because 1:1 marketing can increase the retailer's profits from goods sold, it is optimal for the retailer to undercut the prices of a pure-play CDI that offers 1:1 coupon services.","Joseph Pancras, K.

Second, the authors compare performance of the proposed customer selection framework (1) with the current customer selection procedure in the collaborating firm and (2) with different customer-level cost allocation rules that are necessary for computing CLV. The study finds that given a budget constraint, customers selected by means of a Bayesian decision theory–based framework (i.e., using the maximized expected CLV of a customer and the corresponding optimal marketing costs as an estimate of future costs) provide the highest profits. The study provides guidelines for implementation and illustrates how the proposed customer selection framework can aid managers in enhancing marketing productivity and estimating return on marketing actions.","Rajkumar Venkatesan, V.

A Discrete–Continuous Model for Multicategory Purchase Behavior of Households,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.4.595,01-Nov-07,01-Nov,2007,44,4,595,612,"This article provides an integrated utility-maximizing framework for households’ multicategory purchase incidence, brand choice, and purchase quantity decisions. On a store visit, households maximize utility across several categories subject to an overall budget constraint. Then, they choose to purchase a subset of categories, in which they select a specific brand and an associated quantity level. Under their assumptions for the stochastic terms in the specification, the authors obtain closed-form expressions for the household demands, the marginal and joint purchase incidence, and the brand choice probabilities along with conditional purchase quantities. The authors show that the modeling framework accounts for both coincidence and complementarity/ substitutability across categories. In addition, it accounts for unobserved heterogeneity in the estimation. Thus, the three key features of multicategory models proposed in the literature are all reflected in the framework. The authors provide an empirical application of the methodology using four categories from the Stanford market basket data—laundry detergent, fabric softener, toilette tissue, and paper towel. The results indicate that, in general, cross-category effects, as measured by the cross-category price elasticities between brands in the categories, are small, and they arise mostly through consumers’ joint purchase incidence decisions rather than at the purchase quantity decision conditional on brand choice. This finding indicates that the effects of coincidence are larger than the effects of complementarity in these data.","Inseong Song, Pradeep K. Chintagunta",3,,,,,

Compared with existing methods, the advantage of the proposed method is that it allows for the analysis of microlevel consumer dynamic behavior, such as the impact of purchase history on current brand choice, when only aggregate-level data are available. The essence of this approach is to simulate latent choice data that are consistent with the observed aggregate data. When the augmented choice data are made available in each iteration of the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, the dynamics of consumer buying behavior can be explicitly modeled. The authors first demonstrate the validity of the method with a series of simulations and then apply the method to an actual store-level data set of consumer purchases of refrigerated orange juice. The authors find a significant amount of dynamics in consumer buying behavior. The proposed method is useful for managers to understand better the consumer purchase dynamics and brand price competition when they have access to aggregate data only.","Yuxin Chen, Sha Yang",,,,,,

Using the proposed location model, which is based on the assumption of social welfare maximization by a policy planner, the authors find that local potential gasoline demand depends positively on the local demographic characteristics of the neighborhood. Using the proposed pricing model, which is based on the assumption of Bertrand competition between retail chains, the authors find that retail margins for gasoline are approximately 21%. The authors also find that consumers are willing to travel up to a mile for a savings of $.03 per liter. Using the estimates of the proposed econometric model, the authors answer policy questions pertaining to a recent merger between two firms in the industry.

Measuring Consumer and Competitive Impact with Elasticity Decompositions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.4.636,01-Nov-07,01-Nov,2007,44,4,636,646,"Marketing investments are designed to change consumer behavior in ways that help goods compete in the marketplace. Previous research has focused on using elasticity decompositions to measure how these investments affect either consumer decision making or competing goods. On the one hand, decision-based decompositions attribute the growth in own-good demand to changes in the consumers’ decision-making processes. On the other hand, unit-based and share-based decompositions attribute the same growth to either rivalrous or nonrivalrous sources. The objective of this article is to provide a clear and accurate method that simultaneously attributes the growth in own-good demand to changes in (1) consumers’ decisions, (2) competitive demand, and (3) competitive market share. The author accomplishes this by settling some confusion about what the decision- and share-based decompositions mean, by discussing how each of the decompositions are related to the others, and by discussing the research questions that each of the decompositions can answer.

Shopper Response to Bundle Promotions for Packaged Goods,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.4.647,01-Nov-07,01-Nov,2007,44,4,647,662,"Bundle promotions—the practice of granting consumers a discount when they buy a certain number of units from a designated range of stockkeeping units—have gained popularity among manufacturers and retailers. In this research, the authors investigate the purchase effects of bundle promotions for a category of packaged goods. Contrary to intuition, they find that promotional bundles are far more effective at inducing switching than at boosting category sales. The strong switching effects result from two mechanisms: (1) Stockkeeping units that are part of a bundle promotion appear to reinforce each other's choice probability, and (2) the bundle discount tends to attract consumers even if they do not buy enough to qualify for the price reduction. The weak category effects follow from the notion that the purchase quantity requirement is often too stringent to make consumers buy earlier and/or more in the category. The authors develop incidence, quantity, and choice models that incorporate the intricate bundle mechanisms, and they use simulations to contrast the sales impact of bundle and traditional per-unit promotions. On the basis of the model estimates, they present managerial implications and tentative guidelines for optimal bundle design.","Bram Foubert, Els Gijsbrechts",,,,,,

This “synergy” effect occurs when the extensions are complementary (e.g., a digital camera and a digital photo printer) but is not evident when they belong to the same category (two models of digital cameras) or to unrelated categories (a digital camera and a snowboard). In addition, the effect is restricted to extension products that are introduced by the same manufacturer. Finally, it occurs only among participants who are promotion focused and therefore are disposed to consider the benefits of owning the extensions rather than the disadvantages of doing so. These and other results suggest that the synergy effect is due to the appeal of completing a set of related products from the same manufacturer rather than the physical or functional similarity of their features to those of either the parent or each other.","Byung Chul Shine, Jongwon Park, Robert S.

The authors find that for promotion-focused adolescents, a promotion-focused positively framed antismoking message is the most effective at persuading them not to smoke; for prevention-focused adolescents, a prevention-focused negatively framed antismoking message is the most effective.

These predictions are confirmed. Furthermore, an analysis of the intensities of these specific emotions reveals the following additional insights: (1) Under conditions in which the options in a choice set meet or exceed both functional and hedonic cutoffs, consumers attach greater importance to the hedonic attribute, and (2) whereas the functionally superior option is preferred in choice tasks, the hedonically superior one is preferred in willingness-to-pay tasks.","Ravindra Chitturi, Rajagopal Raghunathan, Vijay Mahajan",,,,,,

The authors propose that the most promising theoretical mechanism for shopping momentum comes from Gollwitzer's (1990) theory of implementation and deliberation mind-sets. Under this theory, shopping momentum occurs because the initial purchase moves the consumer from a deliberative to an implemental mind-set, thus driving subsequent purchases. After demonstrating the main shopping momentum effect, the authors support the mind-set theory by (1) demonstrating how an initial purchase induces implemental orientation and (2) by illustrating that an implementation mind-set leads to greater purchase. The authors then explore the boundaries of this effect by demonstrating how shopping momentum can be interrupted.

With regard to the form of monitoring, the results from a longitudinal field study of buyer–supplier relationships show that output monitoring decreases partner opportunism, as transaction cost and agency theory predict, whereas behavior monitoring, which is a more obtrusive form of control, increases partner opportunism. With regard to the context, the authors find that informal relationship elements in the form of microlevel social contracts serve as buffers that both enhance the effects of output monitoring and permit behavior monitoring to suppress opportunism in the first place.","Jan B.

Bounded Rationality in Pricing under State-Dependent Demand: Do Firms Look Ahead, and if So, How Far?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.3.434,01-Aug-07,01-Aug,2007,44,3,434,449,"The authors propose an empirical procedure to investigate the pricing behavior of manufacturers and retailers in the presence of state-dependent demand. Rather than assuming that firms are perfectly forward looking and therefore solving accordingly for dynamic equilibriums that would arise in the presence of state dependence, the authors systematically evaluate whether boundedly rational firms indeed look ahead when they set prices and, if so, to what extent. They illustrate the procedure using household-level scanner-panel data on breakfast cereals and replicate the substantive results using data on ketchup. The authors find that (1) omission of state dependence in demand biases inference of firm behavior (i.e., tacit collusion is erroneously inferred when firms are competitive); (2) observed retail prices are consistent with a pricing model in which both manufacturers and retailers are forward looking (i.e., they incorporate the effects of their current prices on their future profits), but firms have short time horizons when setting prices (i.e., they look ahead by only one period, suggesting that firms are boundedly rational in their dynamic pricing behavior); and (3) even a myopic pricing model of firms that accounts for state dependence in demand is a reasonable approximation of the observed prices in the market.","Hai Che, K.

Decomposition of the Sales Impact of Promotion-Induced Stockpiling,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.3.450,01-Aug-07,01-Aug,2007,44,3,450,467,"Promotion-induced consumer stockpiling has a negative impact on manufacturers because it moves forward in time brand sales that would have occurred later at full margin. However, the resultant increase in consumer inventory has two potential benefits: increased category consumption and preemptive brand switches (the additional inventory of the promoted brand preempts the consumer's purchase of a competing brand in the future). Furthermore, there is a potential impact on repeat purchases of the stockpiled brand after the promotion. In this article, the authors present a model and simulation-based method to measure the benefits and costs of stockpiling and assess their relative magnitudes. They find that the benefits are substantial, but consumption appears to be the most important, followed by preemptive switching and then an increase in repeat purchases. These benefits easily offset the negative aspect of consumer stockpiling—namely, purchase acceleration by loyal customers who would have bought the brand at regular price at a later date.","Kusum L.

New Product Preannouncements and Shareholder Value: Don't Make Promises you Can't Keep,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.3.468,01-Aug-07,01-Aug,2007,44,3,468,489,"New product preannouncements are strategic signals that firms direct at their customers, competitors, channel members, and investors. They have been touted as effective means of deterring competitor entry, informing potential customers, and even tipping the balance of technological standard battles in favor of the preannouncing firms. However, preannouncements also carry the risks of unwanted competitive reaction and the negative consequences of undelivered promises. From a shareholder value standpoint, do the benefits outweigh the risks of preannouncing? To address this question, the authors build on agency and signaling theories to develop hypotheses about the effects of preannouncements on shareholder value, and they empirically test these hypotheses on a sample of software and hardware new product preannouncements. The findings indicate that the financial returns from preannouncements are significantly positive in the long run. The authors show that preannouncements generate positive short-term abnormal returns only for firms that offer specific information about the preannounced product. They also show that firms earn positive long-term abnormal returns after a preannouncement if they continue to update the market on the progress of the new product. Both the short-term and the long-term returns are further magnified if the reliability of the preannouncement (i.e., the credibility of the preannouncing firm) is high. The findings offer executives of preannouncing firms clear guidelines on how to manage communications in the market to extract financial value from new product preannouncements.","Alina Sorescu, Venkatesh Shankar, Tarun Kushwaha",,,,,,

They estimate the model on a data set of new car purchases from the entry-luxury segment of the U.S. automobile market. A key finding is that consumers are myopic and prefer contracts with lower payment streams even when they have higher total costs. The authors also find that consumers are more likely to lease than to finance cars with higher maintenance costs because this provides them with the option to return the car before maintenance costs become too high. The authors demonstrate how automobile manufacturers can use the model to evaluate the effectiveness of promotional incentives, such as cash rebates, interest rate subsidies, and increased residual values.","Srabana Dasgupta, S.

Estimating Promotion Response When Competitive Promotions Are Unobservable,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.3.503,01-Aug-07,01-Aug,2007,44,3,503,515,"This study addresses a problem commonly encountered by marketers who attempt to assess the impact of their sales promotions—namely, the lack of data on competitive marketing activity. In most industries, competing firms may have competitive sales data from syndicated services or trade organizations, but they seldom have access to data on competitive promotions at the customer level. Promotion response models in the literature either have ignored competitive promotions, focusing instead on the focal firm's promotions and sales response, or have considered the ideal situation in which the analyst has access to full information about each firm's sales and promotion activity. The authors propose a random coefficients hidden Markov promotion response model, which takes the competitor's unobserved promotion level as a latent variable driven by a Markov process to be estimated simultaneously with the promotion response model. This enables the authors to estimate cross-promotion effects by imputing the level of competitive promotions. The authors test the proposed model on synthetic data through a Monte Carlo experiment. Then, they apply and test the model to actual prescription and sampling data from two main competing pharmaceutical firms in the same therapeutic category. The two tests show that compared with several benchmark models, the proposed random coefficients hidden Markov model successfully imputes unobserved competitive promotions and, accordingly, reduces biases in the own- and cross-promotion parameters. Furthermore, the proposed model provides better predictive validity than the benchmark models.","Sangkil Moon, Wagner A. Kamakura, Johannes Ledolter",3,,,,,
Hedging Your Bets and Assessing the Outcome,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.3.516,01-Aug-07,01-Aug,2007,44,3,516,524,"Hedging offsets the risk of an existing stake by counterbalancing it with a new stake—for example, complementing a bet on the race favorite with another bet on a promising upstart. In three experiments, the authors find that rather than assessing the hedge as a whole, people tend to react to the hedging outcome by focusing on either the original stake or the new one. The authors show that the hedger's focus is linked to a psychological motivation of whether to pursue safety and security by minimizing losses, known as a “prevention orientation,” or to pursue growth and advancement by maximizing gains, known as a “promotion orientation.” When the context is gambling, prevention-oriented people fixate on what happens to the status quo stake, whereas promotion-oriented people attend to the new stake (Experiment 1). The same conclusion emerges from a stock-investing context (Experiments 2a and 2b). Moreover, because selective attention to status quo and change is the mechanism at work, the authors find that a choice between options characterized as maintaining the status quo elicits greater discrimination among prevention-oriented than promotion-oriented people; similarly, a choice between options characterized as initiating change elicits greater discrimination among promotion-oriented than prevention-oriented people (Experiment 3). These effects drive behavioral intentions.","Susan Jung Grant, Ying Xie",,,,,,

They find that only salesperson-owned loyalty, a newly identified construct, directly affects the more tangible seller financial outcomes of sales growth and selling effectiveness, whereas both salesperson-owned loyalty and loyalty to the selling firm increase the customer's willingness to pay a price premium. A longitudinal study verifies that the positive effect of salesperson-owned loyalty on sales growth persists over time. However, because salesperson-owned loyalty simultaneously increases the seller's risk of losing business if the salesperson defects to a competitor, managers need to manage effectively the benefit–risk trade-off. Increasing relationship-enhancing activities and value received by the customer builds both salesperson-owned loyalty and loyalty to the selling firm. The loyalty-building impact of relationship-enhancing activities is moderated by selling-firm consistency and by the selling firm's and salesperson's loyalty-capturing strategies.","Robert W.

Two empirical applications of the approach provide an assessment of its practicality and its predictive performance relative to current methodologies for reservation price elicitation.

Because preferences are often ill-defined, responses to customized offers may depend on how easy it is for consumers to identify the preferences they stated in the measurement task. A series of experiments shows that the likelihood of choosing a personalized recommendation that matches measured preferences most closely is greater with measurement tasks that allow consumers to identify their stated preferences more easily (i.e., transparent tasks). However, this difference in choice likelihood due to task transparency is observed only for novices (versus experts), and making the identification of stated preferences more difficult eliminates the effect by decreasing the choice likelihood following more (versus less) transparent tasks. The author identifies consumers' understanding of their own preferences as the mechanism underlying the task transparency effect. The findings provide evidence that consumers must be able to “see through” or understand the construction of their preferences to maximize utility.",Thomas Kramer,3,,,,,

There is no difference in ownership of products that have been available for many years. Two laboratory experiments further investigate these findings. In Study 2, the authors manipulate regulatory focus and find that when risks associated with a really new product are not specified to consumers, promotion-focused consumers state higher purchase intentions than prevention-focused consumers. However, when the judgmental context makes the risks salient, prevention- and promotion-focused participants are equally unlikely to purchase the product. Study 3 demonstrates that consumers' self-regulation is unrelated to purchase intentions for products that are not portrayed as new. Mediation analyses in both laboratory studies show that the effect of regulatory focus on purchase intentions for new products is due to concerns about the performance of the new technology, which are more pronounced among prevention-focused consumers. Finally, the authors discuss managerial implications.","Michal Herzenstein, Steven S. Posavac, J. Joško Brakus",,,,,,

The authors take an intrapsychic perspective on social desirability and propose that the presence of others––in the absence of direct interaction––leads to the automatic activation of a concern with the impression others are forming. They find that words applicable to social desirability are accessed faster when respondents are in the presence of another person than when they are alone. Across three experiments, semantic (but not perceptual) memory for words and advertisements applicable to social desirability is greater than that for neutral cues after respondents are exposed to these in the actual or imagined presence of others than when they are alone. Respondents' chronic impression management tendencies (self-monitoring) moderate the effects, suggesting that the effects are, at least in part, determined by motivational factors. This novel theoretical framework provides direct implications for advertisers and marketing researchers who rely on recall memory as one of the most common measures of advertising effectiveness.","Stefano Puntoni, Nader T.

In other words, the authors propose a “no-regret” rule in bidding. They impose no other restrictive assumptions on “maximands” or the bidders' behaviors in a competitive auction context. The authors model WTP as having two components: a pure product feature component and one based on the auction market environment. The latter includes bidder experience, seller reputation, and measures for competition among bidders and items. The proposed model is general enough to include a “buy-it-now” (equivalent to a posted price) auction mechanism. The authors use data on notebook auctions from one of the largest Internet auction sites in Korea. They find that most product characteristics matter in the expected ways. There are two additional primary findings: First, WTP declines as more similar items are concurrently listed with the focal item; there is an additional effect if these similar items also belong to the same brand. Therefore, market thickness matters for consumer WTP. Second, more extensive site surfing and bidding histories lead to lower WTP, implying that search costs and experience matter in bidding. As specific substantive benefits, the authors demonstrate how sellers can calculate changes in WTP and, thus, the expected revenue as the number of concurrently available similar items varies.","Tat Y.

The authors contrast the efficacy of comparative and noncomparative new information about a target brand when the initial impression of the brand is positive or negative. A body of extant research shows that positive initial impressions change more in the face of comparative information than when the same information is noncomparative and does not mention a competitor. The authors replicate this effect for positive initial impressions but deduce and show that the opposite is true for negative initial impressions. Thus, the authors show that when evaluations are memory based rather than stimulus based and when the initial evaluation is negative, new information that is noncomparative leads to a greater change in consumer attitudes.

Second, because of regional variation in chain locations and the limited research on the relative effect of chains on market shares, they link chain effects to market shares in France. The authors find that (1) chain effects explain more variation in market share than either time or region effects and (2) the addition of chain effects attenuates region-specific effects. Thus, chain structure is both another source of regional variation in demand and an important consideration in its own right. Finally, by coupling brand–time effects with longer data, the authors note that brand–time effects are larger than brand–region effects in France. This result suggests the importance of long-term effects in marketing and the need to collect longer durations of data to explain variation in market shares.","M. Berk Ataman, Carl F. Mela, Harald J.

They apply such policy simulations to the personal computer market, which is characterized by multiple firms competing through various channels using multiple products.

Competitive Pricing of Information: A Longitudinal Experiment,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.1.042,01-Feb-07,01-Feb,2007,44,1,42,56,"Theoretical work on the pricing of information reveals that competition between independent information sellers can result in prices that are negatively related to the quality or reliability of the information. The theory argues that when information products are unreliable (low quality), independent products become complements, and competition can increase prices. The goal of this study is to test empirically the theory's counterintuitive predictions with the help of an experimental market based on a business simulation. Information products are market forecasts that are available from different competing information sellers; information buyers use these products to make repeated marketing decisions. Sellers set prices to maximize their profit, and buyers decide from which sellers to buy to maximize their own profit (through their marketing decisions). Buyers and sellers are assigned to one of two quality conditions: high-quality, reliable information and low-quality, unreliable information. The reliability of information products (forecasts) is exogenously set and must be inferred by both buyers and sellers from historical forecasts about another market. The results from this experimental market fully support the theory. After some experimentation, prices converge to levels that are strikingly different between the two quality conditions: Prices are significantly higher when the information sold is unreliable (low quality). Moreover, with few competing sellers of low-quality information, prices are higher than with a single seller or with a large number of competing sellers.","Markus Christen, Miklos Sarvary",,,,,,
Why Some Acquisitions Do Better than Others: Product Capital as a Driver of Long-Term Stock Returns,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.1.057,01-Feb-07,01-Feb,2007,44,1,57,72,"Corporate acquisitions are strategic actions that loom large in the minds of many senior managers. Despite decades of study, little systematic research exists on a central question: Why do the acquisitions of some firms perform better than those of others? The work that has examined this question has mostly focused on deal-specific variables (i.e., how the acquisitions are conducted). In this article, the authors highlight a firm-specific, marketing-driven variable—namely, product capital—that affects acquisition performance and predicts which firms are better positioned to acquire in the first place. The authors also present a mechanism by which product capital affects performance— namely, through acquirers' superior selection and deployment of targets' innovation potential. This article shows that firms with high product capital (i.e., those with greater product development and support assets) make smarter acquisition decisions. Such firms are better at selecting targets with innovation potential and then deploying this potential to gain competitive advantage. The performance consequences of this superiority in the selection and deployment of target firms manifest in the long-term financial rewards to the acquiring firm. The results of an analysis of acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry across seven countries and over 11 years (1992–2002) provide empirical support for the arguments.","Alina B.

Is Obesity Caused by Calorie Underestimation? A Psychophysical Model of Meal Size Estimation,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.1.084,01-Feb-07,01-Feb,2007,44,1,84,99,"Calorie underestimation is often alleged to contribute to obesity. By developing a psychophysical model of meal size estimation, the authors show that the association between body mass and calorie underestimation found in health science research is a spurious consequence of the tendency of high-body-mass people to choose—and thus estimate—larger meals. In four studies involving consumers and dieticians, the authors find that the calorie estimations of high- and low-body-mass people follow the same compressive power function; that is, they exhibit the same diminishing sensitivity to meal size changes as the size of the meal increases. The authors also find that using a piecemeal decomposition improves calorie estimation and leads people to choose smaller, but equally satisfying, fast-food meals. The findings that biases in calorie estimation are caused by meal size and not body size have important implications for allegations against the food industry and for the clinical treatment of obesity.","Pierre Chandon, Brian Wansink",8,,,,,
Getting Emotional about Health,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.1.100,01-Feb-07,01-Feb,2007,44,1,100,113,"The consequences of illness have two crucial types of stakes: for the self and for the family. Therefore, this research examines the effectiveness of health messages that present consequences for the self or for the family, focusing specifically on the dual role of emotions in serving these stakes as a provider of resources and information. The authors theorize that (1) the valence dimension of discrete emotions influences resources, thus fostering or hindering the processing of aversive health information, whereas (2) the self-/other-relatedness dimension of discrete emotions provides information that interacts with the focal referent in the message (self or family) to determine compatibility. In Experiments 1–3, the authors demonstrate that when people are primed with a positive emotion (e.g., happiness, peacefulness), the compatibility between the referent and the discrete emotion fosters the processing of health information. When the primed emotion is negative (e.g., sadness, agitation), however, compatibility hinders processing of the message. In Experiment 4, the authors track emotions before and after exposure to a health message to demonstrate that the observed effect occurs because of an increase in the negative emotional state in compatible situations when people process disease-related information. The authors conclude by discussing the implications of the findings for increasing the effectiveness of health-related messages.","Nidhi Agrawal, Geeta Menon, Jennifer L. Aaker",,,,,,

Prior work has attributed this repulsion to perceptions that the offer is inequitable, that it fits others better, or that it suggests that the core product is of low value. In six experiments, the authors show conditions under which exactly the opposite can occur; that is, consumers judge the same offer to be more attractive when a seller offers a better price or more benefits to another group than when the seller treats everyone equally.","Alison K.C.

The authors describe and test two characteristics pertaining to one specific rule that dictates that consumers should not pay for delays, even if they are beneficial: rule invocation and rule override. The results show that money can function as the invoking cue for this rule, that the reliance on this rule can undermine utility maximization, and that this rule may be used as a first response to the decision problem but can be overridden. The article concludes with a discussion of more general applications of such rules, which may explain some of the seemingly systematic inconsistencies in the ways consumers behave.","On Amir, Dan Ariely",9,,,,,
Satisfaction Strength and Customer Loyalty,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.1.153,01-Feb-07,01-Feb,2007,44,1,153,163,"Evidence reveals that many customers who state that they are satisfied with a service provider nevertheless defect. In this article, the authors focus on identifying which customers are vulnerable to defection despite their stated high levels of satisfaction. Building on the recently developed Judgment Uncertainty and Magnitude Parameters (JUMP) model, the authors decompose customers' stated satisfaction into two related but independent facets—satisfaction level and satisfaction strength—and then examine the role of satisfaction strength in the translation of satisfaction into loyalty. Using data from an ongoing customer satisfaction tracking study being conducted by a large U.S.-based service organization, Study 1 examines the role of satisfaction strength in shaping the satisfaction–loyalty link in a business-to-business setting. Study 2, a conceptual replication in a business-to-consumer context, examines the hypothesized relationships in a service failure/recovery situation. The studies strongly demonstrate that satisfaction strength plays a central role in the translation of stated satisfaction into loyalty. A key finding is that though satisfaction translates into loyalty when satisfaction is strongly held (i.e., low uncertainty), the translation is significantly lowered, on average, by approximately 60% when the same satisfaction is more weakly held (i.e., high uncertainty). The studies also indicate that prior relationship aspects (length of relationship, volume of business, and favorability of prior experiences) result in even greater vulnerability.","Murali Chandrashekaran, Kristin Rotte, Stephen S.

The Effect of Stating Expectations on Customer Satisfaction and Shopping Experience,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.1.164,01-Feb-07,01-Feb,2007,44,1,164,174,"Customers' expectations are key determinants of their consumption experiences, satisfaction, and loyalty. The authors examine alternative theoretical predictions about the impact of stating expectations before purchase on postpurchase perceptions of the shopping experience and the firm. In particular, the authors suggest that asking customers to articulate their expectations can backfire and lead to lower postpurchase evaluations of the shopping and consumption experience. A series of field experiments indicate that compared with a control group, stating prepurchase expectations leads customers to focus on negative aspects of the shopping experience and perceive the same performance more negatively. The tendency for consumers to rate their shopping experiences less favorably after stating prepurchase expectations is inconsistent with confirmation bias as well as assimilation, contrast, and positivity effects. The final study contrasts the impact of stating expectations about the next store shopping experience with the impact of evaluating the store's past performance. The results show that though (prepurchase) expectations are indistinguishable from evaluations of the store's past performance, the former leads to lower postpurchase than prepurchase evaluations, whereas the latter tends to generate higher postpurchase evaluations. The article concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of this research.","Chezy Ofir, Itamar Simonson",3,,,,,

Using data on all promotions offered in 2003 by CVS, a leading U.S. drug retailer, the authors (1) quantify the gross promotional lift; (2) decompose this into switching, stockpiling, and incremental lift for the retailer; (3) estimate the extent to which promotion affects sales of other product categories in the store to compute the net unit impact of the promotion; (4) account for promotional and nonpromotional margins and manufacturer funding to compute the net profit impact of the promotion; and (5) examine how promotion, brand, category, and store characteristics influence the net impact. The authors find that approximately 45% of the gross lift is incremental for CVS, and there is also a significant, positive halo effect on sales of other categories. However, on average, the net profit impact of promotions is negative because CVS's promotional margin is often substantially less than regular margin. In the authors' analysis of the correlates of net impact, they find that many promotion and brand characteristics have opposing associations with net unit and net profit impact. Deep, featured promotions on high “consumer-pull” brands generate high net unit impact, but they significantly reduce CVS's promotional margin, resulting in lower net profit impact. Therefore, the retailer must make some difficult trade-offs between revenue and profit objectives in promotion decisions.","Kusum L. Ailawadi, Bari A. Harlam, Jacques César,...",,,
The Short- and Long-Term Impact of an Assortment Reduction on Category Sales,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.4.536,01-Nov-06,01-Nov,2006,43,4,536,548,"In a collaborative study with a major Dutch retailer, the authors assess the short- and long-term effects of a 25% item reduction on category sales. On an aggregate level, a major assortment reduction can lead to substantive short-term category sales losses but only a weak negative long-term category sales effect. Short-term category sales losses are caused mainly by fewer category purchases by former buyers of delisted detergent items. However, the results also show that the assortment reduction attracts new category buyers. These new buyers partially offset the sales losses among former buyers of the delisted items. The collection of supplemental process data on assortment perceptions and actual search time in the test stores before and after the assortment reduction provides evidence that delisting results in an increase in perceived search efficiency and a decrease in actual search time.","Laurens M.

A Three-Stage Model of Integrated Marketing Communications at the Marketing-Sales Interface,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.4.564,01-Nov-06,01-Nov,2006,43,4,564,579,"The marketing and sales functions in many firms are often at odds despite their common goal of increasing revenue and profit. The finger pointing goes both ways: Marketing complains of poor lead follow-up by sales, and in turn, sales grumbles about the quality of leads generated by marketing. This disconnect can be damaging; high lead volumes generated through effective marketing campaigns could actually hurt downstream sales because of wasted effort on poorly qualified leads and/or delays in sales follow-up resulting from limited sales force capacity. To examine the revenue and profit implications of coordinated communications efforts at the marketing-sales interface, the authors develop a three-stage model that captures the effects of sequential marketing/sales communications on lead generation, appointment conversion, and sales closure. The results, which are based on a collaborative effort with a large home improvement retailer, suggest a complex interplay among marketing efforts (multiple media that generate leads), delays in follow-up (time lag between inquiry and sales force contact), and sales efficiencies (appointment and sales conversion). The findings underscore the impact of multimedia spending on the timing and effectiveness of subsequent communications, implying that improved internal collaboration between marketing and sales can offer significant upside potential for the firm. Finally, the authors develop a managerial decision support tool to simulate the impact of varying communications budgets, timing, and allocation on the marketing and sales planning system.","Timothy M.

The findings indicate that buyer-salesperson and firm-firm relationships have a greater influence on new product acceptance when a new product's attractiveness is modest than when the new product is very unattractive or very attractive. At modest levels of product attractiveness, the likelihood of new product acceptance can increase by as much as 60% when the buyer has a strong relationship with the salesperson.

Optimal Pricing Strategies for an Automotive Aftermarket Retailer,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.4.588,01-Nov-06,01-Nov,2006,43,4,588,604,"The extant retail category pricing optimization literature concentrates on grocery retailing. In contrast, this article focuses on the problem of determining profit-improving store-level prices of failure-related “hard-part” product categories at a U.S. specialty automotive part retailer with 3400 stores. There are some key institutional differences between automotive hard-part and grocery retailing: No syndicated data are available for hard parts; each subclass of a hard-part category contains variants that are ordered by quality (typically “Good,” “Better,” “Best”); there is intra- but no intersubclass competition; market shares of variants and their prices are not positively correlated within a subclass; a consumer enters the market only infrequently; and at a purchase occasion, a consumer buys one and only one variant within a subclass and one and only one unit of that variant. Using two years of weekly sales histories from 800 stores, the authors develop store-level demand models for 23 subclasses of a hard part and employ these with available product cost data to set prices of variants of each subclass at each store that increase profit. The authors test the model-recommended prices for 10 subclasses in a field experiment involving 500 stores, leading to a projection of an annual increase of more than $610,000 in the retailer's profit from these 10 subclasses if the new prices are applied at all stores. The empirical analysis also yields new insights into asymmetric price competition across quality variants and deviations of actual from optimal prices that run counter to previous grocery retailing-based findings.","Murali K.

Three studies show that low-fat labels lead all consumers—particularly those who are overweight—to overeat snack foods. Furthermore, salient objective serving-size information (e.g., “Contains 2 Servings”) reduces overeating among guilt-prone, normal-weight consumers but not among overweight consumers.

These results are robust to using monetary and nonmonetary outcomes, as well as to different time horizons (months, days).

The three experiments reported in this article examine reasons that underlie urges that strengthen over time and cause people to overindulge from a goal-theoretic view of impulsiveness. The authors demonstrate that impulsivity is characterized by generalized reward sensitivity and by an activation of chronic goals to seek pleasure in various domains (Experiment 1). Furthermore, through a moment-to-moment tracking of desires, the authors demonstrate that such chronic goals, particularly in conjunction with temporarily primed goals, provide the momentum for impulsive people to override their self-control goals, leading to a strengthening of desires over time (Experiment 2). In turn, this causes impulsive people to behave even more impulsively when their activated hedonic goals are not satiated (Experiment 3). The findings suggest that contextual cues have powerful influences on impulsive behavior over time when acting in conjunction with chronic hedonic goals. The results have public policy implications for behaviors such as binge drinking and unrestrained eating.","Suresh Ramanathan, Geeta Menon",1,,,,,

Experiment 1 shows that the tendency to deemphasize prescreening information leads to systematically different choices for decision makers who screen alternatives compared with decision makers who do not screen alternatives. Additional studies show that screening encourages decision makers to shift their emphasis from prescreening information to postscreening information (Experiment 2). Prescreening information is deemphasized because of the categorization that occurs when people create a consideration set of retained alternatives (Experiments 3 and 4). Together, the results show that a brand's strength of consideration (i.e., how highly an option ranks on screening criteria) may have little influence on the likelihood of it being chosen in a postscreening choice process.","Amitav Chakravarti, Chris Janiszewski, Gülden Ülkümen",,,,,,

In contrast, other firms are proactively involved in designing customized solutions to individual customer needs.

The authors develop a conceptual model that contends that the appropriate level of vendor control over the customization decision is a function of technology and knowledge considerations. They use data on 304 procurement arrangements for customized products to test their hypotheses and to explore the normative ramifications for three key measures of performance: closeness of the delivered product to customer needs, delivery performance, and the vendor's operating profits. The results show that contracting parties choose the level of vendor control over customization in a strategic and discriminating way to enhance the benefits from customization for both parties.

The results show empirically, in a field setting, that the product attributes evaluated in Stage 1 differ from those evaluated in Stage 2. Consistent with existing theory, consumers tend to use simpler decision rules based on a subset of attribute information in earlier stages. The author also finds some preliminary evidence that attributes such as price and size tend to be considered in only one of the two stages, whereas ingredient attributes tend to be considered in both stages.

Controlling for salesperson gender and selling experience, structural equation modeling indicates that ASB increases self-rated, manager-rated, and objective measures of performance, whereas CO increases only self-rated performance. Both ASB and CO increase job satisfaction. Tests of reciprocal relationships indicate that ASB increases CO and job satisfaction increases performance rather than vice versa. Selling experience increases performance but not job satisfaction, and saleswomen rate their performance and satisfaction slightly higher than salesmen do.

Marketing models are usually applications of standard economic theories, which rely on strong assumptions of rationality of consumers and firms. Behavioral economics explores the implications of the limits of rationality, with the goal of making economic theories more plausible by explaining and predicting behavior more accurately while maintaining formal power. This article reviews six behavioral economics models that are useful to marketing. Three models generalize standard preference structures to allow for sensitivity to reference points and loss aversion, social preferences toward outcomes of others, and preference for instant gratification. The other three models generalize the concept of game-theoretic equilibrium, allowing decision makers to make mistakes, encounter limits on the depth of strategic thinking, and equilibrate by learning from feedback. The authors also discuss a specific marketing application for each of these six models. The goal of this article is to encourage marketing researchers to apply these models. Doing so will raise technical challenges for modelers and will require thoughtful input from psychologists who study consumer behavior. Consequently, such models could create a common language both for modelers who prize formality and for psychologists who prize realism.","Teck H. Ho, Noah Lim, Colin F. Camerer",,,,,,

The first question is whether behavioral economics is, in reality, a new form of theoretical psychology, competing with existing psychological models and theories and subject to the same vulnerability to evidence as applies to psychological theory. The author argues that behavioral economists are ambivalent about this point, sometimes claiming psychological realism or plausibility as a necessary modeling requirement and other times introducing assumptions for modeling convenience. The second question is whether the impact of behavioral economics on marketing will be experienced more strongly through the development of new quantitative models or through the exploration of qualitative lessons stimulated by behavioral violations of rationality. It is argued that behavioral economics not only contributes new modeling instruments but, through its documentation of rationality violations or “anomalies,” can provide a rich source of intuitions and insights into consumer psychology as well.",Drazen Prelec,,,,,,

For the widely studied EachMovie data, the authors find that missing data are strongly nonignorable. Recommendation quality is improved substantially by jointly modeling “selection” and “ratings,” both whether and how an item is rated. Accounting for missing ratings and various sources of heterogeneity offers a rich portrait of which items are rated well, which are rated at all, and how these processes are intertwined, while reducing holdout error by 10% or more.

Between Two Brands: A Goal Fluency Account of Brand Evaluation,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.3.374,01-Aug-06,01-Aug,2006,43,3,374,385,"The authors present the results of two studies that show how consumers' evaluations of an advertised product can be influenced by the compatibility or conflict between the regulatory goals (promotion or prevention) addressed by the product and prior advertising of related products. Participants across both studies were exposed sequentially to the advertising of two products (prime and target), and they demonstrated a regulatory goal fluency effect in their evaluations of the target brand. When the regulatory goal serviced by the target matched (conflicted with) the regulatory goal serviced by the prime, participants indicated higher (lower) purchase intent (Experiment 1) and more favorable evaluations of the target brand (Experiment 2). These effects were not accounted for by differences in participants' involvement or affective state across the conditions. Instead, mediation analyses show that participants' ease of processing the target advertisement underlies the effect of goal compatibility on brand evaluation.","Aparna A. Labroo, Angela Y.

Is Happiness Shared Doubled and Sadness Shared Halved? Social Influence on Enjoyment of Hedonic Experiences,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.3.386,01-Aug-06,01-Aug,2006,43,3,386,394,"Because many hedonic stimuli (e.g., movies, vacations, food) are often consumed in the company of other people, it is important to know how social influence affects the enjoyment of shared experiences. Extrapolation from informational and normative influences suggests that enjoyment is enhanced when others offer positive opinions and diminished when they offer negative opinions about shared stimuli. In this article, the authors propose an alternative model. Building on the need to belong and the need for accuracy, the authors predict that enjoyment from sharing stimuli depends on consumers' perceived interpersonal agreements about the shared stimuli, such that congruence of opinions enhances and incongruence of opinions diminishes the enjoyment of the shared experience. The results from three experiments support the authors' predictions and indicate that under some circumstances, social influence can operate in opposite directions on judgments of shared stimuli and on the enjoyment of sharing them.","Rajagopal Raghunathan, Kim Corfman",,,,,,
When Does Culture Matter? Effects of Personal Knowledge on the Correction of Culture-Based Judgments,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.3.395,01-Aug-06,01-Aug,2006,43,3,395,408,"Four experiments demonstrate that culture-based differences in persuasion arise when a person processes information in a cursory, spontaneous manner, but these differences dissipate when a person's intuitions are supplemented by more deliberative processing. North Americans are persuaded more by promotion-focused information, and Chinese people are persuaded more by prevention-focused information, but only when initial, automatic reactions to messages are given. Corrections to these default judgments occur when processing is thoughtful. These results underscore the idea that culture does not exert a constant, unwavering effect on consumer judgments. A key factor in determining whether culture-based effects loom large or fade is the extent to which a person draws on cultural versus more personal knowledge when he or she is forming judgments.","Donnel A.

They make use of Bayesian design methods that integrate the optimality criteria over a prior distribution of likely parameter values. They employ a modified Fedorov algorithm to generate the optimal choice designs. They also discuss other aspects of the designs, such as level overlap, utility balance, estimation performance, and computational effectiveness.","Roselinde Kessels, Peter Goos, Martina Vandebroek",3,,,,,
Models for Heterogeneous Variable Selection,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.3.420,01-Aug-06,01-Aug,2006,43,3,420,430,"Preference heterogeneity is a major research stream in marketing aimed at quantifying and understanding the diversity of demand for product attributes and attribute levels. In experimental settings, in which consumers are presented with simple descriptions of product offerings, continuous distributions of heterogeneity, such as the multivariate normal, provide a useful representation of preference. However, in more complex cases in which respondents have value for only a few of the benefits associated with an offering or cognitive constraints that result in selective attention to a subset of the information available, continuous distributions of heterogeneity do not reflect the possibility that a subset of the variables has nonzero effect sizes for different respondents. Identifying which attributes are used in a brand choice decision is closely related to the statistical procedure of variable selection. This article extends variable selection methods to accommodate heterogeneity across consumers and data contexts, conditions frequently encountered in marketing studies. The authors apply the methods to a discrete-choice conjoint study in which data are collected in both full-profile and partial-profile formats.","Timothy J. Gilbride, Greg M. Allenby, Jeff D.

First, the authors focus attention on the trait-state distinction and present a model that separates stable sources of substantive variation in a construct from transient sources. Second, the authors develop a classification of measurement error that distinguishes six types of error on the basis of (1) whether the error is stable or transient and (2) whether the error affects individual items, subsets of items, or all items in a scale. They also show how these errors can be modeled using a factor-analytic specification. Third, the authors argue that marketing researchers should make the means of scale items an explicit component of measurement analysis and should test for the invariance of item loadings and intercepts as a prerequisite for meaningful comparisons of scale means across samples and over time. To illustrate the benefits of the proposed procedure, the authors present an extended application of the model to the constructs of brand loyalty and deal proneness.","Hans Baumgartner, Jan-Benedict E.M.

The model consists of a vector autoregression that is rewritten in error correction format, which allows the authors to disentangle the immediate effects from the dynamic effects. In a second level of the model, the immediate price elasticities, the cumulative promotional price elasticity, and the long-term regular price elasticity are correlated with various brand-specific and category-specific characteristics. The model is applied to seven years of data on weekly sales of 100 different brands in 25 product categories. The authors find many significant moderating effects on the elasticity of price promotions. Brands in categories that are characterized by high price differentiation and that constitute a lower share of budget are less sensitive to price discounts. Deep price discounts increase the immediate price sensitivity of customers. The authors also find significant effects for the cumulative elasticity. The immediate effect of a regular price change is often close to zero. The long-term effect of such a regular price decrease usually amounts to an increase in sales. This is especially true in categories that are characterized by a large price dispersion and frequent price promotions and for hedonic, nonperishable products.","Dennis Fok, Csilla Horváth, Richard Paap,...",,,,,,

The Periodicity of Pricing,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.3.477,01-Aug-06,01-Aug,2006,43,3,477,493,"Retail pricing data combine multiple decisions (e.g., regular pricing and discounting) that are possibly made by multiple decision makers (e.g., retailers and manufacturers). For example, temporary price reductions (high-frequency price changes) can be used to price discriminate in the short run, whereas regular price adjustments (low-frequency price changes) might reflect changes in long-term costs or demand. Time disaggregation cannot disentangle these factors, because frequency aggregation exists even when data are analyzed at the lowest possible level of temporal aggregation. Because little is known about the nature of pricing interactions across various planning cycles, this article develops several empirical generalizations about the role of periodicity in pricing. Using week-store stockkeeping-unit-level price data in 35 grocery categories, the authors find that (1) cross-brand correlation in prices occurs at multiple planning horizons, and the planning horizon of the predominant interaction does not typically coincide with the sampling rate of the data; (2) aggregating pricing interactions across frequencies obscures distinct and different interactions; (3) pricing interactions are related to category- and brand-specific factors, such as mean interpurchase times; (4) regular price changes explain most of the variation in prices; and (5) periodicity can affect inferences about the nature of competition within a category. The authors conclude by discussing several practical marketing applications for which marketing decisions across frequencies have relevance.","Bart J. Bronnenberg, Carl F.

In this research, the authors study the ability of firms to convert ideas into products, that is, their conversion ability. Specifically, they address the question, Why are some firms better at conversion than others? In contrast to much of the existing literature, the authors propose that a strong focus on speed and on generating many ideas may actually hurt firms by lowering their conversion ability. The authors test their arguments on data between 1960 and 2001 from a cross-national sample of pharmaceutical firms. They find that firms vary widely in their ability to convert promising drug ideas into launched drugs. Firms with the highest conversion ability are those that (1) focus on a moderate number of ideas, in areas of importance, and in areas in which they have expertise and (2) deliberate for a moderate length of time on promising ideas.","Rajesh Chandy, Brigitte Hopstaken, Om Narasimhan,...",,,,,,

The economic rationale for slotting allowances is controversial. Supporters argue that slotting allowances are efficiency enhancing; critics argue that they are anticompetitive. However, there is no empirical research on this issue because of the difficulty in obtaining data about these transactions. Using data on all new products that were offered to one retailer for a period of nine months, the authors empirically investigate support for the alternative rationales for slotting allowances. The analysis indicates that, in general, there is more support for the efficiency theories than for the anticompetitive theories. The authors find that slotting allowances (1) efficiently allocate scarce retail shelf space, (2) help balance the risk of new product failure between manufacturers and retailers, (3) help manufacturers signal private information about potential success of new products, and (4) widen retail distribution for manufacturers by mitigating retail competition. The authors find little support for the anticompetitive rationales in the data. The empirical support for the efficiency rationales suggests that the Federal Trade Commission was correct in being circumspect about banning slotting allowances outright.","K. Sudhir, Vithala R.

Price Matching by Vertically Differentiated Retailers: Theory and Evidence,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.2.156,01-May-06,01-May,2006,43,2,156,167,"This research examines vertically differentiated retailers' incentives to offer price-matching guarantees. It suggests that offering and not offering a price-matching guarantee are both signals of a retailer's service-price profile, a way of branding the retailer to uninformed consumers. The signals are made credible and costless by the presence of informed consumers. The authors show that when the service differentiation is large enough, only low-service retailers offer price-matching guarantees. Data from a sample of Canadian retail chains support this prediction. In addition, larger retail chains are more likely to offer price-matching guarantees than smaller chains, and competition has an interactive effect with service. As the intensity of competition a chain faces increases, lower-service retailers are even more likely to use a guarantee, and higher-service retailers are less likely to do so, suggesting that price-matching guarantees are competitive tools, not collusive tools, as the literature has often implied.","Sridhar Moorthy, Xubing Zhang",,,,,,

The authors address this issue for the automobile retailing industry with matched survey and transaction data on 1500 car purchases in California. They show that the Internet lowers prices for two distinct reasons: First, the Internet informs consumers about dealers' invoice prices. Second, the referral process of online buying services helps consumers obtain lower prices. The combined information and referral price effects are −1.5%, or 22% of dealers' average gross vehicle profit. The authors also find that the benefits of gathering information differ by consumer type. Buyers who have a high disutility of bargaining but who have collected information on the specific car they eventually purchase pay 1.5% less than they otherwise would. In contrast, buyers who like the bargaining process do not benefit from such information.","Florian Zettelmeyer, Fiona Scott Morton, Jorge Silva-Risso",6,,,,,

The authors use a random effects model to determine the impact of these factors on site duration and the number of pages viewed. The proposed method accounts for three distinct sources of heterogeneity that arise from differences among people, Web sites, and visit occasions to the same Web site by the same person. The model is fit using one month of user-centric panel data, and it encompasses the 50 most popular sites in a market. The results show that, in general, older people and women visit Web sites for a longer period. Some surprising results are revealed in an examination of interactions between these demographic and site characteristic variables. For example, sites with higher levels of advertising usually result in lower visit duration, but this is not the case for older people. The model also yields insights into the relative importance of different sources of heterogeneity in visit duration; heterogeneity in visit occasions dominates over individual-level and Web site-specific heterogeneity.","Peter J.

Second, models have staying power. They suffer very little decrease in performance if they are used to predict churn for a database compiled three months after the calibration data.

Yet there is evidence that many users prefer a flat rate even though their billing rate would be lower with a pay-per-use tariff (flat-rate bias), and some users prefer a pay-per-use tariff even though they would save money with a flat rate (pay-per-use bias). The authors conduct four empirical analyses based on three different data sets. They show that the flat-rate bias is more important and has a greater regularity and time persistence than the pay-per-use bias. They classify potential causes of the flat-rate bias as “insurance effect,” “taxi meter effect,” “convenience effect,” and “overestimation effect” and show that the insurance, the taxi meter, and the overestimation effects lead to a flat-rate bias. They provide evidence that underestimation of usage is a major cause of the pay-per-use bias. They show that the flat-rate bias does not significantly increase customer churn and thus results in a short- and long-term profit increase. In contrast, the pay-per-use bias largely increases churn so that in the long run, the additional short-term profit is offset by higher churn.","Anja Lambrecht, Bernd Skiera",26,,,
The Impact of Standards Competition on Consumers: Effectiveness of Product Information and Advertising Formats,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.2.224,01-May-06,01-May,2006,43,2,224,236,"Compared with other markets, those with competing technological standards exhibit certain fundamental characteristics that make a consumer's decision to adopt a new product more risky and more complex. This article examines how standards competition affects consumer behavior, an issue that has been relatively neglected by previous research in this area. The results show that consumers depend on different types of information in their adoption decisions and respond differently to advertising. Specifically, the authors find that standards competition motivates consumers to pay more attention to information that is comparative in nature. Thus, information about the relative (absolute) performance of a product has a stronger (weaker) impact on a product's share in markets with standards competition (Study 1). Standards competition also moderates the effectiveness of different advertising formats: It strengthens the effect of comparative advertisements but weakens the effect of noncomparative advertisements (Study 2). As a result, two commonly observed drawbacks of comparative advertisements—negative attitude toward the ad and source confusion—disappear in the presence of standards competition (Study 2), and comparative advertisements even induce greater confidence in the advertised brand (Study 3). Finally, in the presence of standards competition, the superiority of comparative advertisements is stronger when the advertised brand has a disadvantage in terms of brand familiarity than when it has an advantage (Study 3). This research takes a step toward a better understanding of these important but underexplored issues and provides managerial insights for firms that launch new products in markets with competing standards.","Amitav Chakravarti, Jinhong Xie",,,,,,

Furthermore, the authors obtain empirical findings in two major areas: First, variation in similarity ratings can be explained by the advertisements' features, a finding of potential importance for advertisement construction. Second, some, but not all, executional elements that have been shown (in the literature) to drive recall and persuasion are effective at driving perceptions of similarity. This is of practical importance because managers want their advertisements not only to be liked and remembered but also (possibly) to be perceived as similar (or dissimilar) to those for other products. In particular, an understanding of which items drive which constructs (recall and persuasion, or similarity) can contribute to a more effective overall marketing strategy.","David A.

The authors show that a prior choice, which activates and boosts a positive self-concept, subsequently licenses the choice of a more self-indulgent option. The authors propose that licensing can operate by committing to a virtuous act in a preceding choice, which reduces negative self-attributions associated with the purchase of relative luxuries. Five studies demonstrate the proposed licensing effect of a prior commitment to a virtuous act on subsequent choice. Consistent with the authors' theory, the preference for an indulgent option diminishes if the licensing task is attributed to an external motivation.

The authors find evidence of such an effect both at the release phase across movies and over the postrelease phase for any movie.

It is proposed that regulatory fit changes the significance of consumers' reactions to something, including the perceived monetary value of a choice they have made or the persuasiveness of a message they have received. When there is a fit, people engage more strongly in and “feel right” about what they are doing, and subsequent evaluative reactions (positive or negative) can be intensified by this fit experience. The fit experience is shown to influence the strength of value experiences independent of hedonic experiences. The authors discuss how the fit effect on value is distinct from other factors that affect value, such as relevancy, matching, hedonic mood, and arousal.

Second, the authors discuss possible boundary conditions of regulatory fit effects, highlighting the apparent paradoxical role of involvement. They suggest that the antecedents that give rise to regulatory fit (e.g., lowered motivation) can differ from its consequences (e.g., increased motivation). Third, the authors discuss broader implications of regulatory fit, proposing three possible mechanisms by which regulatory fit can lead to improved physical health and discussing the degree to which the just-right feeling plays a role in goal-sustaining experiences related to subjective well-being (e.g., flow).","Jennifer L.

Feelings, Fit, and Funny Effects: A Situated Cognition Perspective,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.1.20,01-Feb-06,01-Feb,2006,43,1,20,23,"Recent research has documented numerous, apparently irrational influences on consumer judgment and choice, from the influence of temporary moods and metacognitive experiences to the role of “feeling right” about a decision strategy. From the metatheoretical perspective of situated cognition, such findings reflect the pragmatic, situated, and embodied nature of human cognition, which usually serves people well. Avnet and Higgins's (2006) target article extends the understanding of these processes by identifying the metacognitive experience of feeling right and by emphasizing the role of self-regulatory focus in judgment and decision making.",Norbert Schwarz,,,,

The Role of Regulatory Focus in Preference Construction,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.1.28,01-Feb-06,01-Feb,2006,43,1,28,38,"The authors examine how consumers' regulatory focus affects their information search behavior and decision-making process. The results show that uninvolved research participants rely on their regulatory focus as a filter to process information selectively. Participants paid more attention to and based their product evaluation on product information that is relevant to their regulatory concerns, but only when they were not motivated to process information. This regulatory fit effect on evaluation seems to be driven by the perceptual salience of fit versus nonfit information and is more consistent with heuristic than with systematic processing of information.","Jing Wang, Angela Y.

The Goal-Gradient Hypothesis Resurrected: Purchase Acceleration, Illusionary Goal Progress, and Customer Retention,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.1.39,01-Feb-06,01-Feb,2006,43,1,39,58,"The goal-gradient hypothesis denotes the classic finding from behaviorism that animals expend more effort as they approach a reward. Building on this hypothesis, the authors generate new propositions for the human psychology of rewards. They test these propositions using field experiments, secondary customer data, paper-and-pencil problems, and Tobit and logit models. The key findings indicate that (1) participants in a real café reward program purchase coffee more frequently the closer they are to earning a free coffee; (2) Internet users who rate songs in return for reward certificates visit the rating Web site more often, rate more songs per visit, and persist longer in the rating effort as they approach the reward goal; (3) the illusion of progress toward the goal induces purchase acceleration (e.g., customers who receive a 12-stamp coffee card with 2 preexisting “bonus” stamps complete the 10 required purchases faster than customers who receive a “regular” 10-stamp card); and (4) a stronger tendency to accelerate toward the goal predicts greater retention and faster reengagement in the program. The conceptualization and empirical findings are captured by a parsimonious goal-distance model, in which effort investment is a function of the proportion of original distance remaining to the goal. In addition, using statistical and experimental controls, the authors rule out alternative explanations for the observed goal gradients. They discuss the theoretical significance of their findings and the managerial implications for incentive systems, promotions, and customer retention.","Ran Kivetz, Oleg Urminsky, Yuhuang Zheng",47,,,
Discount Rates for Time versus Dates: The Sensitivity of Discounting to Time-Interval Description,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.1.59,01-Feb-06,01-Feb,2006,43,1,59,72,"Six experiments examine the impact of time-interval descriptions on consumers' discount rates. Consumers exhibit more discounting (e.g., they demand more money to delay income) when delay intervals are described by extents of time than when delay intervals are described by dates. This pattern holds in various contexts, including gains and losses, and is robust to response-mode changes. Findings further indicate that this effect may arise because, compared with date descriptions, extent descriptions enhance perceptions of interval length. The author discusses other potential mechanisms and implications.",Robyn A. Leboeuf,,,,,,
A Direct Approach to Data Fusion,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.1.73,01-Feb-06,01-Feb,2006,43,1,73,83,"The generic data fusion problem is to make inferences about the joint distribution of two sets of variables without any direct observations of the joint distribution. Instead, information is available only for each set separately along with some other set of common variables. The standard approach to data fusion creates a fused data set with the variables of interest and the common variables. This article develops an approach that directly estimates the joint distribution of just the variables of interest. For the case of either discrete or continuous variables, the approach yields a solution that can be implemented with standard statistical models and software. In typical marketing applications, the common variables are psychographic or demographic variables, and the variables to be fused involve media viewing and product purchase. For this example, the approach directly estimates the joint distribution of media viewing and product purchase without including the common variables. This is the object required for marketing decisions. In marketing applications, fusion of discrete variables is required. The authors develop a method for relaxing the assumption of conditional independence for this case. They illustrate their approach with product-purchase and media-viewing data from a large survey of British consumers.","Zvi Gilula, Robert E. McCulloch, Peter E. Rossi",,,,,,
Channel Bargaining with Retailer Asymmetry,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.1.84,01-Feb-06,01-Feb,2006,43,1,84,97,"Manufacturers of consumer products often complain of lower profits in light of the growing channel dominance of retailers such as Wal-Mart, Home Depot, and other “power retailers.” The authors argue that this complaint might not be valid. In an analytical model of competing manufacturers and competing multiproduct retailers, the authors show that manufacturers may actually experience increased profits when a retailer gains an exogenous cost advantage over its rival retailer. Potential channel efficiencies exist when retailing costs are reduced. The authors illustrate that channel transactions based on bilateral bargaining capture these efficiencies by transferring market share to the more efficient retailer, thus increasing channel profits. In a bargaining relationship between a manufacturer and a retailer, the manufacturer realizes some of these enhanced efficiencies. The authors discuss the managerial implications for pricing in channels.","Anthony J. Dukes, Esther Gal-Or, Kannan Srinivasan",3,,,,,
The Effect of Banner Advertising on Internet Purchasing,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.1.98,01-Feb-06,01-Feb,2006,43,1,98,108,"This article focuses on whether banner advertising affects purchasing patterns on the Internet. Using a behavioral database that consists of customer purchases at a Web site along with individual advertising exposure, the authors measure the impact of banner advertising on current customers' probabilities of repurchase, while accounting for duration dependence. The authors model the probability of a current customer making a purchase in any given week (since the last purchase) with a survival model that uses a flexible, piecewise exponential hazard function. The advertising covariates are purely advertising variables and advertising/individual browsing variables. The model is cast in a hierarchical Bayesian framework, which enables the authors to obtain individual advertising response parameters. The results show that the number of exposures, number of Web sites, and number of pages all have a positive effect on repeat purchase probabilities, whereas the number of unique creatives has a negative effect. Returns from targeting are the highest for the number of advertising exposures. The findings also add to the general advertising literature by showing that advertising affects the purchase behavior of current (versus new) customers.","Puneet Manchanda, Jean-Pierre Dubé, Khim Yong Goh,...",6,,,,,
How Customer Self-Determination Influences Relational Marketing Outcomes: Evidence from Longitudinal Field Studies,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.1.109,01-Feb-06,01-Feb,2006,43,1,109,120,"This article examines the role of customers' self-determination, defined as a person's perception of joining a firm on his or her own initiative versus being induced to join, in influencing relational outcomes for firms. In the first two studies, the author finds evidence of more relational behaviors (Studies 1 and 2) and higher motivation levels regarding purchase (Study 2) among self-determined (versus firm-determined) customers. This article also examines how customers' self-determination interacts with two types of relational marketing programs: reminder coupons, which consumers view as relatively more controlling, and relational rewards, which they view as relatively more informative of their value to the firm. The results reveal that sending a stylized reminder coupon to encourage repeat purchase has negative effects (Study 3) and that automatic enrollment in a relational rewards program has positive effects on relational behaviors of self-determined customers (Study 4). Firm-determined customers are less influenced by rewards in both cases. These findings question the effectiveness of aggressive acquisition and reminder marketing programs in cultivating customer relationships, provide a straightforward way to identify attractive relational candidates in consumer settings, and suggest methods by which to (and how not to) market to self-determined consumers.",Utpal M.

Household Life Cycles and Lifestyles in the United States,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.1.121,01-Feb-06,01-Feb,2006,43,1,121,132,"Household life cycle has been widely used as a determinant of consumer behavior and a basis for market segmentation. However, there is considerable disagreement about how life stages should be defined and how households progress through these stages. Existing studies use a priori definitions, which are tested on a cross-sectional survey of households collected at a single point in time and thus cannot reveal the real dynamics of the household life cycle. The Panel Study of Income Dynamics provides longitudinal data on household composition in the United States for a period of 34 years; the authors use this to identify empirically the most typical stages and paths that U.S. households have followed since 1968. They develop a hidden Markov model in which the stages of the household life cycle are taken as latent, unobservable states that are uncovered from the manifest household demographic profiles over the 34 years, assuming that households evolve through these latent stages following a first-order Markov process. The authors apply their results to classify members of another panel (Consumer Expenditure Survey) into life stages, which enables them to study the impact of the household life cycle on households' budgetary allocations, providing a comprehensive analysis of lifestyles (through expenditure patterns) over the household life cycle.","Rex Y.
