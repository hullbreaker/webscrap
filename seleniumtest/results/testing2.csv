Extremity Bias in Online Reviews: The Role of Attrition,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211073579,16-May-22,01-Aug-22,59,4,675,695,"In a range of studies across platforms, researchers have shown that online ratings are characterized by distributions with disproportionately heavy tails. The authors of this study focus on understanding the underlying process that yields such “J-shaped” or “extreme” distributions. They propose a novel theoretical mechanism behind the emergence of J-shaped distributions: differential attrition, or the idea that potential reviewers with moderate experiences are more likely to leave the pool of active reviewers than potential reviewers with extreme experiences. The authors present an analytical model that integrates this mechanism with two extant mechanisms: differential utility and base rates. They show that although all three mechanisms can give rise to extreme distributions, only the utility-based and attrition-based mechanisms can explain the authors’ empirical observation from a large-scale field experiment that an unincentivized solicitation email from an online travel platform reduces review extremity. Subsequent analyses provide clear empirical evidence for the existence of both differential attrition and differential utility.","Leif Brandes, David Godes, Dina Mayzlin","microeconomics, field experiments, electronic commerce, online reviews, online word of mouth",9
Thumbs Up or Down: Consumer Reactions to Decisions by Algorithms Versus Humans,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211070016,10-Mar-22,01-Aug-22,59,4,696,717,"Although companies increasingly are adopting algorithms for consumer-facing tasks (e.g., application evaluations), little research has compared consumers’ reactions to favorable decisions (e.g., acceptances) versus unfavorable decisions (e.g., rejections) about themselves that are made by an algorithm versus a human. Ten studies reveal that, in contrast to managers’ predictions, consumers react less positively when a favorable decision is made by an algorithmic (vs. a human) decision maker, whereas this difference is mitigated for an unfavorable decision. The effect is driven by distinct attribution processes: it is easier for consumers to internalize a favorable decision outcome that is rendered by a human than by an algorithm, but it is easy to externalize an unfavorable decision outcome regardless of the decision maker type. The authors conclude by advising managers on how to limit the likelihood of less positive reactions toward algorithmic (vs. human) acceptances.","Gizem Yalcin, Sarah Lim, Stefano Puntoni,...","algorithms, decision making, decision outcome favorability, attribution theory",19
Variety Effects in Mobile Advertising,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211056090,12-Apr-22,01-Aug-22,59,4,718,738,"Mobile app users are often exposed to a sequence of short-lived marketing interventions (e.g., ads) within each usage session. This study examines how an increase in the variety of ads shown in a session affects a user's response to the next ad. The authors leverage the quasi-experimental variation in ad assignment in their data and propose an empirical framework that accounts for different types of confounding to isolate the effects of a unit increase in variety. Across a series of models, the authors consistently show that an increase in ad variety in a session results in a higher response rate to the next ad: holding all else fixed, a unit increase in variety of the prior sequence of ads can increase the click-through rate on the next ad by approximately 13%. The authors then explore the underlying mechanism and document empirical evidence for an attention-based account. The article offers important managerial implications by identifying a source of interdependence across ad exposures that is often ignored in the design of advertising auctions. Furthermore, the attention-based mechanism suggests that platforms can incorporate real-time attention measures to help advertisers with targeting dynamics.","Omid Rafieian, Hema Yoganarasimhan","mobile advertising, variety, diversity, attention, digitization, sequential decision making",5
The Bulletproof Glass Effect: Unintended Consequences of Privacy Notices,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211069093,18-Feb-22,01-Aug-22,59,4,739,754,"Drawing from a content analysis of publicly traded companies’ privacy notices, a survey of managers, a field study, and five online experiments, this research investigates how consumers respond to privacy notices. A privacy notice, by placing legally enforceable limits on a firm's data practices, communicating safeguards, and signaling transparency, might be expected to promote confidence that personal data will not be misused. Indeed, most managers expected a privacy notice to make customers feel more secure (Study 1). Yet, consistent with the analogy that bulletproof glass can increase feelings of vulnerability despite the protection offered, formal privacy notices undermined consumer trust and decreased purchase interest even when they emphasized objective protection (Studies 2, 3, and 5) or omitted any mention of potentially concerning data practices (Study 6). These unintended consequences did not occur, however, when consumers had an a priori reason to be distrustful (Study 4) or when benevolence cues were added to privacy notices (Studies 5 and 6). Finally, Study 7 showed that both the presence and conspicuous absence of privacy information are sufficient to trigger decreased purchase intent. Together, these results provide actionable guidance to managers on how to effectively convey privacy information (without hurting purchase interest).","Aaron R. Brough, David A. Norton, Shannon L.

Bayesian Consumer Profiling: How to Estimate Consumer Characteristics from Aggregate Data,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211059088,18-Apr-22,01-Aug-22,59,4,755,774,"Firms use aggregate data from data brokers (e.g., Acxiom, Experian) and external data sources (e.g., Census) to infer the likely characteristics of consumers in a target list and thus better predict consumers’ profiles and needs unobtrusively. The authors demonstrate that the simple count method most commonly used in this effort relies implicitly on an assumption of conditional independence that fails to hold in many settings of managerial interest. They develop a Bayesian profiling introducing different conditional independence assumptions. They also show how to introduce additional observed covariates into this model. They use simulations to demonstrate that in managerially relevant settings, the Bayesian method will outperform the simple count method, often by an order of magnitude. The authors then compare different conditional independence assumptions in two case studies. The first example estimates customers’ age on the basis of their first names; prediction errors decrease substantially. In the second example, the authors infer the income, occupation, and education of online visitors of a marketing analytic software company based exclusively on their IP addresses. The face validity of the predictions improves dramatically and reveals an interesting (and more complex) endogenous list-selection mechanism than the one suggested by the simple count method.","Arnaud De Bruyn, Thomas Otter","consumer profiling, data augmentation, data brokerage, Bayesian profiling, sociodemographic profiling, geolocation",1
Default Effects of Credit Card Minimum Payments,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211070589,28-Feb-22,01-Aug-22,59,4,775,796,"Credit card minimum payments are designed to ensure that individuals pay down their debt over time, and scheduling minimum automatic repayments helps people avoid forgetting to repay. Yet minimum payments have additional, unintended psychological default effects by drawing attention away from the card balance due. First, once individuals set the minimum automatic repayment as the default, they then neglect to make the occasional larger repayments they made previously. As a result, individuals incur considerably more credit card interest than late payment fees avoided. Using detailed transaction data, the authors show that approximately 8% of all of the interest ever paid is due to this effect. Second, manual credit card payments are lower when individuals are prompted with minimum payment information. In an experiment, the authors test two new interventions to mitigate this effect—a prompt for full repayment and a prompt asking those repaying little to pay more—yielding large counter effects. Thus, shrouding the minimum payment option for automatic and manual payments and directing attention to the full balance may remedy the unintended effects of default minimum payments.","Hiroaki Sakaguchi, Neil Stewart, John Gathergood,...","default, inattention, automatic repayment, credit card, consumer debt",17
Spotlight Personnel: How Hiring and Turnover Drive Service Performance Versus Demand,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211068049,07-Mar-22,01-Aug-22,59,4,797,820,"In many sectors of the entertainment industry, a few employees attract the public spotlight when performing the core service. For example, in professional team sports, a team of players competes in games, and in TV shows, a cast of artists acts in different episodes. These employees, coined “spotlight personnel,” are an essential but expensive element of ongoing service delivery. Despite their importance and cost, very little is known about how changes in spotlight personnel affect service performance and demand. To address this gap, this article uses unique data on professional German soccer teams, tracking the quantity (number of players) and quality (average transfer price) of spotlight personnel hiring (incoming transfers) and turnover (outgoing transfers), objective service performance (winning percentage), and demand (ticket sales) across four decades, using both traditional and novel time series methods. The results show that service performance and demand are primarily affected by spotlight personnel hiring rather than by turnover. Hiring quantity decreases service performance yet increases demand, whereas hiring quality benefits both service performance and demand. The analysis further uncovers that these effects are subject to dynamic interactions and nonlinearities. Investment scenarios showcase how understanding these effects can substantially improve managerial decision making.","Christine Eckert, Harald J. van Heerde, Hauke A.

Time Periods Feel Longer When They Span More Category Boundaries: Evidence from the Lab and the Field,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211073810,24-Mar-22,01-Aug-22,59,4,821,839,"Seven experiments (total N = 3,509) and a large field data set (N = 1,820,671) demonstrate that time periods of equal duration are not always perceived as equivalent. The authors find that periods feel longer when they span more time categories (e.g., hour, month). For example, periods like 1:45 p.m.–3:15 p.m. and March 31–April 6 (boundary-expanded) feel longer than, say, 1:15 p.m.–2:45 p.m. and April 2–April 8 (boundary-compressed). Reflecting this, participants anticipated completing more work during boundary-expanded periods than during equivalent boundary-compressed periods. This effect appears to result from the salience and placement of time boundaries. Consequently, participants preferred scheduling pleasant activities for boundary-expanded periods and unpleasant activities for boundary-compressed periods. Moreover, participants were willing to pay more to avoid—and required more money to endure—a long wait when that wait was presented as boundary-expanded. Finally, data from more than 1.8 million rideshare trips suggest that consumers are more likely to choose independent rides (e.g., UberX) when they are boundary-compressed when the alternative shared option (e.g., UberPool) is boundary-expanded. Together, our studies reveal that time periods feel longer when they span more boundaries and that this phenomenon shapes consumers’ scheduling and purchasing decisions.","Kristin Donnelly, Giovanni Compiani, Ellen R.K.

High-Energy Ad Content: A Large-Scale Investigation of TV Commercials,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211067802,17-Feb-22,01-Aug-22,59,4,840,859,"A trend reported by both academics and practitioners is that advertising on TV has become increasingly energetic. This study investigates the association between the energy level in ad content and consumers’ ad-tuning tendency. Using a data set of over 27,000 TV commercials delivered to U.S. homes between 2015 and 2018, the authors first present a framework to algorithmically measure the energy level in ad content from the video of ads. This algorithm-based measure is then compared with human-perceived energy levels showing that the measure is related to the level of arousal stimulated by ad content. By relating the energy levels in ad content with the ad-tuning tendency using two empirical procedures, the authors document the following: overall, more energetic commercials are more likely to be tuned in or less likely to be avoided by viewers. The positive association between energy levels in ad content and ad tuning is statistically significant after controlling for placement and other aspects of commercials. However, the association varies across product categories and program genres. The main implication of this study is that advertisers should pay attention to components of ad content other than loudness, which has been regulated by law.","Joonhyuk Yang, Yingkang Xie, Lakshman Krishnamurthi,...","advertising, ad tuning, ad avoidance, multimedia data, audio information retrieval",72
Handling Endogenous Regressors Using Copulas: A Generalization to Linear Panel Models with Fixed Effects and Correlated Regressors,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211070820,07-Apr-22,01-Aug-22,59,4,860,881,"This article proposes a panel data generalization for a recently suggested instrumental variable‐free estimation method that builds on joint estimation. The author shows how the method can be extended to linear panel models by combining fixed-effects transformations with the common generalized least squares transformation to allow for heterogeneous intercepts. To account for between-regressor dependence, the author proposes determining the joint distribution of the error term and all explanatory variables using a Gaussian copula function, with the distinction that some variables are endogenous and the others are exogenous. The identification does not require any instrumental variables if the regressor–error relation is nonlinear. With a normally distributed error, nonnormally distributed endogenous regressors are therefore required. Monte Carlo simulations assess the finite sample performance of the proposed estimator and demonstrate its superiority to conventional instrumental variable estimation. A specific advantage of the proposed method is that the estimator is unbiased in dynamic panel models with small time dimensions and serially correlated errors; therefore, it is a useful alternative to generalized-method-of-moments-style instrumentation. The practical applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated via an empirical example.",Rouven E.

Down a Rabbit Hole: How Prior Media Consumption Shapes Subsequent Media Consumption,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211055403,24-Jan-22,01-Jun-22,59,3,453,471,"Consumers often become “stuck in a rabbit hole” when consuming media. They may watch several YouTube videos in the same category or view several thematically similar artistic images on Instagram in a row, finding it difficult to stop. What causes individuals to choose to consume additional media on a topic that is similar to (vs. different from) what they just experienced? The authors examine a novel antecedent: the consecutive consumption of multiple similar media. After viewing multiple similar media consecutively, more consumers choose to (1) view additional similar media over dissimilar media or (2) complete a dissimilar activity entirely, even when the prior consumption pattern is externally induced. The rabbit hole effect occurs because of increased accessibility of the shared category: when a category is more accessible, people feel immersed in it and anticipate that future options within that category will be more enjoyable. The authors identify three characteristics of media consumption that contribute to the rabbit hole effect by increasing category accessibility: similarity, repetition, and consecutiveness of prior media consumption. This research contributes to literature on technology, choice, and variety seeking, and it offers implications for increasing (vs. slowing) similar consumption.","Kaitlin Woolley*, Marissa A.

Modernizing Retailers in an Emerging Market: Investigating Externally Focused and Internally Focused Approaches,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211058437,18-Feb-22,01-Jun-22,59,3,472,496,"This article studies the impact of business modernization on the sales performance of traditional retailers in an emerging market. The authors define modernization as the adoption of physical structures and tangible practices of organized retail chains (e.g., exterior signage with store name and logo, a database to record product-level information). To address this research question, they implement a randomized field experiment in Mexico City with 1,148 retailers. The sample is randomized as follows: 385 firms are externally modernized in ways that are visible to customers, 383 firms are internally modernized in ways that are not visible to customers, and 380 firms form a control group. The authors find a significant and persistent main effect of modernization on sales. Firms in both treatment groups increase monthly sales by 15%–19% 24 months after study recruitment. In terms of novel mechanism evidence, externally modernized firms improve their store-level branding, while internally modernized firms strengthen their product management. This article also provides an exploratory analysis to guide policy makers, managerial stakeholders, and retailers on how to modernize for the highest returns. This analysis suggests that it is most useful to modernize a firm’s exterior appearance, customer engagement methods, demand analysis, and stock-ordering processes. Finally, the largest improvements come from the initial few modernizing changes, after which returns are diminishing.","Stephen J.

Frequency Versus Intensity: How Thinking of a Frequent Consumption Indulgence as Social Versus Solitary Affects Preferences for How to Cut Back,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211055741,10-Jan-22,01-Jun-22,59,3,497,516,"Many consumers engage in frequent consumption indulgences. Because such indulgences accumulate resource costs (e.g., money, calories), consumers are often prompted to cut back, posing questions for how to design cutback programs with consumer appeal. This research distinguishes between frequent indulgences that consumers think of as social (vs. solitary), demonstrating that thinking of an indulgence as social (vs. solitary) decreases preferences to cut “frequency” (how often the indulgence occasion occurs) and increases preferences to cut “intensity” (choosing a within-category substitute that involves lower resource expenditure). The author explains these effects by differentiating between enjoyment from the product itself and enjoyment from aspects outside the product. Thinking of an indulgence as social (vs. solitary) heightens people’s anticipated enjoyment, particularly for aspects outside of the product, decreasing interest in cutting the number of occasions (cutting frequency) and increasing interest in cutting back on the product itself via a within-category substitute (cutting intensity). This divergence in cutback preferences for social (vs. solitary) experiences is thus eliminated (1) when consumers think of social experiences with distant (vs. close) others, which involve lower enjoyment outside of the product, or (2) when solitary experiences primarily involve heightened enjoyment for aspects outside of the product.",Peggy J.

Prominent Retailer and Intrabrand Competition,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211044105,15-Nov-21,01-Jun-22,59,3,517,533,"Online retail search traffic is often concentrated at a “prominent” retailer for a product. The authors unpack the ramifications of this pattern on pricing, profit, and consumer welfare in an intrabrand setting. Prominence denotes a larger number of heterogenous-search-cost consumers starting their search at the prominent retailer than at any other retailer. These analyses show that search traffic concentration can intensify intrabrand competition, lower average prices of all retailers, and improve consumer welfare. Interestingly, the prominent retailer's incremental traffic advantage can increase or reduce its own profit; the authors denote these as the “blessing” and “curse” of prominence, respectively. The authors extend their analysis to a setting where consumers consider searching only among those retailers they are individually aware of; the prominent retailer is included in all these individual awareness sets. The effects on market average prices and welfare carry over, but only below a critical threshold level of the prominent retailer's first-search traffic advantage. Above this threshold, market average prices rise and welfare decreases, making this the region where search concentration warrants scrutiny from policy makers. The authors close with policy remedies and managerial implications of search concentration.","Ruitong Wang, Yi Zhu, George John","competitive strategy, curse of prominence, digital markets, intrabrand competition, ordered search, search cost heterogeneity, search traffic concentration",2
Deceptive Claims Using Fake News Advertising: The Impact on Consumers,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211039804,10-Nov-21,01-Jun-22,59,3,534,554,"Fake news advertising—advertising that mimics legitimate news articles—can be harmful if it misleads consumers to take actions they otherwise would not have taken (e.g., purchase an inferior product). However, little is known about whether fake news ads bring in new customers or are merely viewed by people already in the market for the advertised products. The author exploits a Federal Trade Commission–enabled shutdown of fake news advertisements for various products such as acai cleanses and teeth whiteners (but where the product sites continued to remain operational) to identify the extent of consumer interest in the presence and absence of fake news advertising. The findings indicate that interest wanes after the shutdown of fake news advertising, with the probability of a product site not receiving any new visits increasing by 22%. The overall decline in visits caused by the absence of fake news ads occurs despite some substitution by consumers to regular advertisements.",Anita Rao,"natural experiments, public policy, legal, advertising, history, events, and cases",1
How Does Global–Local Identity Affect Consumer Preference for Access-Based Consumption? Investigating the Mediating Role of Consumption Openness,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211055130,10-Jan-22,01-Jun-22,59,3,555,577,"Given the increasing importance of the global sharing economy, consumers face the decision of whether to choose an access-based option versus an owned option. However, understanding of how consumers’ global–local identity may influence their preference for access-based consumption is rather limited. The authors fill this knowledge gap by proposing that consumers high in global identity (“globals”) have a greater preference for access-based consumption than those high in local identity (“locals”). Such effects are mediated by consumers’ consumption openness. Consistent with the “consumption openness” account, the authors find that when the desire for openness is enhanced by a contextual cue, locals’ preference for access-based consumption is elevated, whereas globals’ preference for access-based consumption is unaffected. However, when the desire for openness is suppressed by a contextual cue, globals’ preference for access-based consumption is reduced, whereas locals’ preference for access-based consumption is unaffected. Similarly, consumers’ traveler–settler orientation sets a boundary for the relationship between global–local identity and preference for access-based consumption, given its close association with consumption openness. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.","Xiaodong Nie, Zhiyong Yang, Yinlong Zhang,...","sharing economy, preference for access-based consumption, global–local identity, consumption openness, traveler–settler orientation",0
Perceived Versus Negotiated Discounts: The Role of Advertised Reference Prices in Price Negotiations,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211034443,14-Oct-21,01-Jun-22,59,3,578,599,"Retailers routinely present a posted or sale price together with a higher advertised reference price, in an effort to evoke a perception of the discount the consumer is receiving. However, if prices can be negotiated, what impact does this initial perceived discount (IPD) have on the ultimate discount, demand, and revenue? With data from consumers of a large durable goods retailer, in a natural decision-making environment, this study provides evidence that a greater IPD is associated with smaller negotiated discounts. Then, a lab experiment involving negotiation and purchase decisions for multiple products, with randomly assigned values of the IPD, establishes that a $1 increase in IPD lowers the negotiated discount by 5.7 cents. Furthermore, 55% of this decrease can be attributed to reduction in the participants’ likelihood to initiate a negotiation. Under bargaining, almost one-third of the increase in revenue from a higher IPD stems from an increase in the negotiated price, which is unlike fixed pricing, in which setting an increase in IPD affects revenue only through changes in demand. Finally, the optimal advertised reference prices a seller would post under bargaining and fixed pricing are similar, but the benefit from posting this price is significantly higher under bargaining. These findings in turn have implications for researchers, retailers, consumers and policy makers.",Pranav Jindal,"price negotiations, bargaining, advertised reference prices, initial perceived discount, anchoring, behavioral economics, comparative price advertising",1
Attribute Sentiment Scoring with Online Text Reviews: Accounting for Language Structure and Missing Attributes,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211052500,04-Jan-22,01-Jun-22,59,3,600,622,"The authors address two significant challenges in using online text reviews to obtain fine-grained, attribute-level sentiment ratings. First, in contrast to methods that rely on word frequency, they develop a deep learning convolutional–long short-term memory hybrid model to account for language structure. The convolutional layer accounts for spatial structure (adjacent word groups or phrases), and long short-term memory accounts for the sequential structure of language (sentiment distributed and modified across nonadjacent phrases). Second, they address the problem of missing attributes in text when constructing attribute sentiment scores, as reviewers write about only a subset of attributes and remain silent on others. They develop a model-based imputation strategy using a structural model of heterogeneous rating behavior. Using Yelp restaurant review data, they show superior attribute sentiment scoring accuracy with their model. They identify three reviewer segments with different motivations: status seeking, altruism/want voice, and need to vent/praise. Surprisingly, attribute mentions in reviews are driven by the need to inform and vent/praise rather than by attribute importance. The heterogeneous model-based imputation performs better than other common imputations and, importantly, leads to managerially significant corrections in restaurant attribute ratings. More broadly, the results suggest that social science research should pay more attention to reducing measurement error in variables constructed from text.","Ishita Chakraborty, Minkyung Kim, K.

The Impact of Historical Price Information on Purchase Deferral,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211060359,24-Jan-22,01-Jun-22,59,3,623,640,"In this article, the authors examine how historical price information influences consumers’ decision to defer a purchase. They focus on two aspects of historical price information: the direction and the frequency of past price changes. The authors advance a theoretical framework postulating that the interaction between these two factors shapes consumers’ decisions to buy now versus later. Controlling for the total magnitude of price changes, the authors propose that consumers are more likely to defer purchase when the price of the product has previously increased compared with when the price has decreased. Importantly, the authors hypothesize that this effect is more pronounced when consumers observe a single large change in price (e.g., a decrease of $100 vs. an increase of $100) compared with when they observe multiple smaller changes that establish a trend (e.g., four decreases of $25 vs. four increases of $25). The authors argue that these effects are driven by differences in consumers’ expectations about future prices. They test their predictions, as well as two moderators of the proposed effects—the monotonicity and the timing of price changes—in six well-powered preregistered experimental studies (N = 5,713) using both hypothetical and actual purchases.","Manissa P.

A Reference-Dependent-Preferences-Based Model of Extended Warranty Purchase Decisions,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211056911,25-Mar-22,01-Jun-22,59,3,641,658,"Durable goods often come bundled with limited-time and sometimes generous factory/base warranties. Yet, for many durable goods, customers purchase extended warranties against which they rarely make claims. This study offers a reference-dependent-preferences-based theoretical explanation for why consumers purchase extended warranties even if their purchased good is already covered by a base warranty. The authors show that consumers treat base warranties as a reference point, thereby creating a qualitative difference in the valuation of an extended warranty on the purchased product. The proposed theory model is validated using observational data from the automobile industry and shows how the reference-dependent-preferences-based effect varies with vehicle quality and macroeconomic conditions. The analyses reveal auto buyers’ elevated loss-aversion motivations and higher price sensitivity during weaker macroeconomic conditions than during more robust macroeconomic conditions. Finally, the authors use the empirical model to identify opportunities for auto dealers to engage in targeted price promotions as a function of prevailing macroeconomic conditions. These findings have important implications for marketing managers, as they provide valuable guidance on when an extended warranty should be promoted, to whom it should be promoted, and which extended warranty should be marketed.","Hyeong-Tak Lee, Sriram Venkataraman","warranty, reference-dependent preferences, loss aversion, automobile industry",1

"Cross-National Differences in Market Response: Line-Length, Price, and Distribution Elasticities in 14 Indo-Pacific Rim Economies",https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211058102,21-Feb-22,01-Apr-22,59,2,251,270,"The field's knowledge of marketing-mix elasticities is largely restricted to developed countries in the North-Atlantic region, even though other parts of the world—especially the Indo-Pacific Rim region—have become economic powerhouses. To better allocate marketing budgets, firms need to have information about marketing-mix elasticities for countries outside the North-Atlantic region. The authors use data covering over 1,600 brands from 14 product categories collected in 7 developed and 7 emerging Indo-Pacific Rim countries across more than 10 years to estimate marketing elasticities for line length, price, and distribution and examine which brand, category, and country factors influence these elasticities.

Contrary to what has been suggested in previous research, the authors find no systematic differences in marketing responsiveness between emerging and developed economies. Instead, the key country-level factor driving elasticities is societal stratification, with Hofstede's measure of power inequality (power distance) as its cultural manifestation and income inequality as its economic manifestation.

"We Succeeded Together, Now What: Relationship Power and Sequential Decisions in Couples’ Joint Goal Pursuits",https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211034513,06-Oct-21,01-Apr-22,59,2,271,289,"Research has demonstrated that after making high goal progress, consumers feel liberated to engage in goal-inconsistent behaviors. But what happens after consumers make high progress in the context of joint goal pursuit? The authors examine how jointly made progress toward a joint goal pursued by couples affects subsequent individually made goal-relevant decisions. Across five experiments with both lab-created couples and married participants and financial data from a couples’ money management mobile app, the authors show that after making high progress on a joint goal (vs. low or no progress), partners with higher relationship power are more likely to disengage from the joint goal to pursue personal concerns (e.g., indulge themselves, pursue individual goals), whereas partners with lower relationship power do not disengage from the joint goal and continue engaging in goal-consistent actions that maintain its pursuit. The authors elucidate the underlying mechanism, providing evidence that the joint goal progress boosts the relational self-concept of high- (but not low-) relationship-power partners, and this drives the effects. Importantly, they demonstrate the effectiveness of two theory-grounded and easily implementable interventions that promote goal-consistent behaviors among high-relationship-power consumers in the context of joint savings goals.","Hristina Nikolova, Gergana Y.

Information Disclosure Policy and Its Implications: Ratcheting in Supply Chains,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211035115,06-Dec-21,01-Apr-22,59,2,290,305,"Fear of escalating input prices in response to retail success is a commonly discussed phenomenon affecting supply chains. Such a ratchet effect arises when a retailer feels compelled to modify its investments to better serve the end customers in order to hide positive prospects and restrain future wholesale price hikes. In a two-period model of supply chain interactions, the authors demonstrate that such an endogenous ratchet effect can have multifaceted reverberations. A retailer fearing price hikes may be tempted to curtail near-term profits to ensure favorable long-term pricing. In response, the supplier can use deep discounts in its initial wholesale prices to convince the retailer to focus on its short-term profits rather than long-term pricing concerns. These deep discounts not only encourage mutually beneficial investments but also alleviate double marginalization inefficiencies along the supply chain. In light of these results, the authors show that a mandatory information disclosure policy to reduce the ratchet effect decreases total channel efficiency compared with no information disclosure, precisely because mandatory disclosure interrupts the healthy tension among supply chain partners. Thus, the model presents a scenario in which ratcheting concerns can create a degree of self-enforcing cooperation that results in socially beneficial responses in supply chains.","Brian Mittendorf, Jiwoong Shin, Dae-Hee Yoon","ratcheting, information disclosure, supply chains, pricing",1
Observing Product Touch: The Vicarious Haptic Effect in Digital Marketing and Virtual Reality,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211059540,15-Feb-22,01-Apr-22,59,2,306,326,"Retail is rapidly evolving to construct virtual environments for consumers. Online product images, videos, and virtual reality (VR) interfaces enliven consumer experiences and are a source of product information. Because consumers are unable to physically touch products in these digital environments, this research examines vicarious touch, or the observation of a hand in physical contact with a product in a digital environment. Across eight studies, the authors use images, GIFs, and VR to show that vicarious touch affects consumers’ psychological ownership and product valuation due to the active nature of product touch, which results in a felt sense of body ownership of the virtual hand. This is termed the “vicarious haptic effect.” Results demonstrate that it is not enough to show a hand in an advertisement; the hand must be touching a product. The vicarious haptic effect is strongest for people who become highly stimulated by an immersive VR experience (i.e., measured via the elevation in heart rate). The vicarious haptic effect is attenuated if the viewed interaction does not represent a diagnostic hand movement. The authors discuss theoretical and managerial implications for digital product presentation to encourage feelings of product ownership and valuation.","Andrea Webb Luangrath, Joann Peck, William Hedgcock,...","online retail, touch, haptics, vicarious experience, psychological ownership, body ownership, virtual reality, heart rate",219

Dr. Oz, a celebrity physician, often makes medical recommendations with limited or marginal scientific evidence. Although reputable news agencies have traditionally acted as gatekeepers of reliable information, they face the intense pressure of “the eyeball game.” Customer reviews, despite their authenticity, may come from deceived consumers. Therefore, it remains unclear whether public information sources can correct the misleading health information. In the context of over-the-counter weight loss products, the authors carefully analyze the cascading of information post endorsement. The analysis of extensive textual content with deep-learning methods reveals that legitimate news outlets respond to Dr. Oz's endorsement by generating more news articles about the ingredient; on average, articles after the endorsement contain higher sentiment, so news agencies seem to amplify rather than rectify the misleading endorsement. The finding highlights a serious concern: the risk of hype news diffusion. Research articles react too slowly to mitigate the problem, and online customer reviews and product discussions provide only marginal corrections. The findings underscore the importance of oversight to mitigate the risk of cascading hype news.","Zijun (June) Shi, Xiao Liu, Kannan Srinivasan","hype news, Oz Effect, health care, misinformation, natural language processing",43
Preference Reversals Between Digital and Physical Goods,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211065020,21-Mar-22,01-Apr-22,59,2,353,373,"The proliferation of digital goods has led to an increased interest in how the digitization of products and services affects consumer behavior. In this article, the authors show that although consumers are willing to pay more for physical than digital goods, this difference attenuates—and even reverses—when consumers are asked to make a choice between the two product formats. This effect is explained by a contingent weighting principle: In willingness to pay, a quantitative task, consumers anchor on quantitative information (e.g., market beliefs). However, in choice, a qualitative task, consumers anchor on qualitative information (e.g., which good dominates on the most important attribute). These differences in contingent weighting result in physical goods being preferred in willingness to pay, but their digital equivalent being preferred relatively more in choice. The authors draw conclusions from ten preregistered experiments and six supplemental studies using a variety of goods in hypothetical and incentive-compatible contexts, as well as within- and between-subjects designs. The article concludes with a discussion of implications for the marketing of digital goods.","Rhia Catapano, Fuad Shennib, Jonathan Levav","digital goods, preference reversals, compatibility, digitization, preference elicitation",3
Demand Interactions in Sharing Economies: Evidence from a Natural Experiment Involving Airbnb and Uber/Lyft,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211062172,18-Feb-22,01-Apr-22,59,2,374,391,"The authors examine whether and how ride-sharing services influence the demand for home-sharing services. Their identification strategy hinges on a natural experiment in which Uber/Lyft exited Austin, Texas, in May 2016 due to local regulation. Using a 12-month longitudinal data set of 11,536 Airbnb properties, they find that Uber/Lyft's exit led to a 14% decrease in Airbnb occupancy in Austin. In response, hosts decreased the nightly rate by $9.30 and the supply by 4.5%. The authors argue that when Uber/Lyft exited Austin, the transportation costs for most Airbnb guests increased significantly because most Airbnb properties (unlike hotels) have poor access to public transportation. The authors report three key findings: First, demand became less geographically dispersed, falling (increasing) for Airbnb properties with poor (excellent) access to public transportation. Second, demand decreased significantly for low-end properties, whose guests may be more price sensitive, but not for high-end properties. Third, the occupancy of Austin hotels increased after Uber/Lyft's exit; the increase occurred primarily among low-end hotels, which can substitute for low-end Airbnb properties. The results indicate that access to affordable, convenient transportation is critical for the success of home-sharing services in residential areas. Regulations that negatively affect ride-sharing services may also negatively affect the demand for home-sharing services.","Shunyuan Zhang, Dokyun Lee, Param Singh,...","Airbnb, Uber, natural experiment, geographic demand dispersion, demand interactions in sharing economy",1
Tainted by Stigma: The Interplay of Stigma and Moral Identity in Health Persuasion,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211060854,23-Feb-22,01-Apr-22,59,2,392,410,"The current research examines the interactive effect of consumers’ moral identity and risk factor stigma on health message effectiveness. The authors theorize that engaging in advocated health behaviors has moral associations; however, a stigmatized risk factor in a message “taints” the morality of the advocated health behavior. Thus, consumers with high (vs. low) moral identity are more likely to comply with health messages when risk factor stigma is low, and this positive moral identity effect is undermined when risk factor stigma is high. The authors test stigma's threat to moral identity by measuring defensive processing (Studies 1 and 2) and the attenuating effect of self-affirmation on the negative effect of stigma (Studies 3 and 4). They apply the stigma-by-association principle to develop and test a messaging intervention (Study 5). The studies suggest that, depending on whether a health message contains stigmatized risk factors, marketers could employ a combination of tactics such as activating moral identity, offering self-affirming message frames, and/or highlighting low-stigma risk factors to bolster message effectiveness.","Chethana Achar, Lea H.

The 2012 privatization of off-premises liquor sales in Washington State created a unique opportunity to observe retailers learning to set prices from the beginning of the learning process. Tracking this market as it evolved through time, the authors find that firms indeed learn to set more profitable prices, that these prices increasingly reflect demand fundamentals, and that prices ultimately converge to levels consistent with (static) profit maximization. The authors further demonstrate that initial pricing mistakes are largest for products whose demand conditions differ the most from those of previously privatized markets, that retailers with previous experience in the category are initially better informed, and that learning is faster for products with more precise sales information. These findings indicate that firm behavior converges to rational models of firm conduct, but such convergence takes time to unfold and plays out differently for different firms. These patterns suggest the important roles of firms’ learning and heterogeneous firm capabilities.","Yufeng Huang, Paul B. Ellickson, Mitchell J.

Accordingly, the authors also propose that prompting consumers to consider reasons why their expenses might be different than usual increases predictions—and therefore prediction accuracy—by bringing atypical expenses to mind.

Although retention and completion rates for nonpaying users have not been promising, these statistics are much brighter for users who pay to receive a certificate upon completing the course. We investigate whether paying for the certificate option can increase engagement with course content. In particular, we consider two effects: (1) the certificate effect, which is the boost in motivation to stay engaged to receive the certificate; and (2) the sunk-cost effect, which arises solely because the user paid for the course. We use data from over 70 courses offered on the Coursera platform and study the engagement of individual participants at different milestones within each course. The panel nature of the data enables us to include controls for intrinsic differences between nonpaying and paying users in terms of their desire to stay engaged. We find evidence that the certificate and sunk-cost effects increase user engagement by approximately 8%–9% and 17%–20%, respectively. Whereas the sunk-cost effect is transient and lasts for only a few weeks after payment, the certificate effect lasts until the participant reaches the grade required to be eligible to receive the certificate. We discuss the implications of our findings for how platforms and content creators may design course milestones and schedule payment of course fees. Given that greater engagement tends to improve learning outcomes, our study serves as an important first step in understanding the role of prices and payment in enabling MOOCs to realize their full potential.","Ali Goli, Pradeep K.

By modeling the heterogeneity across learners pursuing lecture and quiz completion goals, the authors capture different patterns of consumption that correspond to extant theories of goal progress within an empirical field setting. They find that most individuals exhibit a learning style whereby lecture utility changes as an inverted U-shaped function of current progress. This model may also be used as an early detection system to anticipate changes in engagement, and it enables the authors to relate learning styles to final performance outcomes and enrollment in additional courses. Finally, the authors examine how quiz-taking varies across learners in different courses and between those who have paid versus not paid for the option to earn a course certificate.","Joy Lu, Eric T.

The “Idea Advantage”: How Content Sharing Strategies Impact Engagement in Online Learning Platforms,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211017828,30-Sep-21,01-Feb-22,59,1,61,78,"In recent years, online learning platforms (e.g., Coursera, edX) have experienced massive growth and have reached nearly 200 million learners. Although their reach is quite large, the impact of these platforms is constrained by a low level of learner engagement. In traditional face-to-face classrooms, educators aim to engage learners by asking them to participate in class discussions and share information about their identity and ideas. However, the effectiveness of these strategies in online learning platforms is uncertain. The authors examine this issue by assessing the impact of two different types of content sharing on learner engagement. The authors conduct a textual analysis of over 12,000 text postings during an 18-month period (Study 1) and a field experiment among over 2,000 learners (Study 2) in a popular Coursera offering by a large U.S. university. The results indicate that asking learners to share ideas (vs. their identity) has a stronger effect on their video consumption and assessment completion. The authors explain this “idea advantage” by suggesting that learners who share ideas (vs. identity) exhibit a greater degree of elaboration. This idea advantage is strongest for learners from English-speaking countries and those new to online learning.","Unnati Narang, Manjit S.

Home-Tutoring Services Assisted with Technology: Investigating the Role of Artificial Intelligence Using a Randomized Field Experiment,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211050351,08-Dec-21,01-Feb-22,59,1,79,96,"Despite a rising interest in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, research in services marketing has not evaluated its role in helping firms learn about customers’ needs and increasing the adaptability of service employees.

The randomized controlled trial in the context of tutoring services shows that helping service employees (tutors) adapt to students’ learning needs by providing AI-generated diagnoses significantly improves service outcomes measured by academic performance. However, the authors find that some tutors may not utilize AI assistance (i.e., AI aversion), and factors associated with unforeseen barriers to usage (i.e., technology overload) can moderate its impact on outcomes. Interestingly, tutors who significantly contribute to the firm's revenue relied heavily on AI assistance but unexpectedly benefited little from AI in improving service outcomes.

Collating novel panel data from DonorsChoose and California Department of Education, the authors show that (1) crowdfunded resources positively affect student academic achievement, (2) student academic achievement improves with the increase in the heterogeneity of intellectual needs that crowdfunded resources likely satisfy, (3) crowd screening of project proposals plays a critical role in the offline effectiveness of crowdfunded resources, and (4) crowd screening effectiveness depends on the type of project.","Chen Zhou, Manpreet Gill, Qiang Liu","crowd screening, service employee empowerment, crowdfunding offline outcomes, K–12 education, education crowdfunding",1

How can established organizations adapt to marketization? To answer this question, the authors study the adaptation of five established religious schools to the marketization of education in Brazil. They develop the novel hybridization strategy of nested coupling and explain that established organizations respond to marketization by balancing competing demands for differentiation and conformity. The authors show how religious schools nest the market logic within the religious logic by reconfiguring their resources to conform to market demands while differentiating themselves through their religious orientation. Nested coupling provides a novel strategic approach for established organizations in marketized or marketizing fields, such as hospitals, museums, and schools, to capitalize on a logic that preexists marketization and to create a unique competitive positioning in the market.","Pierre-Yann Dolbec, Rodrigo B.

Even with student loans, however, the authors find that students psychologically realize the financial costs of a college education long before their loan repayments begin. This early cost realization frames financial decisions between most pairs of colleges as an intertemporal trade-off. Students choose between investments with (1) smaller short-term costs but smaller long-term returns (a lower-cost, lower-return [LC-LR] college) and (2) larger short-term costs but larger long-term returns (a higher-cost, higher-return [HC-HR] college). The authors find that early cost realization increases preferences for LC-LR colleges—preferences that could reduce lifetime earnings—in both simulations and experiments. Preferences for LC-LR colleges are pronounced among financially impatient students and in choice pairs of LC-LR and HC-HR colleges where the equilibrium is set at a low-discount-rate threshold. A return-on-investment strategy, future uncertainty, and debt aversion cannot explain these results.

Drawing on data from over 11,000 participants across ten experiments, the authors offer evidence that when news is repeatedly retold, it undergoes a stylistic transformation termed “disagreeable personalization,” wherein original facts are increasingly supplanted by opinions and interpretations with a slant toward negativity. The central thesis is that when retellers believe they are more (vs. less) knowledgeable than their recipient about the information they are relaying, they feel more compelled to provide guidance on its meaning and to do so in a persuasive manner. This enhanced motivation to guide persuasively, in turn, leads retellers to not only select the subset of facts they deem most essential but, critically, to provide their interpretations and opinions on those facts, with negativity being used as a means of grabbing their audience’s attention. Implications of this work for research on retelling and consumer information diffusion are explored.","Shiri Melumad, Robert Meyer, Yoon Duk Kim","information diffusion, natural language processing, retelling, social media, word of mouth",64
Consumer Behavior in the Online Classroom: Using Video Analytics and Machine Learning to Understand the Consumption of Video Courseware,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211042013,15-Nov-21,01-Dec-21,58,6,1079,1100,"Video is one of the fastest growing online services offered to consumers. The rapid growth of online video consumption brings new opportunities for marketing executives and researchers to analyze consumer behavior. However, video also introduces new challenges. Specifically, analyzing unstructured video data presents formidable methodological challenges that limit the use of multimedia data to generate marketing insights. To address this challenge, the authors propose a novel video feature framework based on machine learning and computer vision techniques, which helps marketers predict and understand the consumption of online video from a content-based perspective. The authors apply this framework to two unique data sets: one provided by MasterClass, consisting of 771 online videos and more than 2.6 million viewing records from 225,580 consumers, and another from Crash Course, consisting of 1,127 videos focusing on more traditional education disciplines. The analyses show that the framework proposed in this article can be used to accurately predict both individual-level consumer behavior and aggregate video popularity in these two very different contexts. The authors discuss how their findings and methods can be used to advance management and marketing research with unstructured video data in other contexts such as video marketing and entertainment analytics.","Mi Zhou, George H.

Construal Matching in Online Search: Applying Text Analysis to Illuminate the Consumer Decision Journey,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720940693,02-Sep-20,01-Dec-21,58,6,1101,1119,"As consumers move through their decision journey, they adopt different goals (e.g., transactional vs. informational). In this research, the authors propose that consumer goals can be detected through textual analysis of online search queries and that both marketers and consumers can benefit when paid search results and advertisements match consumer search–related goals. In bridging construal level theory and textual analysis, the authors show that consumers at different stages of the decision journey tend to assume different levels of mental construal, or mindsets (i.e., abstract vs. concrete). They find evidence of a fluency-driven matching effect in online search such that when consumer mindsets are more abstract (more concrete), consumers generate textual search queries that use more abstract (more concrete) language. Furthermore, they are more likely to click on search engine results and ad content that matches their mindset, thereby experiencing more search satisfaction and perceiving greater goal progress. Six empirical studies, including a pilot study, a survey, three lab experiments, and a field experiment involving over 128,000 ad impressions provide support for this construal matching effect in online search.","Ashlee Humphreys, Mathew S.

Understanding Lateral and Vertical Biases in Consumer Attention: An In-Store Ambulatory Eye-Tracking Study,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243721998375,12-May-21,01-Dec-21,58,6,1120,1141,"Using in-store ambulatory eye-tracking, the authors investigate the extent to which lateral and vertical biases drive consumers’ attention in a grocery store environment. The data set offers a complete picture of both where the shopper is located and the shopper’s field of view and visual fixations during the trip. The authors address two research questions: First, do shoppers have a higher propensity to pay attention to products on their left or right side as they traverse an aisle (i.e., is the right side the “right” side)? Second, do shoppers tend to pay more attention to products at their eye level (i.e., is eye level “buy level”)? The authors utilize the exogenous variations in the direction by which shoppers traverse an aisle to identify lateral bias. The exogenous variation of shoppers’ eye-level positions is used to identify vertical bias. The authors find that shoppers pay more attention to products on their right side when traversing an aisle. Contrary to many practitioners’ belief, eye level is not “buy level”; rather, the product level that has the greatest propensity to capture shoppers’ attention is approximately 14.7 inches below eye level (which is around chest level).","Ming Chen, Raymond R.

A Poisson Factorization Topic Model for the Study of Creative Documents (and Their Summaries),https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720943209,22-Sep-20,01-Dec-21,58,6,1142,1158,"The author proposes a topic model tailored to the study of creative documents (e.g., academic papers, movie scripts), which extends Poisson factorization in two ways. First, the creativity literature emphasizes the importance of novelty in creative industries. Accordingly, this article introduces a set of residual topics that represent the portion of each document that is not explained by a combination of common topics. Second, creative documents are typically accompanied by summaries (e.g., abstracts, synopses). Accordingly, the author jointly models the content of creative documents and their summaries, and captures systematic variations in topic intensities between the documents and their summaries. This article validates and illustrates the model in three domains: marketing academic papers, movie scripts, and TV show closed captions. It illustrates how the joint modeling of documents and summaries provides some insight into how people summarize creative documents and enhances understanding of the significance of each topic. It shows that the model described produces new measures of distinctiveness that can inform the perennial debate on the relation between novelty and success in creative industries.

This research classifies social media brand imagery and studies user response. Aside from packshots (standalone product images), two types of brand-related selfie images appear online: consumer selfies (featuring brands and consumers’ faces) and an emerging phenomenon the authors term “brand selfies” (invisible consumers holding a branded product). The authors use convolutional neural networks to identify these archetypes and train language models to infer social media response to more than a quarter-million brand-image posts (185 brands on Twitter and Instagram). They find that consumer-selfie images receive more sender engagement (i.e., likes and comments), whereas brand selfies result in more brand engagement, expressed by purchase intentions. These results cast doubt on whether conventional social media metrics are appropriate indicators of brand engagement. Results for display ads are consistent with this observation, with higher click-through rates for brand selfies than for consumer selfies. A controlled lab experiment suggests that self-reference is driving the differential response to selfie images. Collectively, these results demonstrate how (interpretable) machine learning helps extract marketing-relevant information from unstructured multimedia content and that selfie images are a matter of perspective in terms of actual brand engagement.","Jochen Hartmann, Mark Heitmann, Christina Schamp,...","user-generated content, social media, image analysis, deep learning, natural language processing, interpretable machine learning",13

Exploring this relationship further, in Studies 2, 3, and 4, the author finds that brands can leverage this association, reducing emotionality in brand communications to increase perceived brand status. This strategy is effective because reduced emotionality is associated with high-status communication norms, which evoke high-status reference groups.

Relative Effectiveness of Print and Digital Advertising: A Memory Perspective,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211034438,06-Sep-21,01-Oct-21,58,5,827,844,"The exponential growth in digital media has recently challenged the value of print media in the overall marketing mix. Across three studies, the authors evaluate the relative effectiveness of print ads versus digital ads. In Study 1, using eye tracking and biometric measures during exposure, the authors find stronger encoding and engagement for print ads over digital ads. A week later, participants showed no significant difference in recognizing ads across format, though they better remembered the encoding context of print ads. Notably, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the authors find greater activation in hippocampus and parahippocampal regions for print ads relative to digital ads. Extending these insights, Study 2 demonstrates that participants better remember print ads across contents, context, and brand associations when using snippets as retrieval cues. In addition to establishing the robustness of previous findings, Study 3 provides further evidence that the observed memory advantage for print ads is primarily due to superior encoding during initial exposure. From a practical perspective, these findings suggest that marketers should not discount the value of print media in advertising, despite the rapid growth of digital media and communications.","Vinod Venkatraman, Angelika Dimoka, Khoi Vo,...","print media, digital media, memory recall, memory recognition, functional magnetic resonance imaging",12
The Minimum Wage and Consumer Nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211023475,06-Sep-21,01-Oct-21,58,5,845,869,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that one in nine U.S. households is “food insecure”: unable to purchase sufficient, or healthy food. Public policy advocates and politicians have pointed to the prevailing federal minimum wage as a culprit, labeling it a “starvation wage.” This study examines whether and to what extent increases to the minimum wage have improved the quantity and nutritional quality of food purchased by minimum wage earners, and what implications these potential changes in consumer behavior have for marketers. The authors show that households likely to be earning the minimum wage increase their calories purchased in response to minimum wage increases, and that these gains are predominantly found among households purchasing the least amount of food prior to the minimum wage rising. Although the authors do not find evidence that the average household improves the nutritional content of calories purchased, they do find evidence that the least healthy households (as measured by past purchases) buy more healthy foods in response to rising minimum wages. Overall, the findings suggest that higher minimum wages may not only help households afford more calories but also encourage some households to purchase more healthy calories. In addition, the authors find an increased openness among minimum wage households to purchasing new grocery items. This openness to trying previously unpurchased products offers promotion and product line planning opportunities to manufacturers. It also offers retailers with a nutrition-friendly brand image an opportunity to nudge consumers toward purchasing more healthy foods.","Mike Palazzolo, Adithya Pattabhiramaiah","food insecurity, marketing and public policy, minimum wage, nutritional inequality, nutrition and nudges",31
How Association with Physical Waste Attenuates Consumer Preferences for Rescue-Based Food,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211031243,08-Sep-21,01-Oct-21,58,5,870,887,"In an effort to combat food waste, many firms have introduced rescue-based foods (RBFs), which are made from ingredients that are safe to eat but would otherwise be wasted, often due to aesthetic issues or oversupply. Although the benefits of RBF are varied, some firms adopt strategies that highlight RBF’s waste-reduction benefits, such as reduced landfill use or lower environmental impact. This research posits that when firms adopt strategies that highlight associations between physical waste and RBF, those associations can generate negative mental imagery, which can trigger disgust and mitigate positive consumer attitudes toward RBF. When such associations are not present, demand is consistent with demand for conventional foods. The authors find support for the role of mental imagery in this demand mitigation process, with some promotional appeals stimulating thoughts of physical waste. Counterintuitively, this research reveals that when marketers adopt the common practice of using environmental benefit appeals that can trigger physical waste associations, such as the color green, consumer demand for RBF diminishes. Conversely, focusing on the societal benefits or limiting the number of cues available to create physical waste associations generates consumer demand for these foods on a level equivalent to that of conventional food.","Anna de Visser-Amundson, John Peloza, Mirella Kleijnen","corporate social responsibility, food waste, mental imagery, rescue-based food, sustainability",2
First-Price Auctions in Online Display Advertising,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211030201,06-Oct-21,01-Oct-21,58,5,888,907,"The authors link the rapid and dramatic move from second-price to first-price auction format in the display advertising market, on the one hand, to the move from the waterfalling mechanism employed by publishers for soliciting bids in a preordered cascade over exchanges to an alternate header bidding strategy that broadcasts the request for bid to all exchanges simultaneously, on the other. First, they argue that the move from waterfalling to header bidding was a revenue-improving move for publishers in the old regime when exchanges employed second-price auctions. Given the publisher move to header bidding, the authors show that exchanges move from second-price to first-price auctions to increase their expected clearing prices. Interestingly, when all exchanges move to first-price auctions, each exchange faces stronger competition from other exchanges, and some exchanges may end up with lower revenue than when all exchanges use second-price auctions; yet all exchanges move to first-price auctions in the unique equilibrium of the game. The authors show that the new regime hinders the exchanges’ ability to differentiate in equilibrium. Furthermore, it allows the publishers to achieve the revenue of the optimal mechanism despite not having direct access to the advertisers.","Stylianos Despotakis, R.

The authors examine whether a boost in consumers’ self-perceived attractiveness influences subsequent choices in domains unrelated to beauty. Across six studies, the authors find converging evidence that a boost in consumers’ self-perceived attractiveness enhances their general self-confidence and reduces preference uncertainty, resulting in less reliance on the choice context and thus fewer choices of compromise, all-average, and default options. The findings further show that consumers use self-confidence as metacognitive information for inferring preference uncertainty in subsequent decisions. This process is a misattribution that can be attenuated when consumers attribute their self-confidence to the self-perceived attractiveness.

The latter have been consistently growing their footprints since. This study documents the role of television advertising to explain satellite operators’ success. Using data on U.S. households’ subscription choices and operators’ advertising decisions, the authors document both demand- and supply-side conditions conducive to the growth of the satellite operators. First, the authors find that consumers in this market were sensitive to advertising, and especially so to that of the satellite operators (ad elasticities of about .05–.06 for satellite operators vs. .02 for cable operators). The authors employ a border strategy to demonstrate advertising-elastic demand and discuss its robustness to potential threats to identification. Second, the authors provide suggestive evidence that a form of asymmetric cost efficiencies in television advertising benefited the entrants more than the incumbents. Specifically, the unit costs of local advertising tend to be higher than those of national advertising, which likely allowed the satellite operators to better leverage their national presence with (cheaper) national advertising.

Choosing the Light Meal: Real-Time Aggregation of Calorie Information Reduces Meal Calories,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211022367,03-Sep-21,01-Oct-21,58,5,948,967,"Numeric labeling of calories on restaurant menus has been implemented widely, but scientific studies have generally not found substantial effects on calories ordered. The present research tests the impact of a feedback format that is more targeted at how consumers select and revise their meals: real-time aggregation of calorie content to provide dynamic feedback about meal calories via a traffic light label. Because these labels intuitively signal when a meal shifts from healthy to unhealthy (via the change from green to a yellow or red light), they prompt decision makers to course-correct in real time, before they finalize their choice. Results from five preregistered experiments (N = 11,900) show that providing real-time traffic light feedback about the total caloric content of a meal reduces calories in orders, even compared with similar aggregated feedback in numeric format. Patterns of ordering reveal this effect to be driven by people revising high-calorie orders more frequently, leading them to choose fewer and lower-calorie items. Consumers also like traffic light aggregation, indicating greater satisfaction with their order and greater intentions to return to restaurants that use them. The authors discuss how dynamic feedback using intuitive signals could yield benefits in contexts beyond food choice.","Eric M. VanEpps, Andras Molnar, Julie S.

Overcoming the Cold Start Problem of Customer Relationship Management Using a Probabilistic Machine Learning Approach,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211032938,17-Sep-21,01-Oct-21,58,5,981,1006,"The success of customer relationship management programs ultimately depends on the firm's ability to identify and leverage differences across customers—a difficult task when firms attempt to manage new customers, for whom only the first purchase has been observed. The lack of repeated observations for these customers poses a structural challenge for firms to infer unobserved differences across them. This is what the authors call the “cold start” problem of customer relationship management, whereby companies have difficulties leveraging existing data when they attempt to make inferences about customers at the beginning of their relationship. The authors propose a solution to the cold start problem by developing a probabilistic machine learning modeling framework that leverages the information collected at the moment of acquisition. The main aspect of the model is that it flexibly captures latent dimensions that govern the behaviors observed at acquisition as well as future propensities to buy and to respond to marketing actions using deep exponential families. The model can be integrated with a variety of demand specifications and is flexible enough to capture a wide range of heterogeneity structures. The authors validate their approach in a retail context and empirically demonstrate the model's ability to identify high-value customers as well as those most sensitive to marketing actions right after their first purchase.","Nicolas Padilla, Eva Ascarza","customer relationship management, deep exponential families, probabilistic machine learning, cold start problem",11

In this research, seven studies, including an eye tracking study, a Facebook Ads field experiment, and lab and online experiments—all using real ads across diverse contexts—demonstrate that slow motion (vs. natural speed) can backfire and undercut product appeal by making the influence agent’s behavior seem more intentional and extrinsically motivated. The authors rule out several alternative explanations by showing that the effect attenuates for individuals with lower intentionality bias, is mitigated under cognitive load, and reverses when ads use nonhuman influence agents. The authors conclude by highlighting the potential for cross-pollination between visual information processing and social cognition research, particularly in contexts such as persuasion and trust, and they discuss managerial implications for visual marketing, especially on digital and social platforms.","Yunlu Yin, Jayson S.

The authors identify two inferences that help explain this effect: (1) consumers perceive crowdfunded products to be of higher quality, and (2) they believe that supporting crowdfunding reduces inequality in the marketplace. The authors further document an important boundary condition of the first inference: the identified effect reverses in high-risk domains (e.g., products that involve high physical risk) due to consumer perceptions that the crowdfunding model lacks sufficient professionalism to mitigate risk. With regard to the second inference, the authors find that the positive crowdfunding effect is particularly strong among consumers who value social equality. Taken together, this work sheds new light on consumer perceptions of crowdfunding, elucidates why and when consumers prefer crowdfunded products, and offers actionable implications for managers.","Oguz A.

The theory suggests that when team members are heterogeneous in sales abilities, the proposed maximum contract (where the team output is set by the largest individual sales output) dominates the average contract (where the team output is determined by the average output of team members) in terms of overall team effort. This is because the stronger team member will exert higher effort under the maximum contract compared with the average contract, and this increase exceeds the decrease in the weaker team member’s effort. The authors validate the theoretical predictions by employing two laboratory experiments to provide a causal test of the theory and two randomized field experiments to deliver additional corroborating evidence. Overall, the experimental results are consistent and broadly confirm the theoretical predictions, pointing to the substantial gains from implementing the maximum contract when team members are heterogeneous in abilities.

These ABIs are based on salespeople’s activity measures derived from their call reports. Despite their prevalence and theory-based expectations, there is a distinct lack of empirical work studying the sales productivity effects of ABI pay. With the cooperation of a large pharmaceutical firm, the authors conducted a three-year-long intervention based on a “treatment-removal” design. Their first intervention added modest ABI pay for frontline salespeople and their supervisors across 305 sales territories; the second intervention removed ABI pay from the salespeople; and the third intervention removed ABI pay from the supervisors as well, returning to the status quo. Using detailed territory-level data from the intervention in conjunction with syndicated market-level data and employing synthetic control procedures, the authors find sales gains of around 6%–9% from each of the two ABI interventions relative to the no-ABI baseline. These effects are moderated by the number of salespeople in a territory, with territories with more salespeople showing larger effects. Analyses of activity effects show that when supervisors are paid ABIs, they exert behavior control downward on salespeople. Managerially, both ABI schemes improve performance over an output-only pay plan. Between the two, a rudimentary gross profit impact calculation shows that ABIs targeted at supervisors alone are more efficient than ABIs targeted at both salespeople and their supervisors. The results support tying compensation to call reports despite the potential for self-serving biases in these measures because supervisors are able to exercise more behavior control with ABIs.","Raghunath Singh Rao, Madhu Viswanathan, George John,...","activity-based incentives, field experiments, sales compensation, principal-agent theory, synthetic control",5
How (and When) the Presence of Food Decreases Enjoyment of Customer Experiences,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211010465,22-Jun-21,01-Aug-21,58,4,705,720,"Consumers frequently engage in experiences (e.g., listening to music) in the presence of delicious food. Ten studies show that the presence (vs. absence) of such food decreases the enjoyment of a concurrent (target) experience across a wide array of consumption activities, such as listening to music, evaluating pictures, and coloring. The presence (vs. absence) of food prompts mental imagery of consuming that food, which decreases engagement with the target experience, resulting in lower enjoyment. Consistent with prior work on mental imagery, the effect occurs only for food that is considered tasty; when a food’s functional benefits are highlighted, the effect disappears. In addition, the effect can be triggered in the absence of food when participants are explicitly instructed to engage in mental imagery. The authors demonstrate the role of engagement by showing that the valence of the target experience moderates this effect, such that the presence of food decreases enjoyment of positive experiences but increases enjoyment of negative experiences. This work contributes to previous research on mental imagery and delayed consumption by highlighting the need to focus on how the presence of food affects concurrent experiences and provides important managerial insights given the proliferation of tasty food to enhance customer experience.","Emily N.

Interacting User-Generated Content Technologies: How Questions and Answers Affect Consumer Reviews,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211020274,23-Jun-21,01-Aug-21,58,4,742,761,"This article studies the question and answer (Q&A) technology of electronic commerce platforms, an increasingly common form of user-generated content that allows consumers to publicly ask product-specific questions and receive responses, either from the platform or from other customers. Using data from a major online retailer, the authors show that Q&As complement consumer reviews: unlike reviews, questions are primarily asked prepurchase and focus on clarification of product attributes rather than discussion of quality; answers convey fit-specific information in a predominantly sentiment-free way. Drawing on these observations, the authors hypothesize that Q&As mitigate product fit uncertainty, leading to better matches between products and consumers and, therefore, improved product ratings. Indeed, when products suffering from fit mismatch start receiving Q&As, their subsequent ratings improve by approximately .1 to .5 stars, and the fraction of negative reviews that discuss fit-related issues declines. The extent of the rating increase due to Q&As is proportional to the probability that purchasers will experience fit mismatch without Q&A. These findings suggest that, by resolving product fit uncertainty in an e-commerce setting, the addition of Q&As can be a viable way for retailers to improve ratings of products that have incurred low ratings due to customer–product fit mismatch.","Shrabastee Banerjee, Chrysanthos Dellarocas, Georgios Zervas","e-commerce, Q&A, reputation systems, user-generated content",4
"Religious Belief, Religious Priming, and Negative Word of Mouth",https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211011196,26-May-21,01-Aug-21,58,4,762,781,"This research examines the effects of religious belief and religious priming on negative word-of-mouth (NWOM) behavior. Drawing on social exchange and norm paradigms, the authors theorize and find evidence of the unique effects of religious belief and religious priming on NWOM in everyday service failure encounters. Specifically, they find that religious belief is associated with higher NWOM, driven by a greater sensitivity to violations of fairness norms, which in turn reduces forgiveness. However, exposure to religious priming attenuates NWOM among more religious consumers by reducing sensitivity to violations of fairness norms, which in turn enhances forgiveness. A field study involving over 1.2 million online reviews of actual restaurant experiences, in addition to four lab studies, provides support for the theorized effects. This study sheds light on the religion–forgiveness discrepancy by establishing the mediating role of sensitivity to fairness violations on the relationship between religion and forgiveness in the NWOM context. Further, the results demonstrate the importance of religion as a strategic variable in the management of service failure experiences, providing theoretical implications for the literature on the effects of religion on consumer behavior.","Riza Casidy, Adam Duhachek, Vishal Singh,...","negative word of mouth, online reviews, religious belief, religious priming, service failure",11
Strategic Polarization in Group Interactions,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211016389,22-Jun-21,01-Aug-21,58,4,782,800,"The authors study the phenomenon of strategic group polarization, in which members take more extreme actions than their preferences. The analysis is relevant for a broad range of formal and informal group settings, including social media, online platforms, sales teams, corporate and academic committees, and political action committees. In the model, agents with private preferences choose a public action (voice opinions), and the mean of their actions represents the group’s realized outcome. The agents face a trade-off between influencing the group decision and truth-telling. In a simultaneous-move game, agents strategically shade their actions toward the extreme. The strategic group influence motive can create substantial polarization in actions and group decisions even when the preferences are relatively moderate. Compared with a simultaneous game, a randomized-sequential-actions game lowers polarization when agents’ preferences are relatively similar. Sequential actions can even lead to moderation if the later agents have moderate preferences. Endogenizing the order of moves (through a first-price sealed-bid auction) always increases polarization, but it is also welfare enhancing. These findings can help group leaders, firms, and platforms design mechanisms that moderate polarization, such as the choice of speaking order, the group size, and the knowledge members have of others’ preferences and actions.","Ganesh Iyer, Hema Yoganarasimhan","polarization, collective decision making, social choice, lobbying, group interactions",1
The Performance Impact of Core-Component Outsourcing: Insights from the LCD TV Industry,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211010766,26-May-21,01-Aug-21,58,4,801,826,"Firms in technology markets often outsource the manufacture of core components—components that are central to product performance and comprise a substantial portion of product costs. Despite the strategic importance of core-component outsourcing, there is little empirical evidence (and many conflicting opinions) about its impact on consumer demand. The authors address this gap with an examination of panel data from the flat panel TV industry, across key regions globally. Results from their estimation indicate that core-component outsourcing reduces the firm’s ability to be on the technological frontier; this hurts demand, because the authors’ estimates suggest that consumers care about firms being on the frontier. However, such outsourcing also reduces costs. Finally, the authors find that outsourcing increases the intensity of competition in the marketplace.

Happiness Begets Money: Emotion and Engagement in Live Streaming,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211002477,20-Apr-21,01-Jun-21,58,3,417,438,"Live streaming offers an unprecedented opportunity for content creators (broadcasters) to deliver their content to consumers (viewers) in real time. In a live stream, viewers may send virtual gifts (tips) to the broadcaster and engage with likes and chats free of charge. These activities reflect viewers’ underlying emotion and are likely to be affected by the broadcaster’s emotion. This article examines the role of emotion in interactive and dynamic business settings such as live streaming. To account for the possibility that broadcaster emotion, viewer emotion, and viewer activities influence each other, the authors estimate a panel vector autoregression model on data at the minute level from 1,450 live streams. The results suggest that a happier broadcaster makes the audience happier and begets intensified viewer activities, in particular tips. In addition, broadcasters reciprocate viewer engagement with more smiles. Further analyses suggest that these effects are pronounced only after a live stream has been active for a while, and they manifest only in streams by broadcasters who have more experience, receive more tips, or are more popular in past live streams. These results help platforms and broadcasters optimize marketing interventions such as broadcaster emotion enhancement in live streaming and quantify the financial returns.","Yan Lin, Dai Yao, Xingyu Chen","digital marketing, emotion, engagement, live streaming, social media, text analysis, video analysis",2
Navigating Shared Consumption Experiences: Clarity About a Partner’s Interests Increases Enjoyment,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211002818,12-Apr-21,01-Jun-21,58,3,439,455,"Consumers frequently engage in activities with others, such as visiting an art gallery with a friend or going to a sports match with a family member, and they tend to assume that sharing experiences with another person will make these activities more enjoyable. However, navigating a shared experience—making decisions about pacing, sequencing, and interacting with another person as the experience unfolds—can take consumers’ attention away from the activity, potentially reducing their enjoyment. In a series of studies in which consumers engage in real consumption experiences, the authors show that lack of clarity about a partner’s interests can distract consumers, making it difficult for them to focus on the shared activity and reducing their enjoyment of shared experiences relative to solo experiences. Notably, simple interventions can increase clarity of a partner’s interests and consumers’ enjoyment of shared activities, providing tools for service providers who want to retain customers and benefit from positive word of mouth.","Yuechen Wu, Rebecca W.

Two pilot studies show that most marketers have a surprisingly strong lay intuition about the existence of this inference bias, admit that they are frequently affected by it, and try to avoid it when predicting consumer preferences. Moreover, the pilot studies indicate that most marketers use a very natural and straightforward approach to avoid the false consensus effect in practice, that is, they simply try to “suppress” (i.e., ignore) their personal preferences when predicting consumer preferences. Ironically, four subsequent studies show that this frequently used tactic can backfire and increase marketers’ susceptibility to the false consensus effect. Specifically, the results suggest that these backfire effects are most likely to occur for marketers with a low level of preference certainty. In contrast, the results imply that preference suppression does not backfire but instead decreases the false consensus effect for marketers with a high level of preference certainty. Finally, the studies explore the mechanism behind these results and show how marketers can ultimately avoid the false consensus effect—regardless of their level of preference certainty and without risking backfire effects.","Walter Herzog, Johannes D.

Unlike traditional consumer products, auto loans have a long-term impact on consumers’ financial state because of the monthly payment obligation. Using a large consumer panel data set of credit and employment information, the authors find that receiving a bonus increases auto loan demand by 21%. These loans, however, are associated with higher risk, as the delinquency rate increases by 18.5%–31.4% depending on different measures. In contrast, an increase in consumers’ base salary will increase their demand for auto loans but not their delinquency. By comparing consumers with bonuses with those without bonuses, the authors find that bonus payments lead to both demand expansion and demand shifting on auto loans. The empirical findings help shed light on how consumers make financial decisions and have important implications for financial institutions on when demand for auto loans and the associated risk arise.","Zhenling Jiang, Dennis J.

The authors observe both individual-level and contextual-level variation in the degree to which consumers feel psychological ownership of borrowed money, and variation on this dimension predicts willingness to borrow money for discretionary purchases. At an individual level, psychological ownership of borrowed money is distinct from other individual factors such as debt aversion, financial literacy, income, intertemporal discounting, materialism, propensity to plan, self-control, spare money, and tightwad–spendthrift tendencies, and it predicts willingness to borrow above and beyond these factors. At a contextual level, the authors document systematic differences in psychological ownership between different debt types. They show that these differences in psychological ownership manifest in consumers’ online search behavior and explain consumers’ differential interest in borrowing across debt types. Finally, the authors demonstrate that psychological ownership of borrowed money is malleable, such that framing debt using language lower in psychological ownership can reduce consumers’ propensity to borrow.","Eesha Sharma, Stephanie Tully, Cynthia Cryder","consumer finances, debt, financial decision making, mental accounting, psychological ownership",20

The authors argue that firms learn from peers’ decisions to reduce the uncertainty in their own advertising disclosure, and they empirically investigate information-based organizational herding in the context of advertising spending disclosure, where a 1994 reporting rule made advertising spending disclosures voluntary in the United States. The authors examine whether a firm relies on information from benchmark leaders or similar peers to resolve disclosure uncertainty. A novel identification strategy, which uses partially overlapping strategic groups to mitigate simultaneity and correlated unobservables, shows robust evidence for herding effects among peer firms in the same strategic group. Moreover, firms are more likely to resolve disclosure uncertainty from similar peers rather than from benchmark leaders. The authors discuss how firms can use knowledge of competitors’ predicted advertising disclosure decisions conditional on their disclosure to their strategic advantage in product and financial markets.","Huanhuan Shi, Rajdeep Grewal, Hari Sridhar","advertising spending, financial markets, herding, product markets, voluntary disclosure",1
Incentives Increase Relative Positivity of Review Content and Enjoyment of Review Writing,https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211010439,23-Apr-21,01-Jun-21,58,3,539,558,"A series of controlled experiments examine how the strategy of incentivizing reviews influences consumers’ expressions of positivity. Incentivized (vs. unincentivized) reviews contained a greater proportion of positive relative to negative emotion across a variety of product and service experiences (e.g., videos, service providers, consumer packaged goods companies). This effect occurred for both financial and nonfinancial incentives and when assessing review content across multiple natural language processing tools and human judgments. Incentives influence review content by modifying the experience of writing reviews. That is, when incentives are associated with review writing, they cause the positive affect that results from receiving an incentive to transfer to the review-writing experience, making review writing more enjoyable. In line with this process, the effect of an incentive on review positivity attenuates when incentives are weakly (vs. strongly) associated with review writing (i.e., incentive for “participating in an experiment” vs. “writing a review”) and when the incentive does not transfer positive affect (i.e., when an incentive is provided by a disliked company). By examining when incentives do (vs. do not) adjust the relative positivity of written reviews, this research offers theoretical insight into the literature on incentives, motivation, and word of mouth, with practical implications for managers.","Kaitlin Woolley, Marissa A.

This association of political identity with preference for SEPs is moderated by self-focus.

How Life-Role Transitions Shape Consumer Responses to Brand Extensions,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720986546,17-Mar-21,01-Jun-21,58,3,579,594,"Life-role transition is a state wherein people pass through different life stages, involving changes in identities, roles, and responsibilities. Across six studies, the current research shows that consumers under life-role transition have more favorable attitudes toward distant (i.e., low- or moderate-fit) brand extensions than consumers who are not under life-role transition. The effect is driven by a sense of self-concept ambiguity associated with life-role transition, which subsequently prompts dialectical thinking that helps improve perceived fit between a parent brand and its extension, finally resulting in more favorable brand extension evaluation. This effect diminishes for (1) near (i.e., high-fit) brand extensions that do not require dialectical thinking for perceiving fit; (2) for sub-brand (vs. direct brand) architecture, for which there is less of a need to use dialectical thinking to reconcile the inconsistencies between a parent brand and its extension; and (3) when consumers perceive they have resources to cope with the life-role transition, which attenuates self-concept ambiguity. This research offers important theoretical and managerial insights by focusing on life-role transition—an important aspect of consumers’ lives that has been largely underresearched—and by demonstrating how and why it elicits more favorable attitudes toward brand extensions.","Lei Su, Alokparna (Sonia) Basu Monga, Yuwei Jiang","brand extensions, dialectical thinking, life-role transition, self-concept ambiguity",2

In turn, this leads to inflated risk judgments.

Two field experiments manipulating the marketing communications sent to 1,453 consumers diagnosed with 87 diseases of varying stigma potential, as well as two Amazon Mechanical Turk studies, reveal that consumers with potentially stigmatizing attributes distinctly decode aspects of marketing communications as audience cues, to infer how (un)favorable observers of their consumption will be in light of the potential stigma. When consumers possess potentially stigmatizing attributes, audience cues influence social devaluation inferences, which influence their beneficial consumption (program enrollment, long-term engagement in health care program; e.g., 64% click-through decrease) and their interest in detrimental consumption (products that promise to alleviate the stigma but are associated with considerable risks).

Because agentic men are more self-focused, their payment decisions are motivated by economic factors, resulting in lower payments. Conversely, communal women are more other-focused, and their payment decisions are motivated by both social and economic factors, resulting in higher payments.

Because beliefs are rarely observed, researchers typically assume that consumers have rational expectations or update beliefs consistent with Bayesian updating. These assumptions are restrictive and do not enable the researcher or the retailer to price discriminate among consumers on the basis of heterogeneity in beliefs. The authors use Monte Carlo experiments to show how these assumptions affect estimates of search cost. Next, they design an incentive-aligned online study in which participants search over the price of a homogeneous good, and the authors elicit distributions of price beliefs before and after each search. Drawing on data collected from a nationally representative panel, they find substantial heterogeneity in prior price beliefs, such that participants update their beliefs in response to search outcomes but deviate from Bayesian updating in that they underreact to new information. Importantly, the authors show that (1) assuming Bayesian updating does not significantly bias search cost estimates at the aggregate level if the researcher accounts for heterogeneous prior beliefs, (2) eliciting heterogeneity in prior expected prices is much more important than eliciting heterogeneity in prior price uncertainty, and (3) a retailer can increase profits through third-degree price discrimination by recognizing the heterogeneity in prior beliefs.","Pranav Jindal, Anocha Aribarg","Bayesian updating, consumer search, price beliefs, rational expectations, search costs, sequential search",1

A consumer processes both “confirmatory” and “disconfirmatory” information to their prior belief, but to different degrees under different conditions. In general, if the consumer has an extreme prior, or if the unit cost of processing information is high such that only a small amount of information is optimally processed, they process more confirmatory than disconfirmatory information; this offers a rational explanation for the phenomenon known as “confirmation bias.” The authors also find that a seller can benefit by influencing the consumer’s attention allocation by strategically choosing how much favorable and unfavorable information to make available for the consumer to process and by influencing the information processing cost, where the optimal strategy depends on the seller’s ability to adjust product price. Surprisingly, a seller has a lower incentive to suppress unfavorable information when the consumer has a worse prior belief about product fit.

Making the World a Better Place: How Crowdfunding Increases Consumer Demand for Social-Good Products,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720970445,22-Dec-20,01-Apr-21,58,2,363,376,"Crowdfunding has emerged as an alternative means of financing new ventures wherein a large number of individuals collectively back a project. This research specifically examines reward-based crowdfunding, in which those who take part in the crowdfunding process receive the new product for which funding is sought in return for their financial support. This work illustrates that consumers make fundamentally different decisions when considering whether to contribute their money to crowdfund versus purchase a product. Six studies demonstrate that compared with a traditional purchase, crowdfunding more strongly activates an interdependent mindset and, as a result, increases consumer demand for social-good products (i.e., products with positive social and/or environmental impact). The research further highlights that an active involvement in the crowdfunding process is necessary to increase demand for social-good products: when a previously crowdfunded product is already to market, the effect is eliminated. Finally, it is demonstrated that crowdfunding participants exhibit an increased demand for social-good products only when collective efficacy (i.e., one’s belief in the collective’s ability to bring about change) is high.","Bonnie Simpson, Martin Schreier, Sally Bitterl,...","collective-efficacy beliefs, construal level, crowdfunding, interdependent self-construal, social-good products",32

Uncertainty Evokes Consumers’ Preference for Brands Incongruent with their Global–Local Citizenship Identity,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720972956,25-Jan-21,01-Apr-21,58,2,400,415,"This research demonstrates that under states of certainty, consumers with a relatively stronger global (local) identity prefer global (local) brands, whereas under states of uncertainty, consumers with a relatively stronger global (local) identity prefer local (global) brands. This effect occurs because uncertainty (certainty) activates a divergent (convergent) thinking style, which results in a preference for options that are more distant from (closer to) the identity to which consumers associate more strongly. The effect holds both when individuals’ global–local citizenship identity is measured and when it is manipulated. The research further establishes an important boundary condition for the effect. The effect holds in the citizenship identity context because people normally associate themselves with both local and global citizenship identities, and situational or dispositional factors only influence the degree to which they associate with each identity. The effect does not surface when individuals construe their local–global citizenship identities as interfering, meaning they conceive that holding one identity conflicts with holding the other.","Sharon Ng, Ali Faraji-Rad, Rajeev Batra","globalization, branding, identity, uncertainty, creativity, divergent thinking",2

The proposed efficient, implementable learning algorithm is proven to rapidly converge to the optimal strategy while achieving zero regret and constituting a competitive equilibrium. This is the first algorithmic solution to the online knapsack problem to offer such theoretical guarantees without assuming a priori knowledge of object values or costs. Furthermore, it meets advertiser requirements by accommodating any valuation metric while satisfying budget constraints. Across a series of 100 simulated and 10 real-world campaigns, the algorithm delivers 98% of the value achievable with perfect foresight and outperforms the best available alternative by 11%. Finally, we show how the algorithm can be augmented to simultaneously estimate impression values and learn the bidding policy. Across a series of simulations, we show that the total regret delivered under this dual objective is less than that from any competing algorithm required only to learn the bidding policy.","Srinivas Tunuguntla, Paul R.

"The Impact of Soda Taxes: Pass-Through, Tax Avoidance, and Nutritional Effects",https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720969401,21-Dec-20,01-Feb-21,58,1,22,49,"The authors analyze the impact of a tax on sweetened beverages using a unique data set of prices, quantities sold, and nutritional information across several thousand taxed and untaxed beverages for a large set of stores in Philadelphia and its surrounding area. The tax is passed through at an average rate of 97%, leading to a 34% price increase. Demand in the taxed area decreases by 46% in response to the tax. Cross-shopping to stores outside of Philadelphia offsets more than half of the reduction in sales in the city and decreases the net reduction in sales of taxed beverages to only 22%. There is no significant substitution to bottled water and modest substitution to untaxed natural juices. The authors show that tax avoidance through cross-shopping severely constrains revenue generation and nutritional improvement, thus making geographic coverage an important policy decision.","Stephan Seiler, Anna Tuchman, Song Yao","pass-through, policy evaluation, sin taxes, tax avoidance, tax design",26
Incorporating Consumer Product Categorizations into Shelf Layout Design,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720964127,26-Nov-20,01-Feb-21,58,1,50,73,"Using one field and two online lab experiments, this article shows that congruency between shelf layout and a consumer’s internal product categorization increases the perceived variety of the assortment and reduces the perceived complexity of the shelf layout. These assortment perceptions, in turn, heighten purchase intention and satisfaction toward the chosen item. Results are robust across internal categorization measurements (planogram design vs. sorting tasks), congruency measures (distance- vs. matching-based), and products (biscuits vs. yogurt snacks). In the field study, familiarity—operationalized as either consumption frequency or subjective product knowledge—increased the overall effect of categorization congruency and strengthened its pathway through perceived variety (vs. the one through complexity). The authors show how their research can be exploited to improve shelf layouts by optimizing the external categorization.

Gremlins in the Data: Identifying the Information Content of Research Subjects,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720965930,16-Dec-20,01-Feb-21,58,1,74,94,"Empirical demand functions, such as those from choice-based conjoint analyses, are critical to many aspects of marketing. Approaches have been developed to ensure that research subjects provide honest and thoughtful responses. However, to reduce costs, researchers increasingly collect data online, under conditions that compromise the value of the information provided. Objective measures related to how the study is completed, such as latency (how quickly answers are given), can only be tied to other objective measures (such as the consistency of the answers), but ultimately their relationship to the subject’s utility function is questionable. To address this problem, the authors introduce a mixture modeling framework that clusters subjects based on variances. The proposed model naturally groups subjects based on their internal consistency. The authors argue that a higher level of internal consistency (i.e., lower variance) reflects more engaged consumers who have sufficient experience with the product category and choice task. “Gremlins,” in contrast, behave such that the noise in their responses overwhelms any signal, leading to a lack of predictive power. This approach provides an automated way to determine which respondents are relevant.

Others’ competitive prior ideas interfere with idea generation, as new ideas need to be differentiated from the preceding ones to be original. Exposure to an increasing number of prior ideas thus heightens individuals’ perceived constraints of expressing ideas and harms creative performance (Studies 2 and 3). Furthermore, creative performance monotonically reduces with an increasing number of prior ideas (Study 4). A final study demonstrates that showing only a limited number of ideas as well as grouping prior ideas offer actionable ways to reduce prior ideas’ harmful influence (Study 5).

The Effect of Information Disclosure on Industry Payments to Physicians,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720972106,17-Dec-20,01-Feb-21,58,1,115,140,"In 2019, U.S. pharmaceutical companies paid $3.6 billion to physicians in the form of gifts to promote their drugs. To curb inappropriate financial relationships between health care providers and firms, several state laws require firms to publicly declare the payments they make to physicians. In 2013, this disclosure law was rolled out to all 50 states. The authors investigate the causal impact of this increased transparency on subsequent payments between firms and physicians. While firms and physicians were informed of the disclosure regulation at data collection, complete transparency did not occur until the data were published online. The authors estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects of the online data disclosure exploiting the phased rollout of the disclosure laws across states, facilitated by recent advances in machine learning methods. Using a 29-month national panel covering $100 million in payments between 16 antidiabetic brands and 50,000 physicians, the authors find that the monthly payments changed insignificantly, on average, due to disclosure. However, the average null effect masks some unintended consequences of disclosure, wherein payments may have increased for more expensive drugs and among physicians who prescribed more heavily. The authors further explore potential mechanisms that can parsimoniously describe the data pattern.","Tong Guo, S.

Using a longitudinal data set that combines SDIAS of 1,243 school districts with academic performance and disciplinary records of more than 9,000 Texas public schools between 2000 and 2014, the authors find that a one-standard-deviation increase in SDIAS (an average increase of $.6 million) is associated with an improvement in eight academic performance indicators, with effect sizes ranging from 2% to 5% of a standard deviation, amounting to a $.8 million to $1.8 million increase in cumulative income for the current students of a school district. Furthermore, a one-standard-deviation increase in SDIAS is associated with a 5% increase in Part II offense–related school disciplinary problems, amounting to a yearly cost of $25,800 to $53,440 for a school district.

In contrast, high-PDB consumers prefer designer-designed to user-designed products due to their stronger trust in designer-driven companies. Six studies examining power distance belief at both the country and individual levels provide convergent support for the proposed moderating effect of PDB and underlying mechanisms.

Involving Sales Managers in Sales Force Compensation Design,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720969174,14-Dec-20,01-Feb-21,58,1,182,201,"Sales force incentive design often involves significant participation by sales managers in designing the compensation plans of salespeople who report to them. Although sales managers hold valuable territory-level information, they may benefit from misrepresenting that information given their own incentives. The author uses a game theoretic model to show (1) how a firm can efficiently leverage a manager’s true knowledge and (2) the conditions under which involving the manager is optimal. Under the proposed approach, the firm delegates sales incentive decisions to the manager within restrictive constraints. She can then request relaxed constraints by fulfilling certain requirements. The author shows how these constraints and requirements can be set to ensure the firm’s best possible outcome given the manager’s information. Thus, this “request mechanism” offers an efficient, reliable alternative to approaches often used in practice to incorporate managerial input, such as internal negotiations and behind-the-scenes lobbying. The author then identifies the conditions under which this mechanism outperforms the well-established theoretical approach of offering the salesperson a menu of contracts to reveal territory-level information.",Rob Waiser,"agency theory, asymmetric information, delegation, sales force compensation, sales manager",11

However, studies of this relationship have been limited to competitive markets, and monopolistic markets have been largely ignored. This study explores the large and important utilities market and exploits its unique regulatory requirements that generate detailed and reliable operating and accounting data to examine the overall relationship between customer satisfaction and utility profit and establish the causal mechanisms involved. Using data from U.S. public utility firms, the authors show that even when customer satisfaction does not affect future revenues, it does positively predict future profitability by reducing utility firm operating costs. More specifically, they find that higher satisfaction reduces the costs of utility firm distribution, customer service, and sales and general administration expenses. These findings and additional post hoc evidence are consistent with the notion that customer satisfaction (1) generates efficiency-enhancing benefits for utility firms by lowering the direct and employee engagement costs of dealing with dissatisfied customers and (2) fosters greater trust and cooperation from customers. This study has important implications for both managers and regulators and provides important new insights for market-based asset theory and regulatory economic theory.","Abhi Bhattacharya, Neil A.

Scalable Target Marketing: Distributed Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Bayesian Hierarchical Models,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720952410,01-Oct-20,01-Dec-20,57,6,999,1018,"Many problems in marketing and economics require firms to make targeted consumer-specific decisions, but current estimation methods are not designed to scale to the size of modern data sets.

They develop a distributed Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for estimating Bayesian hierarchical models when the number of consumers is very large and the objects of interest are the consumer-level parameters. The two-stage and embarrassingly parallel algorithm is asymptotically unbiased in the number of consumers, retains the flexibility of a standard MCMC algorithm, and is easy to implement. The authors show that the distributed MCMC algorithm is faster and more efficient than a single-machine algorithm by at least an order of magnitude. They illustrate the approach with simulations with up to 100 million consumers, and with data on 1,088,310 donors to a charitable organization.

Charting the Path to Purchase Using Topic Models,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720954376,14-Oct-20,01-Dec-20,57,6,1019,1036,"In gathering information for an intended purchase decision, consumers submit search phrases to online search engines. These search phrases directly express the consumers’ needs in their own words and thus provide valuable information to marketing managers. Interpreting consumers’ search phrases renders a better understanding of their purchase intentions, which is critical for marketing success. In this article, the authors develop an integrated model to connect the latent topics embedded in consumers’ search phrases to their website visits and purchase decisions. Using a unique data set containing more than 8,000 search phrases submitted by consumers, the model identifies latent topics underlying the searches that led consumers to the firm’s website. Compared with a model lacking any textual information from consumers’ search phrases, a model using textual data in a heuristic approach, and a model based on the latent Dirichlet allocation, the proposed model provides a better evaluation of a consumer’s position on the path to purchase and achieves much better predictive accuracy, which could in turn substantially increase the firm’s revenue. The authors also extend the discussion to aggregators, affiliated websites, and segments of consumers who are exposed to the firm’s outbound ads. Marketing managers can use this method to extract structured information from consumers’ search phrases to facilitate their inference of consumers’ latent purchase states and thereby improve marketing efficiency.","Hongshuang (Alice) Li, Liye Ma","path to purchase, search phrase, textual analysis, topic model, hidden Markov model",1
Where Do You Want to Go for Dinner? A Preference Expression Asymmetry in Joint Consumption,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720949497,22-Sep-20,01-Dec-20,57,6,1037,1054,"This research introduces a framework wherein consumers take on “requestor” or “responder” roles in making joint consumption decisions. The authors document a robust preference expression asymmetry wherein “requestors” soliciting others’ consumption preferences (e.g., “Where do you want to go for dinner?”) desire preference expressions (e.g., “Let’s go to this restaurant”), whereas “responders” instead do not express preferences (e.g., “Anywhere is fine with me”). This asymmetry generalizes under a broad set of situations and occurs because the requestor and responder roles differ in their foci. Compared to responders, requestors are more focused on mitigating the difficulty of arriving at a decision, whereas compared to requestors, responders are more focused on conveying likability by appearing easygoing. Responders thus behave suboptimally, incurring a “preference cost” (when masking preferences) and a “social friction cost” (requestors favor responders who express preferences). Requestors can elicit preference expression by conveying their own dislike of decision making, which increases responders’ focus on mitigating decision difficulty. The authors conclude by discussing the framework’s contributions to looking “under the hood” of joint consumption decisions.","Peggy J. Liu, Kate E.

Customer dissatisfaction has a more pronounced effect on short selling compared with customer satisfaction. In addition, customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction are more relevant for firms with low capital intensity and firms that face lower competitive intensity.

Open Negotiation: The Back-End Benefits of Salespeople’s Transparency in the Front End,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720951153,01-Oct-20,01-Dec-20,57,6,1076,1094,"Negotiations today are less likely to be characterized by information asymmetry—the notion that buyers are less informed than sellers—due to the amount of information available to buyers. A number of industries have reacted to this change by shifting their attention to earning profits in aftermarkets: products and services that augment the main purchase (e.g., add-ons, insurance, financing, service and maintenance). In these aftermarkets, firms often retain an information advantage, even if information asymmetries are eliminated from the main purchase. This has given rise to an interesting setting untapped by prior research: information “symmetry” in the front end (main purchase) and information “asymmetry” in the back end (aftermarket). The authors argue that symmetry in the front end provides an opportunity to build trust, as the knowledgeable customer can verify the information disclosed by the seller. In an observational study in the automotive industry, the authors find that customers to whom the salesperson revealed the cost of a car at the beginning of the negotiation spent significantly more in the back end than others. As corroborated in subsequent studies, this effect holds only when cost is disclosed at the beginning of the negotiation and when customers can verify the cost information.","Yashar Atefi, Michael Ahearne, Sebastian Hohenberg,...","aftermarkets, information asymmetry, information disclosure, negotiation, trust",44

Whereas prior research has shown that a default can affect what consumers purchase by promoting choice of the preselected option, the influence of defaults is more nuanced when consumers make a series of related choices. In such a setting, consumer preferences may evolve across choices due to “spillover” effects from one choice to subsequent choices. The authors hypothesize that defaults systematically attenuate choice spillover effects because accepting a default is a more passive process than either choosing a nondefault option in the presence of a default or making a choice in the absence of a default. Three experiments and a field study provide compelling evidence for such default-induced changes in choice spillover effects. The findings show that firms’ setting of high-price defaults with the aim of influencing consumers to choose more expensive products can backfire through the attenuation of spillover. In addition to advancing the understanding of the interplay between defaults and preference dynamics, insights from this research have important practical implications for firms applying defaults in sequential choices.","Bas Donkers, Benedict G.C.

Whereas direct channel usage predominantly lowers agency conflicts in terms of information asymmetry and sales partner moral hazard, indirect channel usage amplifies moral hazard concerns. How those sales partner effects translate into manufacturer performance outcomes critically depends on governance mechanisms, confirming predictions from governance value analysis: formalization enhances performance outcomes for manufacturers in the case of indirect channel usage but diminishes performance in the case of direct channel usage. The authors observe converse effects for centralization and information exchange: centralization and information exchange enhance outcomes of direct channel usage but diminish outcomes of indirect channel usage.

Should Your Brand Pick a Side?

Moreover, research on identity-based consumption and negativity bias suggests that corporate political advocacy (CPA) is more likely to repel existing customers who oppose the CPA than to attract new customers who support it, implying that the net effect will be negative even if consumers overall are evenly divided in their support/opposition. In this research, the authors posit that despite this negativity bias in individual-level choice, the net effect of CPA at the market level is determined by a sorting process that benefits small-share brands and hurts large-share brands. This is because having few customers to lose and many to gain can offset the risk of the negativity bias in consumers’ identity-driven responses to CPA, potentially leading to a net influx of customers for small-share brands. Five experiments provide support for this theorizing and identify authenticity as a necessary condition for small share brands to benefit.","Chris Hydock, Neeru Paharia, Sean Blair","brand activism, choice share, corporate political advocacy, identity-based consumption, market share, negativity bias, political orientation",5

The authors identify one such cue: the number of users the prospective influencer is following. Using a combination of real-world data analysis and controlled lab experiments, they show that following fewer others, conditional on having a substantial number of followers, has a positive effect on a social media user’s perceived influence. Further, the authors find greater perceived influence impacts engagement with the content shared in terms of other users exhibiting more favorable attitudes toward it (i.e., likes) and a greater propensity to spread it (i.e., retweets).

The magnitude of the bias in the state dependence parameter can be as large as a factor of 2–2.5. The authors propose a solution to the initial conditions problem that samples the initial states as auxiliary variables in a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure. The approach assumes that the joint distribution of prices and consumer choices is in equilibrium, which is plausible for the mature consumer packaged goods products commonly used in empirical applications. In Monte Carlo simulations, the approach recovers the true parameter values even in relatively short panels.

The authors utilize store count and revenues for franchised and company-owned outlets of nationwide convenience store chains in 47 geographical markets in Japan between 1984 and 2010. The empirical analyses show that strategic considerations in entry and expansion, ignored in the literature on franchising, appear to influence an organizational-form decision: firms rely more on company-owned outlets for expansion when the threat of entry from competitor firms in adjacent markets increases. The authors examine two interpretations: the convenience of quick deployment and a credible signal. Numerical analyses of a simple dynamic model of entry and franchising confirm that company-owned-outlet-based expansion arises under heightened entry threat. The simulation analysis highlights how franchising decisions in response to an elevated threat of entry may be beneficial (or harmful) for an incumbent firm, which yields key implications for firms, consumers, and policy makers.","Mitsukuni Nishida, Nathan Yang","entry accommodation, entry deterrence, franchising, organizational-form choice, retailing, threat of entry",10

Locational Choices: Modeling Consumer Preferences for Proximity to Others in Reserved Seating Venues,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720941525,14-Aug-20,01-Oct-20,57,5,878,899,"This article proposes a measurement approach to determine how consumers prefer to locate themselves in proximity to others during consumption experiences, such as when they purchase reserved seating tickets to a performance. Applied to data from locational choice experiments that simulate reserved seating assortments, administered to more than 2,000 participants, this approach reveals the importance of modeling proximity to others when studying locational choices. It also emphasizes the degree to which consumers are heterogeneous in their preferences for proximity to both focal elements (e.g., stage, screen, aisles) and other consumers. Therefore, event operators should collect data beyond purchase ticket logs and also include consumers who did not purchase. Furthermore, this study illustrates how managers can use fitted, individual-level parameters and an optimization model to make more effective seat-level availability decisions. In addition to these recommendations for managers of reserved seating venues, this article offers novel contributions to research related to advance selling, spatial models, and personal space.","Simon J.

Consumer Search and Filtering on Online Retail Platforms,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720928367,29-Jun-20,01-Oct-20,57,5,900,916,"This article examines how the consumer’s search cost and filtering on a retail platform affect the platform, the third-party sellers, and the consumers. The authors show that, given the platform’s percentage referral fee, a lower search cost can either increase or decrease the platform’s profit. By contrast, if the platform optimally adjusts its referral fee, a lower search cost will increase the platform’s profit. As the consumer’s search cost decreases, if the platform’s demand elasticity increases significantly, the platform should reduce its fee, potentially resulting in an all-win outcome for the platform, the sellers, and the consumers; otherwise, a lower search cost will increase the platform’s optimal fee percentage, potentially leading to higher equilibrium retail prices. Furthermore, the availability of filtering on the platform will in expectation induce consumers to search fewer products but buy products with higher match values, and filtering can either increase or decrease equilibrium retail prices. When filtering reveals only a small amount of the products’ match-value variations, it will benefit the platform, the sellers, and the consumers. This article shows that the effects of filtering and those of a decrease in search cost are qualitatively different.","Baojun Jiang, Tianxin Zou","channel, competition, e-commerce, filtering, pricing, retail platform, search",2
Face Forward: How Employees’ Digital Presence on Service Websites Affects Customer Perceptions of Website and Employee Service Quality,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720934863,15-Jul-20,01-Oct-20,57,5,917,936,"Confronted with increasing digitalization, service firms are challenged to sustain customer loyalty. A promising means to do so is to leverage the digital presence of service employees on their website. A large-scale field study and several experimental studies show that the digital presence of service employees on the firm website increases current website service quality perceptions and positively shapes memories related to employee service quality perceptions from past service encounters. Both effects indirectly increase customer loyalty and, in turn, financial performance, and are amplified by employee accessibility and a service firm’s customer orientation. The authors examine further boundary conditions for the memory process: only service employees evoke the beneficial spillover effect to employee service quality perceptions, and the spillover effect does not generalize to evaluations of product quality. Remarkably, an employee’s digital presence, although factually unrelated, augments customer perceptions of service employees’ competence and commitment and thus strengthens rather than erodes service employees’ role in customer–firm relationships. Theoretical and managerial implications deepen the understanding of how to add a human touch to digital channels.","Dennis Herhausen, Oliver Emrich, Dhruv Grewal,...","digital presence, online customer experience, reconstructive memory process, service employees, service quality, social presence, spillover effect",18
Customization in Luxury Brands: Can Valentino Get Personal?,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720943191,31-Jul-20,01-Oct-20,57,5,937,947,"Luxury brands have started to offer consumers the opportunity to customize their exclusive products by making certain aesthetic decisions, such as the color, fabric, or cut of their products. A robust finding in the marketing literature is that consumers place a greater value on customized than on standard products because these unique products better fit and communicate their tastes, preferences, and identity. However, the majority of focal products in these studies fall outside the luxury segment. The authors demonstrate that consumers’ customization preferences differ between mainstream and luxury brands. In the luxury segment, consumers pay a premium for the designer’s expertise and the status that it can convey. As such, the consumers’ desire for self-expression can potentially erode the product’s signaling value. Through a series of four experiments, the authors demonstrate that luxury brands can benefit from customization but they can also take customization too far. Their findings suggest that brand managers should allow consumers to make fewer design decisions for luxury versus mainstream brands to preserve the signal value created by the designer.","C.

Cutting Calories: The Preference for Lower Caloric Density Versus Smaller Quantities Among Restrained and Unrestrained Eaters,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720949163,17-Aug-20,01-Oct-20,57,5,948,965,"The marketplace includes many attractive high-calorie indulgent food offerings. Despite their appeal, consumers may often be prompted to consider lower-calorie-package offerings instead (e.g., 100-calorie packs). The question thus arises: What predicts consumers’ preferences between different kinds of lower-calorie offerings? The authors conceptualize two different routes to lower-calorie versions of indulgent foods: a lower-caloric-density version (e.g., baked potato chips) or a smaller-portion-size version (e.g., a smaller bag of potato chips). The authors examine how such versions are differentially preferred and why, focusing on the key role of dietary restraint. The authors show that as dietary restraint increases, the preference for a lower-calorie version created via lower caloric density (vs. a smaller portion size) increases. Differential weights placed on health and fullness goals help explain differing preferences across dietary restraint (as the lower-caloric-density version is perceived as healthier and more filling, albeit less tasty, than the smaller-portion-size version). This framework offers theoretical implications for understanding two routes to cutting calories, practical implications for food marketers, and methodological implications for studying food choices.","Peggy J.

Then, through three lab experiments the authors illustrate that after consumers are exposed to consumption regulations from the government (e.g., laws that restrict consumption, warning labels designed by the Food and Drug Administration), conservatives (vs. liberals) are more likely to (1) use phones when restricted (Study 2), (2) purchase unhealthy foods (Study 3), and (3) view smoking e-cigarettes more favorably (Study 4). No such effects are observed when a nongovernment source is used, or when the message from the government is framed as a notification (vs. warning).

In this article, the authors examine a public health outcome—birth rate—associated with advertisements for erectile dysfunction (ED) drugs. Since the United States loosened regulations on direct-to-consumer television advertising for prescription drugs in 1997, ED drug makers have consistently been top spenders. By comparing advertising data with multiple birth data sets (patient-level hospital data from Massachusetts between 2001 and 2010 and micro birth certificate data from the United States between 2000 and 2004), the authors demonstrate that increased ED drug television advertising leads to a higher birth rate. Their results, which are robust with respect to different functional forms and falsification tests, show that a 1% increase in ED drug advertising contributes to an increase of .04%–.08% of total births. Their findings suggest that beyond the customer purchase decision, advertising can have important public health outcomes, with resulting implications for managerial decision making and policy formulation.","Tongil “TI” Kim, Diwas KC","advertising, birth rate, border identification, fertility, health care marketing, public policy",63
Contour-as-Face Framework: A Method to Preserve Privacy and Perception,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720920256,04-May-20,01-Aug-20,57,4,617,639,"Consumers and marketers use facial information to make important inferences about others in many business contexts. However, consumers and firms are increasingly concerned about privacy and discrimination. To address privacy–perception trade-offs, the authors propose a novel contour-as-face (CaF) framework that transforms face images into contour images incorporating both the nonoutline and outline features of facial parts. In three empirical studies, the authors (1) compare human perceptions of face and contour images along 15 dimensions commonly assessed in marketing contexts; (2) investigate the effectiveness of contour images for protecting anonymity related to identity, age, and gender; and (3) implement the CaF framework in a real-life online dating context. Results show that the CaF framework effectively resolves privacy–perception trade-off problems by preserving the information that is useful for humans to make inferences about many relevant perceptual dimensions in marketing while making it virtually impossible for humans to infer identity and very difficult to infer age and gender accurately—two critical discrimination factors. Results from the field implementation demonstrate the feasibility and value of using the CaF framework for real-life decision making.","Yinghui Zhou, Shasha Lu, Min Ding","facial contour, face perception, facial privacy, Fourier transformation, online dating",15
Free Shipping Promotions and Product Returns,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720921812,08-May-20,01-Aug-20,57,4,640,658,"Free shipping promotions have become popular among online retailers. However, little is known about their influence on consumers’ purchases, return behavior, and, ultimately, firm profit. The authors propose that free shipping promotions encourage customers to make riskier purchases, leading to more product returns. They estimate the impact of these promotions on purchase incidence, high-risk and low-risk spend, and return share. The results show that free shipping promotions increase expenditure for high-risk products, expanding their share of the consumer’s market basket and thus increasing the overall return rate. This is validated in a field experiment. A field test and an online lab experiment analyze the mechanism linking free shipping and returns. The results suggest that the free shipping effect occurs through consumers’ perceptions that free shipping serves as a risk premium compensating them for potential returns and through positive affect generated by the promotion. A simulation shows that for the focal firm, free shipping promotions increase net sales volume, but higher product returns and lost shipping revenue render these promotions unprofitable.","Edlira Shehu, Dominik Papies, Scott A.

Integration of Primary and Resale Platforms,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720917352,04-May-20,01-Aug-20,57,4,659,676,"Consumers can buy concert tickets from primary platforms (e.g., Ticketmaster) or from consumer-to-consumer resale platforms (e.g., StubHub). Recently, Ticketmaster has entered and been trying to control the resale market by prohibiting consumers from reselling on competing resale platforms. Several states in the United States have passed or are discussing laws requiring tickets to be transferrable on any resale sites, worrying that platform integration—Ticketmaster controlling both the primary and the resale platforms—will increase ticket service fees and harm musicians and consumers. This article establishes a game-theoretic framework and shows that the opposite can happen: platform integration can lower the service fees in both markets, alleviating double marginalization in the primary market and benefiting the musician and consumers. Moreover, with platform integration, the presence of a small number of scalpers can counterintuitively reduce the ticket price and benefit the musicians and consumers. In addition, platform competition in the resale market may harm consumers. This article further shows that these insights apply in other markets (e.g. used goods, peer-to-peer product-sharing markets) and provides suggestive empirical support for the theoretical results.","Tianxin Zou, Baojun Jiang","antitrust, channel coordination, consumer welfare, event ticket, platform, regulation, resale, secondary market",1

The present research explores two mechanisms that manufacturers use to address this challenge: training and incentives (spiffs). The authors find that the impact of these mechanisms on distributor salespeople’s efforts (toward a manufacturer’s products) largely depends on the extent to which manufacturers also provide training and incentives to distributor sales managers. More specifically, providing greater incentives to distributor sales managers undermines the relationship between their salespeople’s training and effort but enhances the relationship between their salespeople’s incentives and effort. Furthermore, greater sales manager training enhances the impact of salespeople’s incentives on effort; however, greater salesperson training undermines the relationship between salesperson incentives and effort. Thus, this research shows that the combination of mechanisms (training and incentives) and the levels at which manufacturers provide them (distributor salespeople and sales managers) can have different implications for distributor salespeople’s efforts.","Sarah Magnotta, Brian Murtha, Goutam Challagalla","effort, incentive dilemma, incentives, legitimacy, sales managers, spiffs, training, training transfer",13

Hiding Gifts Behind the Veil of Vouchers: On the Effect of Gift Vouchers Versus Direct Gifts in Conditional Promotions,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720916753,27-Apr-20,01-Aug-20,57,4,739,754,"To boost sales, marketers often conduct promotions that offer gifts conditional on the purchase of a focal product. Such promotions can present gifts in different formats: customers could be informed that they will receive a gift directly or that they will receive a voucher entitling them to a gift. Normatively speaking, the two formats are equivalent, as a voucher’s value is identical to that of the gift it represents. Yet this article suggests that promotion format (voucher vs. direct gift) influences consumers’ intention to purchase the focal product. Five lab experiments and one field experiment reveal that, compared with presenting a gift directly, introducing a voucher attenuates the influence of gift value on purchase decisions, decreasing purchase intentions for promotions offering high-value gifts but increasing purchase intentions for promotions offering low-value gifts. This effect occurs because vouchers break the direct association between the focal product and the gift, reducing people’s tendency to compare the gift’s value with the focal product’s value. The effect observed can be attenuated by increasing the salience of gift value.","Yu Ding, Yan Zhang","comparison tendency, conditional promotion, decoupling, free gift, purchase intention, voucher",3
Lowering the Minimum Donation Amount Increases Consumer Purchase Likelihood of Products Associated with Cause-Related Marketing Campaigns,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720916463,28-Apr-20,01-Aug-20,57,4,755,770,"Both the total amount to be donated and the way it is communicated can influence consumer reactions to cause-related marketing (CM) campaigns. While companies often choose not to explicate any donation limit, this study argues that donation frames (e.g., minimum or maximum total donation) can enhance the likelihood of consumer purchases associated with CM campaigns. In a series of four studies, the authors find that consumers often respond more favorably to minimum-frame CM campaigns with a relatively low donation amount (e.g., at least $100,000 will be donated) than those with a high donation amount (e.g., at least $10 million will be donated) despite the superiority of the latter for the recipient cause. This effect is inverted for maximum donation frames, such that a high donation amount leads to greater consumer participation. This research also demonstrates that this effect is driven by the consumer desire to make a personal contribution to a cause, which is more likely to be observed when consumers endow it with high importance. These effects are obtained with attitudes, behavioral intentions, and actual expenditures.","Michael Tsiros, Caglar Irmak","cause-related marketing, donation, framing, minimum-maximum, personal contribution",11
The Left-Digit Bias: When and Why Are Consumers Penny Wise and Pound Foolish?,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720932532,17-Jun-20,01-Aug-20,57,4,771,788,"Consumers’ price evaluations are influenced by the left-digit bias, wherein consumers judge the difference between $4.00 and $2.99 to be larger than that between $4.01 and $3.00, even though the numeric differences are identical.

The authors propose that the left-digit bias is stronger in stimulus-based price evaluations, wherein people see the focal price and the reference price side by side, and weaker in memory-based price evaluations, wherein people have to retrieve at least one price from memory. This is because in stimulus-based price evaluations, people tend to rely on perceptual representations of prices without rounding them. In memory-based price evaluations, they rely more on conceptual representations, which makes them more likely to round the prices. Results from six studies—five experiments and a scanner panel study—support the hypothesis that the left-digit bias is stronger in stimulus-based evaluations.

On the other hand, receiving inbound links can increase a linked site’s audience by informing readers about its news content that day. To explore these opposing perspectives, the authors develop a dynamic learning model and fit it to browsing and link data from celebrity news sites. They then simulate how banning links affects consumer browsing and find that linking increases celebrity news consumption, especially among consumers who browse the least. On average, linking benefits both the linking and linked sites. The authors estimate that exposure to a link increases the likelihood of visiting the linked site by .14%.

The authors find that, on average, participants are able to partially realize the long-term benefits from loyalty programs, though most are sensitive to price. They also find that participants’ preferences and levels of bounded rationality depend on the nature of the competitive environment, the particular state of each decision scenario, and the type of optimal action. Accordingly, the authors use an approximate dynamic programming model to incorporate boundedly rational decision making. The model classifies participants into five segments that exhibit variation in their performance and decision strategies. Importantly, they find that participants are able to adapt their decision strategies to the environment they face, and thus the overall market outcome and the performance of each firm are influenced by both the competitive environment and the assumption on the extent of consumer optimality.","Jia Liu, Asim Ansari","approximate dynamic programming, bounded rationality, competition, experiments, loyalty programs, promotions",10
Advertising Effectiveness for Multiple Retailer-Brands in a Multimedia and Multichannel Environment,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720910104,08-Apr-20,01-Jun-20,57,3,445,467,"An important aspect of multimedia advertising effectiveness that remains unexplored is a customer-level analysis of the relative importance of each medium for multiple retailer-brands within a product category. The increasing availability of customer databases for parent companies containing multimedia ad exposures, sales transactions in several purchase channels, and information across multiple retailer-brands now allows for a broader examination of advertising effectiveness. In this research, the authors monitor 4,000 customers over two years, linking their exposure to three media (email, catalogs, and paid search) to their in-store and online purchases for three retailer-brands in the clothing category. They develop a Tobit model for sales response to multimedia advertising that captures within-brand and within-channel correlations and accommodates individual-level advertising response parameters. Due to the very large number of observations (2.4 million) and random effects (60), the authors employ an emerging machine learning technique, variational Bayes, to estimate the model parameters. They find that email and sometimes catalogs from a focal retailer-brand have a negative influence on other retailer-brands in the category, whereas paid search influences only the focal retailer-brand. However, competitor catalogs often positively influence focal retailer-brand sales, but only among omnichannel customers.

Applying this methodology to sales and advertising data across eight brands from three categories substantiates for the first time, and uniformly across all brands, that managers depart from optimality through adaptive experimentation, which is in line with dual control theory that suggests they do so to learn about advertising effectiveness. The adaptive experimentation finding, combined with evidence on the use of heuristic methods, suggests that budget decision making is characterized by bounded rationality. Furthermore, budgeting decisions are brand-specific, reflecting the considerations of a brand’s market position and performance. Finally, simulation studies show that brands from categories with high uncertainty in advertising effectiveness can benefit from double-digit revenue lifts by placing higher emphasis on adaptive experimentation.","Ceren Kolsarici, Demetrios Vakratsas, Prasad A.

The authors also show that impairing process simulation and high skepticism moderate the ad-type effect (Studies 4–5). Finally, they show effect reversals: if consumers focus on achieving the desired results quickly, and it is possible to do so, progression ads and the associated process simulation backfire in terms of credibility and persuasion (Studies 6–7).

This sequence of effects is particularly pronounced when consumers do not have a strong prior preference for specific alternatives in the assortment. Evidence from five studies, including a large-scale field experiment, provides support for this theorizing across various display formats and product domains.

Two field studies and five online experiments provide evidence that the personality trait of buying impulsivity predicts differences in whether a shopper initially focuses on internal motivations (e.g., “because I love it”) or external motivations (e.g., “because it is on sale”) for unplanned purchases at the beginning of a shopping trip and, consistent with a mechanism of motivation balancing, that motivations for unplanned purchases change as a shopper satisfies their initial motivations. The studies also demonstrate how the level of buying impulsivity influences the effectiveness of point-of-purchase messages at stimulating unplanned purchases and consumers’ relative spending on unplanned purchases.

Toward a Process-Transfer Model of the Endorser Effect,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720910453,15-Apr-20,01-Jun-20,57,3,565,581,"Previous research on the effects of celebrity endorsement has focused on the transfer of positive properties (likeableness, credibility, symbolic meanings, etc.) from the endorser to the product. Taking a different perspective, this study suggests that the way in which consumers evaluate an endorser (i.e., the cognitive process, such as applying family origin or achievement as the basis for evaluation) will carry over to the evaluation of the endorsed product (e.g., applying country of origin or performance as the criteria). Five experiments support this process-transfer account and show that it can be induced by subtle verbal/visual cues in advertisements. Because the process transfer is not inherently associated with positive/negative valence, it provides a theoretical rationale for explaining successful endorsements involving endorsers who are less favorable/credible, less of a “fit” with the product, or associated with some negative meanings, in addition to those involving positively or neutrally evaluated endorsers. The process-transfer model supplements existing models and provides a more comprehensive understanding of endorser effects. It provides marketers with a set of less stringent guidelines for selecting endorsers as well as valuable damage control tools for brands when an endorser screws up.","Vincent Chi Wong, Henry Fock, Candy K.Y.

Fear of Detection and Efficacy of Prevention: Using Construal Level to Encourage Health Behaviors,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243720912443,22-Apr-20,01-Jun-20,57,3,582,598,"This research examines the psychological processes and factors that shape illness-detection versus illness-prevention health actions. Four experiments using contexts of mental health, skin cancer, and breast cancer show that illness detection evokes fear, which undermines engagement in detection behaviors. Considering detection at low (vs. high) levels of thought reduced fear and increased health persuasion. Illness prevention is driven by self-efficacy perceptions and considering prevention at high (vs. low) levels of thought increases persuasion. In further evidence of process, trait fear moderated the detection effects, and dispositional self-efficacy moderated the prevention effects. As an intervention, framing a detection action as serving illness-prevention goals increased people’s likelihood of engaging with an online breast cancer detection tool. These findings illuminate the psychology of detection as being distinct from the psychology of prevention, identify the role of fear in the consideration of health behaviors, and show contexts in which construal levels have divergent effects on health persuasion.","Chethana Achar, Nidhi Agrawal, Meng-Hua Hsieh","construal level theory, detection health behaviors, fear, health messaging",1
Nonprofit Versus For-Profit Health Care Competition: How Service Mix Makes Nonprofit Hospitals More Profitable,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719901169,05-Mar-20,01-Apr-20,57,2,193,210,"This article studies the intersection between the largest U.S. industry—health care—and the $1 trillion nonprofit sector. Using analytical and empirical analyses, the authors reveal the marketing strategies helping private nonprofit hospitals achieve higher output, prices, and profits than for-profit hospitals. Nonprofit hospitals, focusing on both profits and output, obtain these outcomes by expanding their service mix with high-priced premium specialty medical services (PSMS), whereas for-profit hospitals can be more profitable with higher prices for basic services. Competition increases the differences between nonprofit and for-profit hospitals in PSMS breadth, output, and prices. Nonprofit hospitals lose their competitive advantage when competing with other nonprofits; that is, presence of a for-profit competitor broadens available nonprofit PSMS. With broader service mixes, nonprofits focus more on national advertising than for-profits because PSMS (e.g., pediatric trauma, neurosurgery, heart transplants, oncology) require larger geographic markets than local basic services (e.g., laboratory, diagnostics, nursing, pharmaceutics). Exogenous, heterogeneous state regulations restricting for-profit hospital entry help econometric identification (i.e., markets prohibiting for-profits act as controls).

"Multiperiod Contracting and Salesperson Effort Profiles: The Optimality of “Hockey Stick,” “Giving Up,” and “Resting on Laurels”",https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719887378,11-Feb-20,01-Apr-20,57,2,211,235,"The authors study multiperiod sales force incentive contracting in which salespeople can engage in effort gaming, a phenomenon that has extensive empirical support. Focusing on a repeated moral hazard scenario with two independent periods and a risk-neutral agent with limited liability, the authors conduct a theoretical investigation to understand which effort profiles the firm can expect under the optimal contract. The authors show that various effort profiles that may give the appearance of being suboptimal, such as postponing effort exertion (“hockey stick”) and not exerting effort after a bad or a good initial demand outcome (“giving up” and “resting on laurels,” respectively) may indeed be induced optimally by the firm. This is because, under certain conditions that depend on how severe the contracting frictions are and how effective effort exertion is in increasing demand, the firm wants to concentrate rewards on extreme demand outcomes. Doing this induces gaming and reduces expected demand but also makes motivating effort cheaper, thus saving on incentive payments. On introducing dependence between time periods, such as when the agent can transfer demands between periods, this insight continues to hold and, furthermore, “hockey stick,” “giving up,” and “resting on laurels” can be optimal for the firm even under repeated short time horizon contracting. The results imply that one must carefully consider the setting and environmental factors when making inferences about contract effectiveness from dynamic effort profiles of agents.","Kinshuk Jerath, Fei Long","sales force compensation, dynamic incentives, effort gaming, “hockey stick,” sales push out and pull in",1
Communicating Brands in Television Advertising,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719892576,13-Feb-20,01-Apr-20,57,2,236,256,"Many studies have quantified the effects of TV ad spending or gross rating points on brand sales. Yet this effect is likely moderated by the different types of brand-related messages or cues (e.g., logo, brand attributes) embedded in the ads and by the ways (e.g., explicitly or implicitly) these cues are conveyed to TV audiences. The authors thus measure 17 cues often used within ads to build brand awareness (or salience) and brand image and investigate their influence on ad effectiveness. Technically, the study builds a dynamic model to quantify the effects of advertising on sales; builds a robust and interpretable (i.e., nonparametric and sparse) factor model that integrates correlated, left-censored branding cues; and then models the effects of advertising as a function of the factors identified by these cues. An analysis of 177 campaigns aired by 62 brands finds that salience cues (e.g., logo) and benefit and attribute messages moderate ad effectiveness. It also finds that explicit cues are more effective than implicit ones; nonetheless, the primary drivers of ad effectiveness are visual salience cues: the duration and frequency with which the logo and the duration with which the product are displayed. The study can thus suggest ways brand and ad agency managers can improve the effects of creative ad content on sales.","Norris I.

Specifically, it investigates the role of two key strategic visual design decisions: brand typicality (similarity within the brand’s range) and segment typicality (similarity to the competitive set). Drawing on fluency theory, the authors argue that high-equity brands benefit more from brand typicality but less from segment typicality than low-equity brands.

Service Providers’ Decision to Use Ethics Committees and Consultation in Complex Services,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719898495,11-Feb-20,01-Apr-20,57,2,278,297,"Ethics has long been, and continues to be, a central topic among marketing scholars and practitioners.

Despite the prevalence of ECs, research on service providers’ preference to engage with an EC is sparse. This study examines whether the role that health care providers play, as either task manager or relationship manager, makes a difference in their preference for engaging with and utilizing an EC for resolving ethical dilemmas. Results based on 1,440 observations collected from health care service providers show that service providers’ task or relationship management role, as well as prior experience with an ethics consultation, influences their preference both for engaging an EC and for having the EC prescribe a specific outcome to resolve an ethical dilemma.

Inaction Traps in Consumer Response to Product Malfunctions,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719889336,20-Jan-20,01-Apr-20,57,2,298,314,"The authors develop and test a theory of consumer inaction traps in the domain of decisions to either address or endure product malfunctions. According to this theory, the magnitude of product malfunctions can have a paradoxical effect on consumption experience. In particular, the less severe a product malfunction is, the more inclined consumers are to defer the initial decision about whether to take corrective action. Subsequent opportunities for corrective action are devalued relative to previously forgone ones. This dynamic tends to trap consumers in a state of inaction, resulting in their enduring smaller malfunctions longer than larger ones. A consequence of these inaction traps is that minor product malfunctions may result in less enjoyable overall consumption experiences than more severe defects. Evidence from eight experiments and a survey provides support for this theorizing by demonstrating the inaction-trap phenomenon, examining its downstream consequences, shedding light on the psychological dynamics of inaction, and identifying boundary conditions that suggest interventions for counteracting consumers’ vulnerability to suffering disproportionately from relatively minor product malfunctions.","Neil Brigden, Gerald Häubl","consumer inaction, consumption experience, decision dynamics, enjoyment, product malfunctions",0

Through six studies, the authors show that scented ads enhance consumers’ sense of proximity of the advertised product and consequently increase product appeal. In line with the proposed visceral nature of the effect, this effect holds even for unpleasant scents but is contingent on the scent’s ability to represent the advertised product. The effect is weakened when the product is physically close.

The Enhancing Versus Backfiring Effects of Positive Emotion in Consumer Reviews,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719892594,07-Feb-20,01-Apr-20,57,2,332,352,"Researchers, marketers, and consumers often believe that amplifying emotional content is impactful for the spread of information and purchasing decisions. However, there is little systematic investigation of when emotionality backfires. This research demonstrates when and why positive emotion can have enhancing versus backfiring effects.

In addition, expressed emotion for hedonic products has a positive impact when read by others, but this emotion backfires for utilitarian products, leading others to be less positive. The authors construct a conceptual model of these effects and show that violated expectations leading to decreased trust underlie this divergence between reviewers and readers. The effects occur in well-controlled experiments as well as computational linguistic analysis of 100,000 Amazon reviews across 500 products. Indeed, emotional reviews of utilitarian products are less likely to become popular and be displayed on the product’s front page on Amazon.

In a series of online and field experiments, the authors demonstrate that the interpretation and persuasiveness of consensus language depends on the tie strength between the communicator and the receiver of WOM. Although abundant literature highlights the advantage of strong ties (e.g., close friends, family) in influence and persuasion, the authors find that weak ties (e.g., distant friends, acquaintances) are more influential than strong ties when using consensus language. The authors theorize and demonstrate that this effect occurs because weak ties evoke perceptions of a larger and more diverse group in consensus, which signals greater validity for the issue at hand.

Advertisers face a trade-off between ad clicks and brand recognition, whereas publishers need to strike a balance between ad clicks and the platform’s trustworthiness. For policy makers, concerns that native advertising confuses customers prompted the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to issue guidelines for disclosing native ads. This research aims to understand how consumers respond to native ads versus display ads and to different styles of native ad disclosures, using randomized online and field experiments combining behavioral clickstream, eye movement, and survey response data. The results show that when the position of an ad on a news page is controlled for, a native ad generates a higher click-through rate because it better resembles the surrounding editorial content.

A Multiattribute Benefits-Based Choice Model with Multiple Mediators: New Insights for Positioning,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719881618,13-Nov-19,01-Feb-20,57,1,35,54,"Previous research has demonstrated that consumers evaluate products according to their perceived benefits when making a choice. This article extends prior work by proposing a method that evaluates the degree to which multiple a priori defined benefits mediate product choices. The model is the first to consider process heterogeneity—that is, heterogeneity in how consumers perceive multiple attributes to positively or negatively affect multiple benefits simultaneously and the contribution of each benefit to product utility. The authors propose discrete choice experiments to holistically measure the link between attributes and benefits, as well as between attributes and choice, resulting in data that can be analyzed with a generalized probit model. The approach contributes to mediation research by offering an alternative method of handling multiple multinomial mediators and dichotomous outcome variables. An empirical illustration of bread choices shows how consumer judgments about health and value perceptions of products mediate purchase decisions. The authors demonstrate how the method can help managers (1) confirm and test existing knowledge about latent benefits, including whether they explain all the variation in choice, and (2) consider process heterogeneity to inform market segmentation strategies.","Paul F.

While much of the literature focuses on capturing static cross-sectional heterogeneity, little research has been done on modeling dynamic heterogeneity, or the heterogeneous evolution of individual-level model parameters. In this work, the authors propose a novel framework for capturing the dynamics of heterogeneity, using individual-level, latent, Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian processes. Similar to standard heterogeneity specifications, this Gaussian process dynamic heterogeneity (GPDH) specification models individual-level parameters as flexible variations around population-level trends, allowing for sharing of statistical information both across individuals and within individuals over time. This hierarchical structure provides precise individual-level insights regarding parameter dynamics. The authors show that GPDH nests existing heterogeneity specifications and that not flexibly capturing individual-level dynamics may result in biased parameter estimates. Substantively, they apply GPDH to understand preference dynamics and to model the evolution of online reviews. Across both applications, they find robust evidence of dynamic heterogeneity and illustrate GPDH’s rich managerial insights, with implications for targeting, pricing, and market structure analysis.","Ryan Dew, Asim Ansari, Yang Li","Bayesian nonparametrics, choice models, dynamics, Gaussian processes, heterogeneity, machine learning, topic models",34
Transparency of Behavior-Based Pricing,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719881448,19-Nov-19,01-Feb-20,57,1,78,99,"Behavior-based pricing (BBP) refers to the practice in which firms collect consumers’ purchase history data, recognize repeat and new consumers from the data, and offer them different prices. This is a prevalent practice for firms and a worldwide concern for consumers. Extant research has examined BBP under the assumption that consumers observe firms’ practice of BBP. However, consumers do not know that specific firms are doing this and are often unaware of how firms collect and use their data. In this article, the authors examine (1) how firms make BBP decisions when consumers do not observe whether firms perform BBP and (2) how the transparency of firms’ BBP practice affects firms and consumers. They find that when consumers do not observe firms’ practice of BBP and the cost of implementing BBP is low, a firm indeed practices BBP, even though BBP is a dominated strategy when consumers observe it. When the cost is moderate, the firm does not use BBP; however, it must distort its first-period price downward to signal and convince consumers of its choice. A high cost of implementing BBP serves as a commitment device that the firm will forfeit BBP, thereby improving firm profit. By comparing regimes in which consumers do and do not observe a firm’s practice of BBP, the authors find that transparency of BBP increases firm profit but decreases consumer surplus and social welfare. Therefore, requiring firms to disclose collection and usage of consumer data could hurt consumers and lead to unintended consequences.","Xi Li, Krista J.

The present research shows that, yes, consumers respond more positively to nongraspable products if a haptic cue (an object that is graspable or suggestive of hand action) is located within the same visual field as the target and is positioned to appeal to the viewer’s dominant hand. This result is driven by the creation and transfer of perceived ownership from cue to target. These findings extend the use of haptic cues to nongraspable products and uncover the critical role played by perceived ownership, including its ability to transfer from one object to another located in the same visual field.

Five subsequent experiments test a process account for this effect, identifying two key psychological mechanisms: reputational benefits and action costs. First, at the referral stage, senders (existing customers) anticipate reputational benefits for referring recipients (potential new customers), who receive a reward for signing up. These reputational benefits render recipient-benefiting referrals just as effective as sender-benefiting referrals at the relatively low-cost referral stage. Second, at the uptake stage, recipient-benefiting referrals are more effective than sender-benefiting referrals: recipient-benefiting referrals directly incentivize recipients to sign up, providing a clear reward for an otherwise costly uptake decision. The preponderance of selfish, or sender-benefiting, referral incentives in the marketplace suggests these effects are unanticipated by marketers who design incentive schemes.","Rachel Gershon, Cynthia Cryder, Leslie K.

These identities may be associated with similar behavioral norms such that a female identity and a local identity are associated with the norms of small groups and intimate relationships, whereas a male identity and a global identity are associated with the norms of large groups and broad relationships. Thus, a female identity and a global (vs. local) identity, as is the case with a male identity and a local (vs. global) identity, results in identity incongruence (vs. congruence). The authors argue that identity incongruence depletes cognitive resources and induces affective processing, which in turn activates a sacrifice mindset and results in lower price sensitivity. Five studies with different research designs, divergent measures of key constructs, and diverse samples support the theories and identify boundary conditions of the focal relationship. The findings expand the literature on multiple consumer identities and price sensitivity and provide useful guidelines for global companies’ pricing strategies.","Huachao Gao, Vikas Mittal, Yinlong Zhang","gender identity, local–global identity, identity incongruence, price sensitivity, sacrifice mindset",0

During the debates, users acted akin to narrators, posting shorter tweets that commented on unfolding events, with linguistic emotionality playing a limited role in sharing.

Second, the authors quantify the causal impact of read-review content on sales by using supervised deep learning to tag six theory-driven content dimensions and applying a regression discontinuity in time design. They find that aesthetics and price content significantly increase conversion across almost all product categories. Review content has a higher impact on sales when the average rating is higher, ratings variance is lower, the market is more competitive or immature, or brand information is not accessible. A counterfactual simulation suggests that reordering reviews based on content can have the same effect as a 1.6% price cut for boosting conversion.","Xiao Liu, Dokyun Lee, Kannan Srinivasan","consumer purchase journey, deep learning, economic impact of text, product reviews, natural language processing, regression discontinuity in time",0
The Impact of Increasing Search Frictions on Online Shopping Behavior: Evidence from a Field Experiment,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719865516,22-Sep-19,01-Dec-19,56,6,944,959,"Many online stores are designed such that shoppers can easily access any available discounted products. The authors propose that deliberately increasing search frictions by placing obstacles to locating discounted items can improve online retailers’ margins and even increase conversion. The authors demonstrate this using a simple theoretical framework that suggests inducing consumers to inspect higher-priced items first may simultaneously increase the average price of items sold and the overall expected purchase probability by inducing consumers to search more products. The authors test and confirm these predictions in a series of field experiments conducted with a dominant online fashion and apparel retailer. Furthermore, using information in historical transaction data about each consumer, the authors demonstrate that price-sensitive shoppers are more likely to willingly incur search costs when locating discounted items. Our results show that increasing search frictions can be used as a self-selecting price discrimination tool to match high discounts with price-sensitive consumers and full-priced offerings with price-insensitive consumers.","Donald Ngwe, Kris Johnson Ferreira, Thales Teixeira","e-commerce, friction, online retailing, price discrimination, search costs",3
When Words Sweat: Identifying Signals for Loan Default in the Text of Loan Applications,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719852959,15-Aug-19,01-Dec-19,56,6,960,980,"The authors present empirical evidence that borrowers, consciously or not, leave traces of their intentions, circumstances, and personality traits in the text they write when applying for a loan. This textual information has a substantial and significant ability to predict whether borrowers will pay back the loan above and beyond the financial and demographic variables commonly used in models predicting default. The authors use text-mining and machine learning tools to automatically process and analyze the raw text in over 120,000 loan requests from Prosper, an online crowdfunding platform. Including in the predictive model the textual information in the loan significantly helps predict loan default and can have substantial financial implications. The authors find that loan requests written by defaulting borrowers are more likely to include words related to their family, mentions of God, the borrower’s financial and general hardship, pleading lenders for help, and short-term-focused words. The authors further observe that defaulting loan requests are written in a manner consistent with the writing styles of extroverts and liars.","Oded Netzer, Alain Lemaire, Michal Herzenstein","consumer finance, loan default, machine learning, text mining",3
Measuring Rank-Based Utility in Contests: The Effect of Disclosure Schemes,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719853289,25-Aug-19,01-Dec-19,56,6,981,994,"This article studies how the incentive structures and disclosure schemes of a contest affect the contestants’ intrinsic motivations. Specifically, the authors measure the effects of these design decisions on two types of nonmonetary rank-based utility: self-generated and peer-induced. They run a set of laboratory experiments involving contests under various reward spreads and disclosure schemes. First, they find that virtually all commonly adopted disclosure schemes generate positive peer-induced rank-based utility. However, the relative performances of alternative disclosure schemes can depend on the spread of contest rewards and the number of contestants. Second, being recognized as a winner confers positive peer-induced rank-based utility; moreover, being recognized as the sole first-place winner or as one among multiple winners does not produce significantly different peer-induced utility. Third, “shaming” by disclosing the identity of contestants ranked at the bottom leads to negative peer-induced rank-based utility, but the effect is marginally insignificant. Finally, a smaller spread of contest rewards consistently results in higher levels of self-generated rank-based utility. These results underscore the importance of jointly choosing incentive structures and disclosure schemes.","Tanjim Hossain, Mengze Shi, Robert Waiser","rank-based utility, recognition, sales contests, lab experiments",0
Media Coverage of Climate Change and Sustainable Product Consumption: Evidence from the Hybrid Vehicle Market,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719865898,12-Sep-19,01-Dec-19,56,6,995,1011,"As sustainable consumption becomes increasingly important, firms must better understand the drivers behind the consumption of these products. This article examines the effects of mass media in the context of the U.S. hybrid vehicle market. Drawing on monthly sales data, the authors provide evidence that the general coverage of climate change or global warming by major media outlets exerts an overall positive impact on the sales of hybrid vehicles. This impact mainly comes from the media reports that assert that climate change is occurring. In contrast, media coverage that either denies climate change or holds a neutral stance on the issue has little impact. The authors provide preliminary evidence that a social norm advocating for environmentally friendly consumption plays an important role in how media coverage affects consumer purchase.

However, recent research suggests that CP is beneficial to both customers and firms. The literature is also sparse on the economic (e.g., profitability) and customer (e.g., customer retention) impact of CP. This research introduces the concept of customer empowerment and develops and tests a model of customer empowerment as a parallel mediator, along with customer satisfaction, to explain the linkage between CP and bank branch performance. Furthermore, the authors draw on a broader set of moderators beyond customer characteristics to examine when CP affects empowerment and satisfaction. Using triadic matched data from a multiwave design and a three-level model in which customers are nested within employees, who are, in turn, nested within bank branches, the authors show that customer empowerment and satisfaction fully mediate the effect of CP on branch performance. The findings also show that CP results in greater customer empowerment and satisfaction when there is fit between participation and the context in which it is used.

Second, a series of comparisons reveal that households in harbinger zip codes make other decisions that differ from other households. The first comparison identifies harbinger zip codes using purchases from one retailer and then evaluates purchases at a different retailer. Households in harbinger zip codes purchase products from the second retailer that other households are less likely to purchase. The analysis next compares donations to congressional election candidates; households in harbinger zip codes donate to different candidates than households in neighboring zip codes, and they donate to candidates who are less likely to win. House prices in harbinger zip codes also increase at slower rates than in neighboring zip codes. Investigation of households that change zip codes indicates that the harbinger zip code effect is more due to where customers choose to live, rather than households influencing their neighbors’ tendencies.","Duncan I.

Personalizing the Customization Experience: A Matching Theory of Mass Customization Interfaces and Cultural Information Processing,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719867698,09-Oct-19,01-Dec-19,56,6,1050,1065,"Mass customization interfaces typically guide consumers through the configuration process in a sequential manner, focusing on one product attribute after the other. What if this standardized customization experience were personalized for consumers on the basis of how they process information? A series of large-scale field and experimental studies, conducted with Western and Eastern consumers, shows that matching the interface to consumers’ culture-specific processing style enhances the effectiveness of mass customization. Specifically, presenting the same information isolated (by attribute) to Western consumers but contextualized (by alternative) to Eastern consumers increases satisfaction with and likelihood of purchasing the configured product, along with the amount of money spent on the product. These positive consumer responses emerge because of an increase in “interface fluency”—consumers’ subjective experience of ease when using the interface.

Competition of Content Acquisition and Distribution Under Consumer Multipurchase,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719870803,26-Sep-19,01-Dec-19,56,6,1066,1084,"In many markets, such as video streaming or information services, a consumer may purchase multiple competing products or services. The existing theoretical literature typically assumes that each consumer can buy only one product. This article explicitly models the consumer’s multipurchase behavior and examines an upstream content creator’s content production and selling strategies as well as competing downstream distributors’ content acquisition and pricing strategies. The authors find that in contrast to the case of single-product purchase, under multiproduct purchase, only one distributor will acquire the creator’s new content in equilibrium. Furthermore, when the content distributors are not highly differentiated (each having a limited amount of unique content), the content creator will reduce new content production, leading to lower profits for both the content creator and the content distributors. By contrast, when the distributors are already highly differentiated with a substantial amount of unique content, the content creator will increase its content production, leading to higher profits for both the content creator and the distributors. The authors show that their main results and insights are robust to several alternative assumptions.","Baojun Jiang, Lin Tian, Bo Zhou","content creation, differentiation, multihoming, multiproduct purchase, pricing",0

By linking the actual purchase and conjoint data, researchers can estimate preferences for attributes not yet present in the marketplace, while also addressing many of the key limitations of conjoint analysis, including sample selection and contextual differences.

Using a difference-in-differences approach, the authors show that online store sales increased, on average, by 1.45% per business-day reduction in delivery time, from a baseline of seven business days. The authors also find a positive spillover effect to the retailer’s offline stores. These effects increase gradually in the short-to-medium run as the result of higher order count. The authors identify two main drivers of the observed effect: (1) customer learning through service interactions with the retailer and (2) existing brand presence in terms of online store penetration rate and offline store presence. Customers with less online store experience are more responsive to faster deliveries in the short run, whereas experienced online store customers are more responsive in the long run.","Marshall L.

When Salespeople Manage Customer Relationships: Multidimensional Incentives and Private Information,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719847661,03-Jul-19,01-Oct-19,56,5,749,766,"At many firms, incentivized salespeople with private information about customers are responsible for customer relationship management. Although incentives motivate sales performance, private information can induce moral hazard by salespeople to gain compensation at the expense of the firm. The authors investigate the sales performance–moral hazard trade-off in response to multidimensional performance (acquisition and maintenance) incentives in the presence of private information. Using unique panel data on customer loan acquisition and repayments linked to salespeople from a microfinance bank, the authors detect evidence of salesperson private information. Acquisition incentives induce salesperson moral hazard, leading to adverse customer selection, but maintenance incentives moderate it as salespeople recognize the negative effects of acquiring low-quality customers on future payoffs. Critically, without the moderating effect of maintenance incentives, the adverse selection effect of acquisition incentives overwhelms the sales-enhancing effects, clarifying the importance of multidimensional incentives for customer relationship management. Reducing private information (through job transfers) hurts customer maintenance but has greater impact on productivity by moderating adverse selection at acquisition. This article also contributes to the recent literature on detecting and disentangling customer adverse selection and customer moral hazard (defaults) with a new identification strategy that exploits the time-varying effects of salesperson incentives.","Minkyung Kim, K.

The Charm of Behavior-Based Pricing: When Consumers’ Taste Is Diverse and the Consideration Set Is Limited,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719834945,03-Jul-19,01-Oct-19,56,5,767,790,"Technology is making it easier for firms to track consumers’ purchase history and leverage the information when setting prices. This article explores the practice of behavior-based pricing (BBP) in a horizontally differentiated market where consumers’ taste is diverse and the consideration set is limited. The analysis identifies a novel mechanism that can help firms earn more profits with BBP than without it. Prior research shows that BBP intensifies price competition for new consumers. The authors show that if consumer valuation is low, the lower price can help expand sales to consumers for whom only the second preferred product is available, and the resulting increase in revenue more than offsets the loss in revenue because of the intensified price competition. The opposite result occurs if product valuation is high. Moreover, the difference in the price charged for old and new consumers under BBP decreases with the diversity in consumers’ taste if consumer valuation is low. The result, however, is reversed if consumer valuation is high.","Wilfred Amaldoss, Chuan He","behavior-based pricing, game theory, product availability, spokes model",0
In Mobile We Trust: The Effects of Mobile Versus Nonmobile Reviews on Consumer Purchase Intentions,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719834514,09-Jun-19,01-Oct-19,56,5,791,808,"In the context of user-generated content (UGC), mobile devices have made it easier for consumers to review products and services in a timely manner. In practice, some UGC sites indicate if a review was posted from a mobile device. For example, TripAdvisor uses a “via mobile” label to denote reviews from mobile devices. However, the extent to which such information affects consumers is unknown. To address this gap, the authors use TripAdvisor data and five experiments to examine how mobile devices influence consumers’ perceptions of online reviews and their purchase intentions. They find that knowing a review was posted from a mobile device can lead consumers to have higher purchase intentions. Interestingly, this is due to a process in which consumers assume mobile reviews are more physically effortful to craft and subsequently equate this greater perceived effort with the credibility of the review.","Lauren Grewal, Andrew T.

Task-Dependent Algorithm Aversion,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719851788,15-Jul-19,01-Oct-19,56,5,809,825,"Research suggests that consumers are averse to relying on algorithms to perform tasks that are typically done by humans, despite the fact that algorithms often perform better. The authors explore when and why this is true in a wide variety of domains. They find that algorithms are trusted and relied on less for tasks that seem subjective (vs. objective) in nature. However, they show that perceived task objectivity is malleable and that increasing a task’s perceived objectivity increases trust in and use of algorithms for that task. Consumers mistakenly believe that algorithms lack the abilities required to perform subjective tasks. Increasing algorithms’ perceived affective human-likeness is therefore effective at increasing the use of algorithms for subjective tasks. These findings are supported by the results of four online lab studies with over 1,400 participants and two online field studies with over 56,000 participants. The results provide insights into when and why consumers are likely to use algorithms and how marketers can increase their use when they outperform humans.","Noah Castelo, Maarten W. Bos, Donald R.

When “More” Seems Like Less: Differential Price Framing Increases the Choice Share of Higher-Priced Options,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719851490,11-Jul-19,01-Oct-19,56,5,826,841,"Four experiments supported by six supplemental studies show that premium but higher-priced products (e.g., direct flights, larger-capacity data storage devices) are more popular when the additional cost is made explicit using differential price framing (DPF; e.g., “for $20 more”) rather than being left implicit, as in standard inclusive price framing (IPF; e.g., “for $60 total”). The DPF effect is driven by pricing focalism: relative to IPF, DPF creates a focus on the price difference, which, because it is smaller than the total price, leads to lower perceived expensiveness and thus greater choice share for the premium option. This price framing effect is robust to displaying the total cost of the purchase, bad deals, and easy-to-compute price differences, and it appears to be uniquely effective in pricing contexts. However, DPF effects are reduced among consumers who adopt a slow and effortful decision process. These findings have implications for research on price partitioning, the design of effective pricing strategy, the sources of expensiveness perceptions in the marketplace, and consumer welfare.","Thomas Allard, David J.

The “Commitment Projection” Effect: When Multiple Payments for a Product Affect Defection from a Service,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719850504,14-Jul-19,01-Oct-19,56,5,842,861,"Many service providers offer supplementary products related to their ongoing services (e.g., fitness centers offer fitness smartwatches). In seven studies, the authors show that the payment method for such supplementary products (multiple payments vs. a single lump sum) affects customers’ tendency to defect from the provider’s core service over time. Specifically, when customers pay for add-ons in multiple payments—provided that (1) they perceive the add-on as being bundled with the core service and (2) the payment period has an end point—they are initially less likely to defect from the service provider than when they pay in a single payment. Over time, however, as payments are made, this gap closes, such that defection intentions under the two payment methods eventually become similar. The authors propose that this phenomenon reflects “commitment projection,” wherein a decrease in customers’ commitment to the add-on product over time is projected onto their commitment to the service provider. These findings carry important managerial implications, given that many service providers offer add-on products in multiple-payment plans and that customers’ defection decisions substantially affect firms’ profitability.","Irit Nitzan, Danit Ein-Gar","commitment, customer defection, multiple payments",0

Furthermore, two important moderators are identified: the positive effects of logo descriptiveness are considerably attenuated for brands that are familiar (vs. unfamiliar) to consumers and reversed (i.e., negative) for brands that market a type of product/service linked with negatively (vs. positively) valenced associations in consumers’ minds.

This is because customization leads customers to perceive the product in line with their own self-image (e.g., as an unhealthy eater), a phenomenon that the authors term “self-image-consistent product perceptions.” Essentially, customization may influence product perceptions depending on the product and individuals’ self-image; this can have downstream consequences on recommendations and social media communication. The authors test this theory for different product categories (clothing, food, and vacation packages) and attributes (fashionable, healthy, and adventurous) and demonstrate that framing customization as a simple choice or strengthening product positioning through labeling mitigates negative effects of customization.","Anne-Kathrin Klesse, Yann Cornil, Darren William Dahl,...","customization, product perceptions, product recommendations, self-image",1

Seven experimental studies reveal that consumers display compensatory responses when they interact with an HSR rather than a human employee (e.g., they favor purchasing status goods, seek social affiliation, and order and eat more food). The authors investigate the underlying process driving these effects, and they find that HSRs elicit greater consumer discomfort (i.e., eeriness and a threat to human identity), which in turn results in the enhancement of compensatory consumption. Moreover, this research identifies boundary conditions of the effects such that the compensatory responses that HSRs elicit are (1) mitigated when consumer-perceived social belongingness is high, (2) attenuated when food is perceived as more healthful, and (3) buffered when the robot is machinized (rather than anthropomorphized).","Martin Mende, Maura L.

Mortality and hubris can cause imbalance, but with the right skills and structures, these factors can be proactively managed. Inconsistency in the meanings of the person versus the brand can derive from the person’s unpredictability and social embeddedness and compromise brand value, but it may also enhance brand value by adding needed intimacy and authenticity.

Furthermore, the authors find that managers who exert greater vigilance to achieve more accurate evaluations of the new product idea are especially vulnerable to the biasing effect, leading to less accurate evaluations.

Difference-in-differences analyses of matched treatment and control groups show that the bench program had an immediate and sustained impact on performance. Moreover, laggards improved their performance more than higher performers, and salespeople with larger advice networks improved their performance more than salespeople with smaller advice networks. A lab experiment compares the bench program with a program that had the same threat of firing but did not have replacements in sight. Performance in the bench program exceeded that in the firing condition, indicating that the vividness of a threat can increase its deterrent value.","Jeffrey P.

Sales Force Compensation Design for Two-Sided Market Platforms,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243719825818,03-Jun-19,01-Aug-19,56,4,666,678,"The authors study the use of sales agents for network mobilization in a two-sided market platform that connects buyers and sellers, and they examine how the presence of direct and indirect network effects influences the design of the sales compensation plan. They employ a principal–agent model in which the firm tasks sales agents to mobilize the side of the platform that it monetizes (i.e., sellers). Specifically, the presence of network effects alters the agency relationship between the firm and the sales agent, requiring the platform firm to alter the compensation design, and the nature of the alteration depends on whether the network effects are direct or indirect and positive or negative. The authors first show how the agent’s compensation plan should account for different types of network effects. They then establish that when the platform firm compensates the agent solely on the basis of network mobilization on the side cultivated by the agent (sellers), as intuition would suggest, it will not fully capitalize on the advantage of positive network effects; that is, profit can be lower under stronger network effects. To overcome this limitation, the platform should link the agent’s pay to a second metric, specifically, network mobilization on the buyer side, even though the agent is not assigned to that side. This design induces a positive relation between the strength of network effects and profit. This research underlines the complexity and richness of network effects and provides managers with new insights regarding the design of sales agents’ compensation plans for platforms.","Hemant K.

The authors show that this may not hold in a channel setting with exclusive retailers. They find that a manufacturer and its retailer can both become worse off if their competing manufacturer and retailer with quality-differentiated products exit the market. Put differently, in a channel setting, more intense competition can be all-win for the manufacturer, the retailer, and the consumers. Interestingly, a high-quality manufacturer can benefit from an increase in its competitor’s perceived quality (e.g., due to favorable product reviews from consumers or third-party rating agencies). In other words, a manufacturer may prefer a strong rather than a weak enemy, and the manufacturer can have an incentive to help its competitor improve product quality or remain in the market. Furthermore, the authors show that a multiproduct monopolist manufacturer with an exclusive retailer may make higher profits by spinning off a product into a competing manufacturer that has its own retail channel, even without accounting for any proceeds from the spinoff.","Mushegh Harutyunyan, Baojun Jiang","channel, competitive strategy, double marginalization, market entry, market exit, pricing",0

This prestige effect gives the commercial publication incentive to act contrary to the best interest of the students. If a ranking created with the commonly used attribute-and-aggregate methodology creates prestige, then to maximize profit the publication needs to (1) choose attribute score weights that do not match student preferences and (2) alter those attribute score weights over time, even in the absence of changes to student preferences and/or education technology. Without a prestige effect, the publication should choose attribute score weights that match student preferences. This model also defines a student-optimal ranking methodology that maximizes the sum of the students’ utilities.

Assessing Sensitive Consumer Behavior Using the Item Count Response Technique,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718821312,21-Mar-19,01-Jun-19,56,3,345,360,"The authors propose a new truth-telling technique and statistical model called “item count response technique” (ICRT) to assess the prevalence and drivers of sensitive consumer behavior. Monte Carlo simulations and a large-scale application to self-reported cigarette consumption among pregnant women (n = 1,315) demonstrate the effectiveness of the procedure. The ICRT provides more valid and precise prevalence estimates and is more efficient than direct self-reports and previous item count techniques. It accomplishes this by (1) incentivizing participants to provide truthful answers, (2) accounting for procedural nonadherence and differential list functioning, and (3) obviating the need for a control group. The ICRT also facilitates the use of multivariate regression analysis to relate the prevalence of the sensitive behavior to individual-level covariates for theory testing and policy analysis. The empirical application reveals a significant downward bias in prevalence estimates when questions about cigarette consumption were asked directly to pregnant women, or when standard item count techniques were used. The authors find lower smoking prevalence among women with higher levels of education and who are further along in their pregnancy, and a much higher prevalence among unmarried respondents.","Martijn G. de Jong, Rik Pieters","item count technique, item response theory, list experiment, sensitive questions, smoking",1

The authors find that the responsiveness of seeding targets strongly declines with status difference; thus, unknown music creators (the majority) do not generally benefit at all from seeding influencers. Instead, they should gradually build their status by targeting low-status users rather than attempt to “jump” by targeting high-status ones. This research extends the seeding literature by introducing the concept of risk to dissemination dynamics in online communications, showing that unknown music creators do not seed specific status levels but rather choose a portfolio of seeding targets while solving a risk versus return trade-off.

If firms do not properly manage product usage, demand may drop, and public policy makers may intervene. The authors of this study test alternative ways to manage the use of such products: redesigning the timing of rewards, introducing notifications to users, and imposing time limits. A continuous-time demand model is proposed and empirically estimated with high-frequency data. The methodology is flexible enough to simultaneously explain multiple usage decisions that happen in quick succession, such as when to start and stop usage and how to respond to rewards or messages from the firm. The approach is implemented on a data set from the online gaming industry that includes usage decisions of a large sample of individuals. The authors find that improving reward schedules and imposing time limits leads to shorter usage sessions and longer product subscriptions—a win-win outcome.

The impact of retargeting decreases as the time since the consumer first visited the website increases—indeed, 33% of the effect of the first week’s advertising occurs on the first day. Furthermore, the authors find evidence of the existence of complementarities in advertising over time: the effect of advertising in week 2 of the campaign is higher when the user was assigned to a nonzero level of advertising in week 1.

Using a field experiment, the authors vary the design parameters of the sample and, based on the demand estimates, provide recommendations for the firm on the optimal design of the sample.

Given the competitive landscape, manufacturers’ distribution strategies should be based on anticipation of competitor reactions. Accordingly, the authors develop a manufacturer-level competition model to study the distribution and price decisions of insecticide manufacturers competing across multiple product forms and retail channels. Their study shows that both consumer preferences and estimated production and distribution costs vary across brands, product forms, and retail channels; that ignoring distribution and solely focusing on price competition results in up to a 55% overestimation of manufacturer profit margins; and that observed pricing and distribution patterns support competition rather than collusion among manufacturers. Through counterfactual studies, the authors find that manufacturers respond to decreases in distribution costs and to the exclusive distribution of more preferred manufacturers by asymmetrically changing their price and distribution decisions across different retail channels.","Amalesh Sharma, V.

Extending prior research that assumes that economic considerations (e.g., project quality, campaign success likelihood) drive backers’ decisions, the authors provide the cleanest field evidence so far that consumers also have prosocial motives to help creators reach their funding goals. They find that projects collect funding faster right before (vs. right after) meeting their funding goals because consumers not only are more likely to fund projects but also contribute greater amounts of money prior to goal attainment. This effect is amplified when the nature of a project tends to evoke consumers’ prosocial motivation and when a project’s creator is a single person. These results suggest that consumers’ prosocial motives not only play a role in reward-based crowdfunding but also can outweigh the opposing effects of economic factors including rational herding and certainty about campaign success.","Hengchen Dai, Dennis J.

Opportunity Cost Overestimation,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718819474,11-Apr-19,01-Jun-19,56,3,518,533,"Consumers often fail to utilize desirable offers they had originally selected and planned to use and thus later regret missing out on them. This failure to follow through induces an opportunity cost. In contrast to prior research findings that opportunity costs tend to be underestimated, the authors propose that in situations where the need to choose arises from external rather than internal constraints, opportunity costs may actually be overestimated. Consumers view choice constraints as external when the necessity to trade off one option for another relates to extraneous resource limitations (e.g., whenever time, budget, or space constraints necessitate choosing between two desirable offers). Conversely, consumers perceive choice constraints as internal when that trade-off is “built-in” (e.g., when a marketing incentive requires choosing between two desirable offers). Five studies demonstrate that choosing on the basis of an external constraint induces consumers to imagine ways in which they can utilize all of the competing options in the choice set. Consequently, consumers feel that by failing to utilize their chosen option, they simultaneously miss out on all options (although in actuality they could have realized only one of those options). Consistent with this conceptualization, only consumers who want to use all of the choice set options simultaneously demonstrate opportunity cost overestimation.","Liad Weiss, Ran Kivetz","opportunity cost, perceived loss, judgment and decision making, decision bias",9

The present research helps fill this void by uncovering the novel impact of sleepiness on consumer variety-seeking behavior. The studies, using various methods and all involving consequential choices, revealed that sleepier consumers tended to seek more variety. The driver of this effect was found to be a need for arousal to maintain wakefulness. The authors also show that variety-seeking behavior is effective in partially reducing sleepiness. The effect of sleepiness on variety seeking uncovered in this research is somewhat nonintuitive, in the sense that, a priori, one might expect sleepiness to be more likely to decrease rather than increase exploratory behavior.

Five experiments demonstrate that posting products on social media that are framed as being identity-relevant can reduce a consumer’s subsequent purchase intentions for the same and similar products, as this action allows consumers to virtually signal their identity, fulfilling identity-signaling needs.

The author therefore presents a set of flexible Bayesian nonparametric (NP) dynamic models that treat error densities as unknown but assume that they emerge from Dirichlet process mixtures. Although the methods address misspecification in dynamic linear models, the main innovation is a particle filter algorithm for nonlinear state-space models. The author used two advertising studies to confirm the benefits of the methods when strict error assumptions are untenable. In both studies, NP models markedly outperformed benchmarks in terms of fit and forecast results. In the first study, the benchmarks understated the effects of competitive advertising on own brand awareness. In the second study, the benchmark inflated ad quality, and consequently, the effects of past advertising appeared 36% higher than that predicted by the NP model. In general, these methods should be valuable wherever state-space models appear (e.g., brand and advertising dynamics, diffusion of innovation, dynamic discrete choice).",Norris I.

For this reason, the literature finds that PMGs can only signal low prices when firm heterogeneity is sufficiently large. Because PMGs are offered by retailers that purchase the same product from the same producer, large firm heterogeneity may be a strong assumption.

The findings support the thesis that smartphone use results in the creation of content that is less specific and privileges affect—especially positive affect—relative to PC-generated content.

The effects on total sales are heterogeneous, ranging from net decreases to insignificant drops, motivating a targeting exercise comparing strategies that optimize promoted product sales versus total sales. Targeting for promoted product sales tends to assign promotions to customers who purchased similar products, whereas targeting for total sales assigns promotions on the basis of other user characteristics. Targeting for promoted product sales generated incremental total sales that amounted to approximately 29% of the optimal incremental total sales when targeting for total sales (an opportunity cost of 71%).

They develop a natural language processing tool, guided latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), that automatically extracts a set of features of entertainment products from their descriptions. Guided LDA is flexible enough to allow features to be informed by psychological themes while allowing other relevant dimensions to emerge. The authors apply this tool to movies and show that guided LDA features help better predict movie-watching behavior at the individual level. They find this result with both award-winning movies and blockbuster movies. They illustrate the potential of the proposed approach in pure content-based predictive models of consumer behavior, as well as in hybrid predictive models that combine content-based models with collaborative filtering. They also show that guided LDA can improve the performance of models that predict aggregate outcomes.","Olivier Toubia, Garud Iyengar, Renée Bunnell,...","topic models, natural language processing, entertainment industry, positive psychology, media psychology",15
Capital Market Returns to New Product Development Success: Informational Effects on Product Market Advertising,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718820560,27-Dec-18,01-Feb-19,56,1,37,56,"The authors aim to answer the following question: If the capital market reacts with abnormal stock returns to new product development success events, do these returns influence subsequent marketing decisions? Drawing on informational market feedback and managerial learning theories, the authors posit that when firms are uncertain about how responsive the product market will be to their marketing activities, signals received from the capital market help them update their beliefs about the product market’s responsiveness. In the pharmaceutical context, the authors decompose the abnormal returns at a new drug approval event into components that the firm can and cannot predict (i.e., predicted and unpredicted abnormal returns) and find that the postapproval advertising budget is larger when unpredicted abnormal approval returns are higher. Furthermore, this tendency is more pronounced for spending on detailing than for direct-to-consumer advertising. Consistent with these higher budgets, the authors find that postlaunch advertising is more effective when unpredicted abnormal approval returns are higher, particularly for detailing spending (vs. direct-to-consumer advertising). Overall, this study suggests that information flows from the capital market’s initial perceptions at new product introduction play an important role in subsequent marketing decisions in the product market.","Kyung M.

Wearout or Weariness? Measuring Potential Negative Consequences of Online Ad Volume and Placement on Website Visits,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718820587,28-Dec-18,01-Feb-19,56,1,57,75,"The global importance of online advertising calls for a detailed understanding of consumer-specific responses to online ad repetitions. A key concern for advertisers is not only whether some consumers display degrees of “wearout” but also whether they can surpass a point at which additional exposures have a negative marginal effect: “weariness.” The authors examine a large-scale advertising campaign aimed at driving viewers to a target website, which comprises more than 12,000 users across over 400 websites. These data are analyzed using a flexible discrete mixture specification that accommodates different response shapes over ad stock and timing and parcels ad viewers into response classes based on their internet usage metrics. The resulting classes display varying degrees of wearout, with one subgroup, accounting for about 24% of the sample, evincing weariness. The model also estimates differential publisher effectiveness, with the most effective publisher being nine times more effective than the one 26 places down. The authors demonstrate that the finding of weariness is robust to all the model’s main components, with one key exception: heterogeneity in users’ ad response. Analysis further suggests that an appropriate “profiling and capping” strategy can improve ad deployment by as much as 15% overall for these data.","Inyoung Chae, Hernán A. Bruno, Fred M.

Branded Apps and Their Impact on Firm Value: A Design Perspective,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718820588,03-Jan-19,01-Feb-19,56,1,76,88,"Although firms are increasingly launching branded mobile apps, an understanding of their influence on firm value remains elusive. Using stock market returns to assess firm value, the authors investigate the impact of branded mobile app announcements on such value. Moreover, recognizing that mobile apps generate various touchpoints in the customer journey, the authors also investigate how an app’s design shifts the effects of mobile apps on firm value. In particular, they investigate effects from whether an app emphasizes features related to peer-to-peer interactions about the brand, personal-oriented interactions between a customer and the brand, or the purchase phase itself. They find that the launch of a mobile app increases firm value and that the features emphasized in app design play an important role in such value creation.

Specifically, compared with symmetrical logos, asymmetrical logos tend to be more arousing, leading to increased perceptions of excitement. As such, consumers tend to perceive asymmetrical logos as more congruent with brands that have an exciting personality. This can boost consumers’ evaluations and the market’s financial valuations of such brands, a phenomenon referred to as the “visual asymmetry effect.” The studies also show that this interplay between brand personality and logo design occurs only for the personality of excitement and the visual property of asymmetry.

Falling Back on Numbers: When Preference for Numerical Product Information Increases after a Personal Control Threat,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718820570,19-Dec-18,01-Feb-19,56,1,104,122,"Despite the ubiquity of numerical information in consumers’ lives, prior research has provided limited insights to marketers about when numerical information exerts greater impact on decisions.

A numerical attribute’s format communicates the extent to which the magnitude of a benefit is predictable (Study 1a), such that people who experience a control threat and want to see their external environment as predictable (Study 1b) rely on point value (vs. range) information as a general signal that the environment is predictable (Study 2). A personal control threat changes consumers’ preferences as a function of whether the numerical information appears as a point value or a range (Studies 3–4). This heightened focus on format may lessen the impact of a product benefit’s predicted magnitude, if a lower magnitude is specified in a more precise format (Study 5).

The Smell of Healthy Choices: Cross-Modal Sensory Compensation Effects of Ambient Scent on Food Purchases,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718820585,04-Jan-19,01-Feb-19,56,1,123,141,"Managers are using ambient scent as an important strategic element in various service settings, with food-related scents being especially common. This research examines the effects of food-related ambient scents on children’s and adults’ food purchases/choices. The results of a series of experiments, including field studies at a supermarket and at a middle school cafeteria, show that extended exposure (of more than two minutes) to an indulgent food–related ambient scent (e.g., cookie scent) leads to lower purchases of unhealthy foods compared with no ambient scent or a nonindulgent food–related ambient scent (e.g., strawberry scent). The effects seem to be driven by cross-modal sensory compensation, whereby prolonged exposure to an indulgent/rewarding food scent induces pleasure in the reward circuitry, which in turn diminishes the desire for actual consumption of indulgent foods. Notably, the effects reverse with brief (<30 seconds) exposure to the scent. Whereas prior research has examined cross-modal effects, this research adopts the novel approach of examining cross-modal sensory compensation effects, whereby stimuli in one sensory modality (olfactory) can compensate/satisfy the desire related to another sensory modality (gustatory).","Dipayan Biswas, Courtney Szocs","ambient scent, cross-modal sensory compensation effects, (un)healthy food choices, retail and service setting atmospherics, sensory marketing",543

In this article, the authors propose a different strategy for responding to dissimilar users, upgrading to a brand’s more exclusive products. Results from six studies show that upgrading is a preferred strategy for consumers with strong self–brand connections, who are unlikely to avoid or abandon the brand because their self-identity is tied to the brand. Among these consumers, the act of upgrading to a brand’s more exclusive products is driven by their feelings of self-threat when exposed to dissimilar users, which triggers a desire to attain a higher-status position among brand users that is fulfilled by upgrading. The authors also identify moderators of the upgrading effect for consumers with strong self–brand connections. These consumers’ increased interest in upgrading is dampened when a brand’s exclusive products are made more readily available and when a brand has already conferred higher status to them through a customer status tier program.","Yajin Wang, Deborah Roedder John","brand management, brands, status, self–brand connections",8

With these two dimensions of sound and meaning, the authors propose a four-way categorization of brand name types for logographic languages: alphanumeric, phonetic, phonosemantic, or semantic. Using automobile sales data from China and a discrete choice model for differentiated products, the authors relate brand name types to demand, with evidence showing that Chinese consumers preferred vehicle models with semantic brand names (7.64% more sales than alphanumeric) but exhibited the least preference for phonosemantic names (4.92% lower sales than alphanumeric). Domestic Chinese firms benefited from semantic brand names, whereas foreign firms gained from using foreign-sounding brand names. Entry-level products performed better with semantic brand names, and high-end products excelled when they had foreign-sounding brand names. Thus, the four-way categorization of brand name types should help multinational firms and domestic Chinese firms understand and leverage the association between brand name types and consumer demand.","Fang Wu, Qi Sun, Rajdeep Grewal,...","automobile market, brand name types, Chinese consumers, consumer demand, linguistics",11

Consistent with the bounded rationality literature, we find that as Prob increases from 0 to 1, consumers process the choice-relevant information more carefully and more comprehensively. Consistent with the psychological distance literature, we find that as Prob increases from 0 to 1, consumers become less novelty seeking and more price sensitive. These findings underscore that even with incentive alignment, preference measurement choice experiments such as choice-based conjoint analyses only represent an approximation of real-life choices. Although it is not feasible to systematically use questions with high Prob in the field, we predict and find that placing a higher probability question (such as an external validity task) at the beginning rather than the end of a questionnaire has a carryover effect on attention and information processing throughout the questionnaire, and it influences preference estimates as well.","Liu (Cathy) Yang, Olivier Toubia, Martijn G. de Jong","incentive alignment, choice experiments, preference measurement, eye tracking",8

The authors propose a conceptual framework to present spikes as a standalone WOM dimension and explain their emergence. They employ a robust filtering procedure to detect spikes and apply it in a data set of 90,000 prerelease online WOM messages on 157 Hollywood movies. The results indicate that prerelease spikes are widely prevalent: While some of them are event-driven, emerging in response to firm-created communications (e.g., trailer release), they are far more likely to emerge spontaneously. Content analysis reveals that WOM in spikes is more positive in sentiment and is more likely to deal with factual details than is WOM outside spikes.

To Bargain or Not to Bargain: The Role of Fixed Costs in Price Negotiations,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718818451,18-Dec-18,01-Dec-18,55,6,832,851,"Retailers routinely allow consumers to negotiate a discount off the posted price for big-ticket items such as home appliances and automobiles, and on online platforms such as Amazon and eBay. The profitability of such a strategy, relative to selling only at posted prices, depends on consumers’ willingness to initiate a negotiation and ability to negotiate a discount. In this article, the authors incorporate consumers’ decision of whether to negotiate into a demand model. The decision to negotiate hinges on how the expected discount from negotiation compares with the magnitude of a nonpecuniary cost that the consumer incurs by initiating the negotiation. The current study shows how this cost can be nonparametrically identified, separately from consumers’ ability to get a discount and marginal utility of income. The application of this model to individual-level data on refrigerator transactions reveals that, conditional on negotiating, consumers get, on average, 41% of the available surplus and incur an average cost of $28 to initiate a negotiation. The magnitude of these nonpecuniary costs’ not only affects retailer profits but also has implications for pricing strategy and consumer surplus. Ignoring these costs results in biased estimates of consumers’ willingness to pay, translating to annual losses of $1.6 million in the current study setting.","Pranav Jindal, Peter Newberry","bargaining, bargaining costs, fixed pricing, Nash equilibrium, price discrimination",6

The framework specifies two broad mechanisms to account for the three forms of misresponse: lack of motivation to process items in detail (“inattention”) and lack of ability to comprehend items accurately (“difficulty”). The authors propose a procedure to identify potential misresponse effects on the observed item responses and factor loadings, and they report two empirical studies to test the framework; the second study uses eye movement recordings to examine the underlying process.

They measure whether the marketing activities (outreach camps) of Aravind that are targeted only to poor patients produce the spillover benefit of attracting paying patients to its hospitals. Using nine years of patient-level historical data, the authors find that camps increase the flow of paying patients. These effects are comparable to the camps acting as advertising for Aravind.

Additionally, they find that consumers are significantly more likely to accept pseudo-free offers (with nonmonetary costs) than comparable nonfree offers (with monetary costs). The authors provide evidence that consumers respond to pseudo-free offers in this way because, in general, consumers generate neutral or positive attributions for why firms make these offers, and these attributions, in turn, lead consumers to perceive the pseudo-free offers as fair. However, when contextual influences, characteristics of the pseudo-free offer, or individual dispositions increase the likelihood of negative attributions, consumers’ preference for pseudo-free offers is attenuated.","Steven K.

Specifically, in six studies, the authors find that, in sequential choice settings, individuals exhibit significant positive state dependence in risk-taking preferences, such that they are more likely to take a risk when it is similar to a previously taken risk than when it is dissimilar. For example, if an individual has previously taken a health/safety risk, that individual is more likely to take a second health/safety risk than a second risk that is in the financial domain. The authors show that because similarity between risks is malleable and can be determined by situational and contextual variables, subsequent risk-taking intentions can be changed in a predictable manner when similarity is manipulated through framing. The authors establish that increased feelings of self-efficacy and self-signaling through the prior risk-taking experience drive state-dependent risk-taking preferences. The authors further show that the effect of similarity on preferences is not moderated by the outcome received in the prior risk and holds when controlling for individual-level and domain-specific heterogeneity. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the similarity structures that exist between risks have a significant effect on risk-taking preferences in dynamic choice settings.","Elizabeth C.

In line with egocentric categorization theory, which identifies the self as a dominant reference category in product judgment, the authors demonstrate cognitive drivers of the effect. Specifically, egocentric improvement evaluations are moderated by self-focus, which determines whether the self is an accessible reference category. Furthermore, the authors propose that egocentric improvement evaluations also have a motivational driver: consumers project their self-improvement onto self-connected brands to satisfy self-enhancement motives. The core effect is moderated by self-affirmation, which quells the need for self-enhancement, and by self-threat, which heightens the need for self-enhancement.

While much progress has been made in building a well-validated customer-based valuation model for contractual (or subscription-based) firms, there has been little progress for noncontractual firms. Noncontractual businesses have more complex transactional patterns because customer churn is not observed, and customer purchase timing and spend amounts are more irregular. Furthermore, publicly disclosed data are aggregated over time and across customers, are often censored, and may vary from firm to firm, making it harder to estimate models for customer acquisition, ordering, and spend per order. The authors develop a general customer-based valuation methodology for noncontractual firms that accounts for these issues.

Online Reputation Mechanisms and the Decreasing Value of Chain Affiliation,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718802844,17-Oct-18,01-Oct-18,55,5,636,654,"This article investigates the value of business format franchising and how it is changing in response to a large increase in consumer information provided by online reputation mechanisms. Theory has suggested that much of the value of chain affiliation to firms comes from the ability of chain partners to use the same name, imagery, logo, and marketing to create a common brand reputation and signal specific qualities in settings with asymmetric information between buyers and sellers. As more information becomes available, consumers should rely less on branding for quality signals, and firms’ ability to extend reputations across heterogeneous outlets should decrease. To examine this empirically, the author combines a large panel of hotel revenues with millions of online reviews from multiple platforms. Chain-affiliated hotels earn substantially higher revenues than equivalent independent hotels, but this premium has declined by over 50% from 2000 to 2015. This can be largely attributed to an increase in online reputation mechanisms, and this effect is largest for low-quality and small-market firms. Measures of the information content of online reviews show that as information has increased, independent hotel revenue has grown substantially more than chain hotel revenue. This result should be viewed as descriptive, with attempts to come to near causality including the use of machine learning to derive latent dimensions of firm quality from the text of online reviews. Finally, the correlation between firm revenue and chain-wide reputation is decreasing, whereas the correlation with individual hotel reputation is increasing.",Brett Hollenbeck,"Branding, online reviews, online platforms, franchising, machine learning",10
How Evaluations of Multiple Percentage Price Changes Are Influenced by Presentation Mode and Percentage Ordering: The Role of Anchoring and Surprise,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718808554,16-Oct-18,01-Oct-18,55,5,655,666,"To advance theory, this study details how consumers evaluate multiple percentage price changes (discounts or surcharges). If they consider two discounts—for example, take 18% off the list price, then take an additional 12% off—consumers weight the two percentages to make their evaluations. Cues endogenous to the communication of those percentages also influence the weights applied, according to whether the two percentages appear presented at the same time (simultaneously) or temporally separated (sequentially) and whether the first percentage is larger or smaller. Depending on both the presentation mode and the ordering, consumers use different processes. In addition to providing practical guidance, this article extends understanding of anchoring and adjustment processes; information presented simultaneously leads consumers to anchor on the first piece of information. Sequential presentation instead induces surprise and shifts attention to the latter percentage change, which serves as the anchor in subsequent judgments. In addition to the underlying theory for these effects, this article delineates some boundary conditions and reveals the effects on consumers’ evaluations and choices, with findings from 11 studies.","Derick F.

Many firms consider using attribution to allocate media budgets, particularly for digital media, but an important question is whether this is appropriate. An initial hurdle when answering this question is that, despite the surge in interest for media attribution in marketing academia and practice, attribution does not have an agreed-on formal definition. Therefore, this article proposes an attribution formulation based on the relative incremental contribution that each medium makes to a purchase, taking into account advertising carryover and interaction effects. The formulation shows that attribution is proportional to the marginal effectiveness of a medium times its number of exposures. This means that often-used media will have high attribution weights. However, the profit-maximizing allocation for a fixed budget is a function of advertising effectiveness, but not a function of past exposure levels. By offering analytical derivations and studying simulated and empirical data, the paper shows how attribution can offer misleading insights on how to allocate resources across media. Moreover, the empirical example demonstrates that substantial gains in purchase probability can be made using profit-maximizing allocation compared with attribution-based allocation.","Peter J.

When Does Partitioned Pricing Lead to More Favorable Consumer Preferences?: Meta-Analytic Evidence,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718800724,11-Oct-18,01-Oct-18,55,5,686,703,"Evidence of the impact of partitioned pricing is contradictory. Research indicates that partitioning a price into multiple components can result in more favorable preferences, due to a lower recalled price, or less favorable preferences, due to unfavorable surcharge evaluations. To explain these divergent effects, the authors examine the role of price presentation moderators, which reflect how managers convey prices to consumers (e.g., Is the total price present or absent?), magnitude moderators, which reflect the actual prices charged (e.g., What is the surcharge magnitude?), and contextual moderators, which reflect nonprice transaction characteristics (e.g., Is the product category hedonic or utilitarian?). A meta-analysis of 17 years of partitioned pricing research examining 149 observations in 27 papers (N = 12,878) suggests that consumers respond more favorably to partitioned pricing than to all-inclusive pricing when the total price is absent, as the price level increases, when the surcharges are typical for the product category, when the surcharges are perceived as offering high benefit, and when the product category is utilitarian.","Ajay T.

Does Selective Sales Force Training Work?,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718803096,12-Oct-18,01-Oct-18,55,5,722,737,"Companies spend billions of dollars annually on sales force training, often carried out as off-site, multiday training events. However, the numerous challenges involved in training an entire sales group force many retailers to selectively train only a subset of their salespeople. It is crucial to know when selective training can be more effective and what composition of salespeople should be trained to benefit the entire group. This study addresses these questions using data from several stores of a retailer with different sales force training policies (full, selective, and no training [control]). The authors track the degree to which salespeople applied a customer relationship—building strategy taught in the training, along with more than 30 store- and salesperson-level covariates, and perform various analyses to correct for selection issues. They find that (1) selective training can be highly effective in stores with low performance diversity, (2) training salespeople with diverse tenures helps the spillover of training to the untrained, and (3) untrained salespeople with performance that is similar to the trained group are more likely to adopt the training-related behavior.","Yashar Atefi, Michael Ahearne, James G.

Intercompetitor Licensing and Product Innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022243718802846,17-Oct-18,01-Oct-18,55,5,738,751,"This article explores how intercompetitor licensing between an incumbent and an entrant affects market competition and the entrant’s optimal product quality. In the model, the incumbent has a noncore technology that is used for the noncore attribute of the final product, and the entrant has a new core technology to introduce a new, higher-quality product. For the noncore technology of its product, the entrant can either license it from the incumbent or develop it in-house. The authors show that a royalty licensing contract of the noncore technology between the incumbent and the entrant has a competition-alleviating effect. More important, the effect of such licensing on the entrant’s optimal quality depends on whether its core technology can significantly or only incrementally increase its product quality over the incumbent’s product quality. The royalty contract will tend to increase the entrant’s optimal quality when the entrant’s core technology can offer a significant quality improvement over the incumbent’s. By contrast, if the entrant’s technology can raise its product quality only incrementally over the incumbent’s product quality, the royalty contract will tend to reduce the entrant’s optimal quality. A wide range of royalty licensing contracts are mutually acceptable; the incumbent (entrant) can benefit from such a contract even when the entrant pays a total royalty fee that is lower (higher) than its alternative research-and-development cost. These results hold even when the incumbent endogenously chooses its royalty licensing fee. The main results are robust to several alternative modeling assumptions (e.g., alternative game sequence, endogenous quality decision by the incumbent, alternative licensing contract).","Baojun Jiang, Hongyan Shi","competition, intercompetitor licensing, pricing, product quality, royalty",6

Building on this literature, the authors suggest that the salience of product ownership not only activates the product-related self but also simultaneously deactivates product-unrelated selves, resulting in impaired performance on tasks unrelated to the activated self. In five experiments, we first elicit feelings of ownership over a product (e.g., a calculator) to activate a product-related identity (e.g., the math self). Participants then engage in a task that is labeled as being a product-related task (e.g., a math task) or a product-unrelated task (e.g., a visual task). Although the task is the same, participants in the ownership condition perform worse on a task labeled as product-unrelated than those in the baseline condition do. Support for the underlying identity activation process comes from the finding that performance impairment is more likely to hold under conditions of low self-concept clarity, in which identity is malleable. The authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this finding.","Jaeyeon Chung, Gita V. Johar","ownership, identity, self-concept clarity, task performance, possessions",6

When Showrooming Increases Retailer Profit,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.17.0059,01-Aug-18,01-Aug-18,55,4,459,473,"Showrooming, the phenomenon of consumers visiting a brick-and-mortar (B&M) store to learn about products but then buying online to obtain lower prices, is attracting increased attention both in business practice and in academic literature. It is considered a major threat to the B&M retailers, and determining “how to fight it” seems to be the only consideration. However, the manufacturer's need for retail informational services has always been one of the essential reasons for retailers to exist and is a means for retailers to achieve profitability. The popular arguments about the threat of showrooming ignore the strategic role of the manufacturer in the distribution channel. This article analytically shows that when the manufacturer's decisions are considered (i.e., when the manufacturer–retailer contract is endogenous), consumers’ ability to engage in showrooming may lead to increased, rather than decreased, profitability for B&M retailer(s). Thus, retail efforts to restrict showrooming behavior may be misguided. This result holds even if the manufacturer is restricted to wholesale-only contracts and is not allowed to price discriminate between channels.","Dmitri Kuksov, Chenxi Liao","showrooming, free riding, service, retail competition, channel coordination, game theory",0

Efficient Large-Scale Internet Media Selection Optimization for Online Display Advertising,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0307,01-Aug-18,01-Aug-18,55,4,489,506,"In today's digital market, the number of websites available for advertising has ballooned into the millions. Consequently, firms often turn to ad agencies and demand-side platforms (DSPs) to decide how to allocate their Internet display advertising budgets. Nevertheless, most extant DSP algorithms are rule-based and strictly proprietary. This article is among the first efforts in marketing to develop a nonproprietary algorithm for optimal budget allocation of Internet display ads within the context of programmatic advertising. Unlike many DSP algorithms that treat each ad impression independently, this method explicitly accounts for viewership correlations across websites. Consequently, campaign managers can make optimal bidding decisions over the entire set of advertising opportunities. More Importantly, they can avoid overbidding for impressions from high-cost publishers, unless such sites reach an otherwise unreachable audience. The proposed method can also be used as a budget-setting tool, because it readily provides optimal bidding guidelines for a range of campaign budgets. Finally, this method can accommodate several practical considerations including consumer targeting, target frequency of ad exposure, and mandatory media coverage to matched content websites.","Courtney Paulson, Lan Luo, Gareth M.

The authors develop hypotheses pertaining to the main effects of the three agglomeration types on eWOM volume, which take the form of an inverted U-shape, and the moderating effect of vertical quality differentiation. The authors test the hypotheses on the volume of eWOM generated per month on Yelp for restaurants in Phoenix, generated by 23,526 users for 2,885 restaurants over an eight-year period.

Modeling Gift Choice: The Effect of Uncertainty on Price Sensitivity,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.16.0453,01-Aug-18,01-Aug-18,55,4,524,540,"Gift giving generates high revenues for retailers. It is also marked with significant welfare, or deadweight, loss in that givers tend to pay more than the receivers’ valuation. Previous research has attributed this discrepancy to givers’ inaccurate predictions of the receivers’ preferences. This research demonstrates that reduced price sensitivity is another important source of the deadweight loss: givers use gift prices to signal the importance of their relationship with the receiver. In order to demonstrate this mechanism, the authors develop a new Bayesian gift-choice model that captures both preference predictions as well as the signaling value of price. The model is estimated on two choice-based conjoint studies for gift giving that allow for the manipulation of the giver's uncertainty about the receiver's preferences. Both studies show the strong signaling value of price, especially when givers are uncertain about receivers’ preferences. Decomposition of the deadweight loss shows that the signaling value of price is an important source of welfare loss, especially in markets with heterogeneous prices. These findings have key implications for the gift industry.","Sherry Shi Wang, Ralf Van Der Lans","gift giving, choice models, deadweight loss, price sensitivity, preference predictions",8
(I'm) Happy to Help (You): The Impact of Personal Pronoun Use in Customer–Firm Interactions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.16.0118,01-Aug-18,01-Aug-18,55,4,541,555,"In responding to customer questions or complaints, should marketing agents linguistically “put the customer first” by using certain personal pronouns? Customer orientation theory, managerial literature, and surveys of managers, customer service representatives, and consumers suggest that firm agents should emphasize how “we” (the firm) serve “you” (the customer), while de-emphasizing “I” (the agent) in these customer–firm interactions. The authors find evidence of this language pattern in use at over 40 firms. However, they theorize and demonstrate that these personal pronoun emphases are often suboptimal. Five studies using lab experiments and field data reveal that firm agents who refer to themselves using “I” rather than “we” pronouns increase customers’ perceptions that the agent feels and acts on their behalf. In turn, these positive perceptions of empathy and agency lead to increased customer satisfaction, purchase intentions, and purchase behavior. Furthermore, the authors find that customer-referencing “you” pronouns have little impact on these outcomes and can sometimes have negative consequences. These findings enhance understanding of how, when, and why language use affects social perception and behavior and provide valuable insights for marketers.","Grant Packard, Sarah G.

The authors further show that teasing is hedonically beneficial because uncertainty engenders curiosity and thereby builds a potential for a positive experience, whereas uncertainty resolution satisfies the curiosity and thereby realizes that potential. This research yields practical implications by demonstrating that imbuing an ad with an uncertainty creation–resolution process improves the viewer's attitude toward and increases the viewer's willingness to try the advertised product.","Bowen Ruan, Christopher K.

Using data on content sharing from two directed social media platforms (Twitter and Digg), the authors establish that a receiver is more likely to share content from a sender with whom they share more common followees, common followers, or common mutual followers even after accounting for other measures. In addition, common followers have a higher effect than common mutual followers on the sharing propensity of the receiver. Finally, the effect of common followers and common mutual followers is positive when the content is novel but decreases, and may even become negative, when many others have already shared it.

Multiple studies, including a field study across four grocery stores, show that framing the discount depth by comparing it against the sale price increases consumers’ discount depth perceptions and thus increases purchase intentions. As evidence of the underlying process, the authors identify boundary conditions related to both individual differences (numeracy) and managerially relevant factors (discount depth size).

After controlling for salesperson, seasonality, year, and target effects, the authors estimate that sales, on average, dropped by 4.36%. Furthermore, they estimated individual-level sales changes and effort changes to validate the incentive–effort–sales causal chain. The results show that the top salespeople experienced the largest drops in sales. A post-intervention survey of social and individual difference variables reveals that salespeople from households with more discretionary financial resources and those who think more abstractly about the uses of cash income exhibited smaller reductions in effort and sales.

Head turn frequency, eye movements, and consumers’ direct choices in the lab and in the field are used to document a U-shaped pattern of information avoidance behavior, which paradoxically contributes to the phenomenon whereby goal pursuers become “stuck in the middle” of their pursuits.

Matchmakers in various industries often advertise proprietary technologies that presumably help users find an ideal match in a short time.

This article considers a matchmaking market with network effects and strategic consumers and analyzes under what conditions matchmakers would offer more effective versus less effective matchmaking services. The authors find that stronger pricing power paradoxically leads to lower technology provision when consumers have high valuation for the matchmaking service. Moreover, network effects typically encourage matchmakers to retain the users in the market to create positive externalities, which can result in less precise matchmaking. In addition, consumer patience prompts competing matchmakers to implement ineffective technology.

Using daily ticket prices and attendance by theater and movie, the authors empirically examine the potential gains from differentiated movie-specific pricing as well as the increasingly common two-tier (2D/3D) uniform pricing, as compared with a full uniform pricing strategy in which a theater charges the same price for all its movies. Their results show that differential pricing leads to higher profits than the two-tier uniform pricing practice, but that the improvement is limited. In contrast, the gains are substantial when compared with the full uniform pricing strategy, suggesting that only minimal differentiation (2D/3D) may obtain most of the gains available from fully differentiated prices.","Jason Y.C.

Five studies demonstrate that, in contrast to thoughts about one's own mortality, exposure to death-related information in the media can shift consumers’ focus from extrinsic to intrinsic values. This leads them to pay less attention to the marketing stimuli, which are generally associated with extrinsic values, and consequently results in lower sensitivity to the magnitude of products and services. These effects are reversed when the marketing stimuli are associated with intrinsic values. Moreover, we found that exposure to death-related media information will generate effects similar to those of mortality salience when the information is perceived to be self-relevant and thus could induce death anxiety.

The prevailing notion is that satiation increases with similarity; hence, consumers can best slow satiation by consuming stimuli that are as different as possible. We challenge this traditional (and intuitive) view and instead propose that stimuli can be so inherently different that consumers no longer spontaneously consider them together as part of the same experience. In such cases, promoting the similarity of the stimuli can counterintuitively slow satiation. We propose that this reversal happens because finding similarities leads the consumer to place these episodes into a single ad hoc category for the ongoing experience, thereby helping the consumer fully realize the overall variety inherent across all stimuli. Five studies establish this finding across multiple domains (music, art, and food) and provide process evidence that an ad hoc categorization for the overall experience underlies our effect.

When and how Managers' Responses to Online Reviews Affect Subsequent Reviews,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0511,01-Apr-18,01-Apr-18,55,2,163,177,"In this study, the authors investigate the externalities of managers' responses (MRs) to online reviews on popular travel websites. Specifically, the authors examine the effect of publicly responding to hotel guests' reviews on subsequent reviewer ratings. The authors find that manager responses to negative reviews (MR-N) can significantly influence subsequent opinion in a positive way if those responses are observable at the time of reviewing. Notably, the findings show this externality to be negative for manager responses to positive reviews (MR-P). The authors conduct a topic analysis on review texts and corresponding MRs to study the moderating role of response tailoring on the opinion externalities of MR. The authors show that tailored MR amplifies the positive (negative) impact of MR-N (MR-P) on subsequent opinion. Intuitively, tailoring an MR-N adds specificity to the hotel's complaint management strategy, bolstering the positive effects of MR-N on subsequent opinion. However, by highlighting specific positive elements of a review, managers' intent for responding is brought into question as they take advantage of reviewers' positive feedback to promote their hotel.","Yang Wang, Alexander Chaudhry","online reviews, manager response, causal inference, topic analysis",14
Frontline Problem-Solving Effectiveness: A Dynamic Analysis of Verbal and Nonverbal Cues,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0243,01-Apr-18,01-Apr-18,55,2,178,192,"This study examines the impact of frontline employees' problem solving on customer satisfaction (CSAT) during ongoing interactions prompted by service failures and complaints. Using outsourced regulation theory, the authors predict negative moderating effects of frontline relational work and displayed affect on the dynamic influence of frontline solving work on CSAT. Frontline employees' verbal (nonverbal) cues provide the basis to identify solving and relational work (displayed affect). The authors test hypotheses with data from video recordings of real-life problem-solving interactions involving airline customers as well as a controlled experimental study. They find that frontline solving work has a positive effect on CSAT, and it increases in magnitude as the interaction unfolds. However, this positive effect becomes weaker for relatively higher levels of frontline relational work or displayed affect and, conversely, stronger for relatively lower levels over time. In summary, overdoing relational work and overdisplaying positive affect diminish the efficacy of problem-solving interactions, a finding that provides implications for theory and practice.","Detelina Marinova, Sunil K.

The Club Store Effect: Impact of Shopping in Warehouse Club Stores on Consumers' Packaged Food Purchases,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.16.0235,01-Apr-18,01-Apr-18,55,2,193,207,"This article studies the impact of shopping at the warehouse club format on households' purchases of packaged food for the home. In addition to low prices, this format has several unique characteristics that can influence packaged food purchases. The empirical analysis uses a combination of households' longitudinal grocery purchase information, rich survey data, and detailed item-level nutrition information. After accounting for selection on observables and unobservables, the authors find a substantial increase in the total quantity (servings per capita) of packaged food purchases attributable to shopping at this format. Because there is no effect on the nutritional quality of purchases, this translates into a substantial increase in calories, sugar, and saturated fat per capita. The increase comes primarily from storable and impulse foods, and it is drawn equally from foods that have positive and negative health halos. The results have important implications for how marketers can create win–win opportunities for themselves and for consumers.","Kusum L.

Are you Back for Good or Still Shopping Around?

To better support retention, it is important to understand how the revived relationship evolves and possibly ends again. To examine customers' repeat churn behavior, we develop a “mixture cure-competing risks” model, jointly estimating the duration of second lifetimes, multiple reasons for churn, and heterogeneity of customers in exhibiting a related churn reason. The proposed model is tested using a data set from a large telecommunications provider including information on customer behavior and marketing activities during customers' first and second lifetimes. We find support for the existence of a “cured” group of returning customers, defined as those who are not susceptible to churn for the same reason they churned previously. Our findings suggest that mitigating repeat churn behavior can extend customers' second lifetime tenure and increase profitability by $150,000 over the lifetime of the customers in the sample (leading to gains of over $15 million for deferring second-lifetime churn in a million returning customers), depending on the type of churn.","V.

Double Mental Discounting: When a Single Price Promotion Feels Twice as Nice,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0559,01-Apr-18,01-Apr-18,55,2,226,238,"This research finds that when a single gain has strong associations with multiple costs, consumers often mentally deduct that gain from perceived costs multiple times. For example, with some price promotions (e.g., spend $200 now and receive a $50 gift card to spend in the future), consumers mentally deduct the value of the price promotion from the cost of the first purchase when they receive the promotion, as well as from the cost of the second purchase when they use the promotion. Multiple mental deductions based on a single gain result in consumers' perceptions that their costs are lower than they actually are, which can trigger higher expenditures. This mental accounting phenomenon, referred to as “double mental discounting,” is driven by the extent to which gains feel associated, or coupled, with multiple purchases. This article also documents methods to decouple promotional gains from purchases, thus mitigating double mental discounting.","Andong Cheng, Cynthia Cryder","mental accounting, pricing, financial decision making, coupling, price promotions",12

In this article, the authors advance a new perspective on context-dependent choices, according to which context effects are a function of the relative advantage of one option over another and of the different strategies that decision makers evoke when making a choice. They propose that context effects resulting from the addition of a third option to a two-option set are more frequently observed when the added option is relatively similar (adjacent) to the “disadvantaged” alternative (i.e., the lower-share option) in the set.

Study 1, a natural longitudinal experiment, shows that a merger with a poorer-image firm immediately dilutes salespeople's organizational identification (OI), which in turn impairs their performance. As sense makers, salespeople who are more tenured experience stronger OI dilution, whereas those who perceive a high level of social inclusion experience weaker OI dilution. As sense givers, managers who emphasize the firm's strategic intent in their communication buffer the OI-dilution effect, whereas those who emphasize the firm's organizational culture aggravate the effect. Study 2, a scenario-based experiment, further demonstrates that the OI-dilution effect is stronger than the OI-enhancement effect from merging with a better-image firm. Furthermore, both studies confirm that the adverse effect of mergers and acquisitions that involve a mismatch of external image stems from image uncertainty rather than job uncertainty.","Raghu Bommaraju, Michael Ahearne, Zachary R.

Making Warnings about Misleading Advertising and Product Recalls more Effective: An Implicit Attitude Perspective,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0305,01-Apr-18,01-Apr-18,55,2,265,276,"The authors tested whether image-based information is more effective than text in changing implicit attitudes from positive to negative, even when both forms similarly change explicit attitudes. They studied corrective information (i.e., warnings about misleading advertising and product recall notices) because it is a common, important effort to change consumer attitudes. Corrective information in the form of pictures or imagery-evoking text, as well as direct instructions to imagine the scene, changed implicit attitudes more than plain, descriptive text, which is currently the most common warning method. Image-based stimuli can change implicit attitudes because they evoke vivid visual mental imagery of counterattitudinal valence (Experiments 1–2). Conditions that hindered the formation of visual mental imagery blocked implicit attitude change, whereas cognitive busyness did not (Experiment 3). In short, imagery-based information changed both explicit and implicit attitudes, whereas materials not based on imagery changed only explicit attitudes. Managers and regulators who aim to protect consumers from claims and products that could do harm should use image-based campaigns to best convey the message effectively.","Olivier Trendel, Marc Mazodier, Kathleen D.

How Deviations from Performance Norms Impact Charitable Donations,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0509,01-Apr-18,01-Apr-18,55,2,277,290,"Although the actions of others can influence a consumer's behavior, these actions are often at odds with performance norms. For example, charities can experience relatively low rates of support (resulting in a negative deviation from a performance norm) or relatively high rates of support (resulting in a positive deviation from a performance norm). Previous research provides evidence of the equivocal effects of these deviations, with both positive and negative deviations motivating prosocial behaviors. The current research reconciles these competing findings by introducing construal as a moderator. Across four studies, the authors find that positive deviations from performance norms motivate prosocial behavior for independent donors, whereas negative deviations from performance norms motivate prosocial behavior for interdependent donors. They further show that these effects are driven by a prevention focus associated with interdependent consumers and a promotion focus associated with independent consumers. The article concludes with implications for the marketing of charities and prosocial behaviors.","Alexis M.

Might one's likelihood of agreeing to pursue a goal fluctuate even if nothing about the goal's objective features changes, but if instead the only change is in how the time allotted for goal pursuit is described? Seven experiments show that consumers are more likely to agree to pursue goals when the completion interval is described by duration (e.g., “within exactly two weeks from now”) instead of date (e.g., “between today and November 17”). This pattern may arise because dates, which may make it easier to retrieve competing obligations falling within the interval, lead people to focus more on the (unenjoyable) goal-pursuit process, whereas durations, which present the interval in isolation, allow people to focus more on the goal's (beneficial) outcome. These findings suggest that although how a time interval is described seems inconsequential, it has striking effects on goal-pursuit decisions and therefore has important implications for the marketing of products and actions designed to assist consumers in achieving their goals.","Nira Munichor, Robyn A.

They conjecture that consumers often hold expectations about the features that choice alternatives have in common, and they demonstrate that presenting (vs. omitting information about) a common feature increases the choice probability of the alternative that would have been expected to perform worse on the common feature, given its performance on differentiating features. This effect occurs because performance on the common feature is judged not at face value but relative to an expectation about which product should perform best on that feature. The effect holds even though performance on the common feature is clearly the same when alternatives are presented side by side. Finally, the authors demonstrate four boundary conditions of this effect.","Ioannis Evangelidis, Stijn M.J.

Firms' Strategic Leverage of Unplanned Exposure and Planned Advertising: An Analysis in the Context of Celebrity Endorsements,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.16.0260,01-Feb-18,01-Feb-18,55,1,14,34,"Using data on advertising and sales of an innovative piece of golf equipment and the performance of its celebrity endorsers, the authors build a discrete-choice model that incorporates consumer awareness and preferences.

Model estimates reveal that wins in professional golf tournaments (which proxy for unplanned television exposure during weekly golf tournaments) affect awareness and that paid planned advertising impacts awareness and preferences. Focusing on Titleist equipment, counterfactual analysis demonstrates that the unplanned media exposure and planned advertising account for 22% and 24% of sales, respectively. The results also suggest that firms would benefit from coordinating the two.

They find across multiple data sets that similarity based on overall utility, not just attributes, defines products as similar with heightened rates of substitution.

Nevertheless, there is limited understanding of how the effectiveness of direct marketing communications varies by value propositions. Typically, direct marketing efforts are geared toward explicitly featuring economic or relational values. To implement an effective communication strategy catering to customers' preferences, firms should understand how customers consistently evaluate these organizational marketing communications, which ultimately affect their buying behaviors. Therefore, the authors analyze marketing messages and employ content analysis to capture the two distinct types of direct marketing communications. Using data from a Fortune 500 business-to-business service firm and a robust econometric model, they find that the (1) effects of economic and relational marketing communication on customer purchase behaviors interplay and vary over time, (2) latent stock of direct marketing communication affects customer purchase behaviors, and (3) evolution of customers' perceived importance can be recovered using transaction data.

A retail field study demonstrates that male customers spend more money and purchase more expensive products than their female counterparts in the presence (vs. absence) of a physically dominant male employee. This effect has a more powerful impact on male customers who lack bodily markers of dominance (shorter stature or measures linked to lower levels of testosterone). When confronted with other physically dominant (vs. nondominant) men, these male customers are particularly prone to signal status through price or logo size. Their elevated feelings of intrasexual (male-to-male) competitiveness drive them to spend more money on status-signaling, but not functional, products and to prefer and draw larger brand logos. Because pictorial exposure is sufficient for the effect to occur, these findings are not limited to in-store interactions with dominant male employees but have broad implications for marketing and advertising.","Tobias Otterbring, Christine Ringler, Nancy J.

Retention Futility: Targeting High-Risk Customers Might be Ineffective,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.16.0163,01-Feb-18,01-Feb-18,55,1,80,98,"Companies in a variety of sectors are increasingly managing customer churn proactively, generally by detecting customers at the highest risk of churning and targeting retention efforts towards them. While there is a vast literature on developing churn prediction models that identify customers at the highest risk of churning, no research has investigated whether it is indeed optimal to target those individuals. Combining two field experiments with machine learning techniques, the author demonstrates that customers identified as having the highest risk of churning are not necessarily the best targets for proactive churn programs. This finding is not only contrary to common wisdom but also suggests that retention programs are sometimes futile not because firms offer the wrong incentives but because they do not apply the right targeting rules. Accordingly, firms should focus their modeling efforts on identifying the observed heterogeneity in response to the intervention and to target customers on the basis of their sensitivity to the intervention, regardless of their risk of churning. This approach is empirically demonstrated to be significantly more effective than the standard practice of targeting customers with the highest risk of churning. More broadly, the author encourages firms and researchers using randomized trials (or A/B tests) to look beyond the average effect of interventions and leverage the observed heterogeneity in customers' response to select customer targets.",Eva Ascarza,"churn/retention, proactive churn management, field experiments, heterogeneous treatment effect, machine learning",25
TV Viewing and Advertising Targeting,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0421,01-Feb-18,01-Feb-18,55,1,99,118,"Television, the predominant advertising medium, is being transformed by the microtargeting capabilities of set-top boxes (STBs). By procuring impressions at the STB level (often denoted “programmatic television”), advertisers can now lower per-exposure costs and/or reach viewers most responsive to advertising creatives. Accordingly, this study uses a proprietary, household-level, single-source data set to develop an instantaneous show and advertisement viewing model to forecast consumers' exposure to advertising and the downstream consequences for impressions and sales. Viewing data suggest that person-specific factors dwarf brand- or show-specific factors in explaining advertising avoidance, thereby suggesting that device-level advertising targeting can be more effective than existing show-level targeting. Consistent with this observation, the model indicates that microtargeting lowers advertising costs and raises incremental profits considerably relative to show-level targeting. Further, these advantages are amplified when advertisers can buy in real time as opposed to up front.","Yiting Deng, Carl F.

Results across seven studies demonstrate that when the concept of God is salient, consumer compliance and persuasion in response to fear appeals is dampened. Importantly, the results suggest that one reason for this persuasion-dampening effect of God salience is the fact that consumers associate the concept of God with the idea of unlimited support. Consistent with this, the results reveal that when God is not associated with the idea of support, the dampening effect of God salience on fear appeal compliance is eliminated.","Eugenia C.

How Customer Referral Programs Turn Social Capital into Economic Capital,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0653,01-Feb-18,01-Feb-18,55,1,132,146,"Customers acquired through a referral program have been observed to exhibit higher margins and lower churn than customers acquired through other means. Theory suggests two likely mechanisms for this phenomenon: (1) better matching between referred customers and the firm and (2) social enrichment by the referrer. The present study is the first to provide evidence of these two mechanisms in a customer referral program. Consistent with the theory that better matching affects contribution margins, (1) referrer–referral dyads exhibit shared unobservables in customer contribution margins, (2) referrers with more extensive experience bring in higher-margin referrals, and (3) this association between the referrer's experience and margin gap becomes smaller over the referral's lifetime. Consistent with the theory that social enrichment affects retention, referrals exhibit lower churn only as long as their referrer has not churned. These findings indicate that better matching and social enrichment are two mechanisms through which firms can leverage their customers' networks to gain new customers with higher customer lifetime value and convert social capital into economic capital. One recommendation for the managers of the firm studied is to recruit referrers among their customers who have been acquired at least six months ago, exhibit high margins, and are unlikely to churn.","Christophe Van Den Bulte, Emanuel Bayer, Bernd Skiera,...","customer referral programs, customer relationship marketing, referral marketing, social networks, word-of-mouth marketing",1

Mandatory endorsements boosted evaluations of policy-focused attack ads—those typically plagued by overcomeable skepticism—but had no consistent effect on positive or character-focused ads. Mandatory endorsements boost ad believability—largely outside of participants' awareness—for two reasons: (1) the tagline offers a legitimizing association with regulation and (2) the candidates' own personally delivered endorsement language offers an implicit promise of the ads' truth value.

The authors use the Elo algorithm, a statistical model calibrated on paired comparisons, to score the full set of ads on relative perceptions and click performance. The estimated scores validate the theoretical link between perceptions and performance. Second, the authors predict the perceptions and performance of new ads relative to the existing set using textual content metrics. The predictive model allows for direct effects and interactions of the text metrics, resulting in a “large p, small n” problem. They address this problem with a novel Bayesian implementation of the VANISH model, a penalized regression approach that allows for differential treatment of main and interaction effects, in a system of equations.

For consumers who have visited the firm's website in the previous four weeks (recent online consumers), the authors find evidence for a cross-campaign, brand-building effect of banner advertising, and TV ads also directly affect offline purchases. Overall, the findings indicate that for firms that predominantly (or even exclusively) sell offline, banner advertising is most suitable to generate awareness for a firm's new products among nonrecent online consumers, and to build their brand(s) among recent online consumers.","Lara Lobschat, Ernst C.

Positioning Multicountry Brands: The Impact of Variation in Cultural Values and Competitive Set,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0058,01-Dec-17,01-Dec-17,54,6,914,931,"Building on cultural values research, the authors identify specific image attributes on which multicountry brands should position themselves consistently across markets. Leveraging prior research, they identify three life values that are most equal (benevolence, universalism, and self-direction) and two that are least equal (power and hedonism) in cross-national importance. The authors link specific brand image attributes (e.g., friendly, social, elite style, arrogant) to these life values through empirical data and semantic analysis. Using an extensive field data set on consumer perceptions and preferences from 22 countries regarding more than 1,700 brands, the authors then show that greater global consistency of a brand's image decreases overall brand attitudes if the specific image attribute is one that is not equally desired worldwide. They also find that the attitudinal impact of a multicountry brand's positioning consistency on commonly valued image attributes is greater when the set of competitors the brand faces across its markets is more homogeneous. The authors discuss implications for global brand management theory and practice.","Rajeev Batra, Y. Charles Zhang, Nilüfer Z.

Analyzing Client Profitability across Diffusion Segments for a Continuous Innovation,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.16.0209,01-Dec-17,01-Dec-17,54,6,932,951,"While a time-based segmentation approach to customer segmentation for new products allows firms to identify consumers in the innovator and early adopter segments, this study adds a profitability-based perspective to generate new insights. Using six years of data on the adoption of technology services over three generations from a large technology manufacturer–service provider across seven countries, the authors provide empirical evidence that the short-term and long-term profitability per period of clients in the early majority segment is the highest, followed by the late majority, the innovators, the early adopters, and the laggards, respectively. While a time-based segmentation approach enables firms to identify consumers who are likely to adopt new products sooner than others, a profitability-based perspective can complement their targeting strategy and enhance overall profits. Managers can make informed decisions on investments required to develop new markets with better estimates of the profitability of consumers from later segments. Our study offers managers the necessary insights to develop a road map for identifying and targeting the most profitable clients.","Ashish Sood, V.

Franchisor–Franchisee Bankruptcy and the Efficacy of Franchisee Governance,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0182,01-Dec-17,01-Dec-17,54,6,952,967,"Franchisors’ long-term viability is tied to the ongoing operations of their franchisees. To ensure the ongoing performance of franchisees, franchisors deploy multiple governance mechanisms. This study assesses how governance mechanisms deployed to enhance franchisee ability (via selection and socialization) and motivation (via incentives and monitoring) impact franchisee bankruptcy. The authors examine the individual and joint effects of deploying governance mechanisms that share the same underlying objective, namely, to enhance franchisee ability and motivation. They also assess how motivation-inducing mechanisms may serve to counter the motivation-dampening effect of an increased royalty rate. Relying on data from multiple archival sources, the authors identify all bankruptcy filings by franchisees and their franchisors across 1,115 franchise systems over a 13-year observation window. Their findings document a positive and significant relationship between franchisee and franchisor bankruptcy. They also find main and interaction effects of the ability- and motivation-influencing governance mechanisms on the likelihood of franchisee bankruptcy, and the existence of significant bankruptcy spillovers among franchisees within the same franchise system. They discuss implications for franchise theory and management.","Kersi D. Antia, Sudha Mani, Kenneth H. Wathne","franchisor bankruptcy, franchisee bankruptcy, governance mechanisms, royalty rate",0
Demand for “Healthy” Products: False Claims and FTC Regulation,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0398,01-Dec-17,01-Dec-17,54,6,968,989,"Firms sometimes make selective or deceptive claims, which can have negative consequences for consumers, especially if consumers are not fully informed and the claims are hard to verify. This study aims to measure the decline in demand that a firm making such claims faces when caught. In addition, it seeks to understand which type of consumer these claims primarily affect. Using a panel data set of consumer purchases and firm advertising, the authors measure this impact by exploiting the fact that four popular products settled charges raised by the Federal Trade Commission. They further control for and document firm responses in terms of price and advertisement changes around the date of the settlement. Findings indicate a significant decline in demand following the termination of the claims, resulting in a 12%–67% monthly loss in revenue across the four products, which amounts to a $.40 million–$3.82 million loss in monthly revenue. They also find that these claims primarily affect consumers who are newcomers.","Anita Rao, Emily Wang","public policy, advertising, FTC, natural experiments, firm deception",2
A Meta-Analysis of Marketing Communication Carryover Effects,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0580,01-Dec-17,01-Dec-17,54,6,990,1008,"To optimally set marketing communication (“marcom”) budgets, reliable estimates of short-term elasticities and carryover effects are required. Empirical generalizations from meta-analyses of prior field studies can help guide these decisions. However, the last such meta-analysis of marcom carryover effects was performed on Koyck model–based estimates collected before 1984 and was confined to mass media advertising. The authors update and extend extant empirical generalizations via two meta-analyses of carryover estimates compiled from studies encompassing personal selling, targeted advertising, and mass media advertising, using diverse model forms, until 2015. The first is focused on and utilizes 918 estimates of the carryover proportion of the total effect, termed long-term share of the total effect, and the second focuses on 863 derivable estimates of 90% implied duration intervals. The authors find the mean long-term shares of the total effect for personal selling (.687) and targeted advertising (.650) are distinctly larger than that for mass media advertising (.523) and the corresponding median 90% implied duration intervals are 12.6, 2, and 3.4 months, respectively.

TV Channel Search and Commercial Breaks,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0121,01-Oct-17,01-Oct-17,54,5,671,686,"This study investigates time lapses that interrupt product consumption. Preeminent examples are commercial breaks during television or radio programming. The authors suggest that breaks facilitate consumers’ search for alternatives. Specifically, when there is so much uncertainty that consumers are unclear about utility levels of different products, they engage in costly search to resolve the uncertainty. For TV programming, breaks lower the opportunity cost of search, allowing the consumer to sample alternative channels without further interrupting the viewing experience on the current channel. Using data from the Chinese TV market, the authors estimate a sequential search model to study consumer TV channel choice behavior. The data contain a quasi-natural experiment due to a Chinese government policy change on commercial breaks. The natural experiment creates exogenous variations in the data that enable the empirical identification of heterogeneous consumer preference and search cost. The data patterns support the idea that viewers search for alternatives during commercial breaks. Drawing on the estimates, the authors investigate how the timing of breaks affects TV channels’ viewership, offering insights about how to strategically adjust the timing of breaks.","Song Yao, Wenbo Wang, Yuxin Chen","advertising, television, consumer search, natural experiment, demand estimation",1
The Rise of the Sharing Economy: Estimating the Impact of Airbnb on the Hotel Industry,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0204,01-Oct-17,01-Oct-17,54,5,687,705,"Peer-to-peer markets, collectively known as the sharing economy, have emerged as alternative suppliers of goods and services traditionally provided by long-established industries. The authors explore the economic impact of the sharing economy on incumbent firms by studying the case of Airbnb, a prominent platform for short-term accommodations. They analyze Airbnb's entry into the state of Texas and quantify its impact on the Texas hotel industry over the subsequent decade. In Austin, where Airbnb supply is highest, the causal impact on hotel revenue is in the 8%–10% range; moreover, the impact is nonuniform, with lower-priced hotels and hotels that do not cater to business travelers being the most affected. The impact manifests itself primarily through less aggressive hotel room pricing, benefiting all consumers, not just participants in the sharing economy. The price response is especially pronounced during periods of peak demand, such as during the South by Southwest festival, and is due to a differentiating feature of peer-to-peer platforms—enabling instantaneous supply to scale to meet demand.","Georgios Zervas, Davide Proserpio, John W.

Can Offline Stores Drive Online Sales?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0518,01-Oct-17,01-Oct-17,54,5,706,719,"The authors use evidence from store openings by a bricks-and-clicks retailer to examine the drivers of substitution and complementarity between online and offline retail channels. The evidence supports the coexistence of substitution across channels and complementarity in demand. In places where the retailer has a strong presence, the opening of an offline store is associated with a decrease in online sales and search; however, in places where the retailer does not have a strong presence, the opening of an offline store is associated with an increase in online sales and search. The evidence suggests that whereas online and offline channels may be substitutes in distribution, they are complements in marketing communications. Specifically, the type of marketing communication driving complementarity seems to be information about the existence of the brand. For example, the authors observe a large increase in new customer acquisition and sales, and little difference between fit and feel products and other products. Thus, it is the presence of the store, rather than information about the attributes of the products in the store, that drives complementarity.","Kitty Wang, Avi Goldfarb","channels/distribution, integrated marketing, online/offline, informative advertising",132
Predicting the Consequences of Marketing Policy Changes: A New Data Enrichment Method with Competitive Reactions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0498,01-Oct-17,01-Oct-17,54,5,720,736,"This article introduces a new data enrichment method that combines revealed data on consumer demand and competitive reactions with stated data on competitive reactions to yet-to-be-enacted, unprecedented marketing policy changes. The authors extend the data enrichment literature to include stated competitive reactions, collected from subject-matter experts through a conjoint experiment. The authors apply their method to investigate hypothetical and unprecedented sales force policy changes of pharmaceutical companies. The results from the data enrichment method have high face validity and lead to various unique insights compared with using revealed data only. The authors find that only a very large sales force decrease initiated by the market leader triggers all competitors to decrease their sales force as well, leading to substantial profit increases for each firm. With respect to sales force allocation, when competitors decrease their sales force, they mainly decrease the reach of detailing across doctors, rather than decreasing the number of details to the most-visited doctors. The proposed data enrichment method provides managers with a powerful tool to, ex ante, predict the consequences of unprecedented marketing policy changes.","Eelco Kappe, Sriram Venkataraman, Stefan Stremersch","data enrichment, marketing policy, sales force management, competitive reactions, pharmaceutical",0
Seller Beware: How Bundling Affects Valuation,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0277,01-Oct-17,01-Oct-17,54,5,737,751,"How does bundling affect valuation? This research proposes the asymmetry hypothesis in the valuation of bundles: consumers demand more compensation for the loss of items from bundles, compared with the loss of the same items in isolation, yet they express lower willingness to pay for items added to bundles, compared with the same items purchased separately. This asymmetry persists because bundling causes consumers to perceive multiple items as a single, inseparable gestalt unit. Thus, consumers resist altering the “whole” of the bundle by removing or adding items. Six studies demonstrate this asymmetry across judgments of monetary value (Studies 1 and 2) and (dis)satisfaction (Study 3). Moreover, bundle composition—the ability of different items to create the impression of a “whole”—moderates the effect of bundling on valuation (Study 4), and the need to replace missing items (i.e., restoring the “whole”) mediates the effect of bundling on compensation demanded for losses (Study 5). Finally, the authors explore a boundary condition: the effect is attenuated for items that complete a set (Study 6).","Franklin Shaddy, Ayelet Fishbach","bundling, pricing, gestalt, satisfaction",10
Building Agent-Based Decision Support Systems for Word-of-Mouth Programs: A Freemium Application,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0443,01-Oct-17,01-Oct-17,54,5,752,767,"Marketers must constantly decide how to implement word-of-mouth (WOM) programs, and a well-developed decision support system (DSS) can provide them valuable assistance in doing so.

The framework presents a set of guidelines and recommendations to (1) involve stakeholders, (2) follow a data-driven iterative modeling approach, (3) increase validity through automated calibration, and (4) understand the DSS behavior. This framework is applied to build a DSS for a freemium app in which premium users discuss the product with their social network and promote its viral adoption. After its validation, the agent-based DSS forecasts the aggregate number of premium sales over time and the most likely users to become premium in the near future. The experiments show how the DSS can help managers by forecasting premium conversions and increasing the number of premiums through targeting and implementing reward policies.","Manuel Chica, William Rand","word of mouth, marketing decision support systems, agent-based modeling, targeting and referrals, freemium business model",21
“Be Careless with That!” Availability of Product Upgrades Increases Cavalier Behavior toward Possessions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0131,01-Oct-17,01-Oct-17,54,5,768,784,"Consumers are often faced with the opportunity to purchase a new, enhanced product, such as a new phone, even though the product they currently own is still fully functional. The authors propose that consumers act more recklessly with their current products when in the presence of appealing, though not yet attained, product upgrades (not just mere replacements). Carelessness and neglect toward currently owned products stem from a desire to justify the attainment of upgrades without appearing wasteful. A series of studies with actual owners of a wide range of different goods (durable, consumable, functional, and hedonic products) and evidence from a real-word data set of lost Apple iPhones demonstrate how the availability of product upgrades increases cavalier behavior toward possessions. Moreover, the authors demonstrate that product neglect in the presence of attractive upgrades can occur without deliberate intentions. Finally, theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are discussed.","Silvia Bellezza, joshua M. Ackerman, Francesca Gino","carelessness, product upgrade, ownership, justification",332

The authors conceptualize jilting as a multi-stage process, which consists of a pre-jilt anticipatory phase that is initiated on the introduction of an aspirant option and a post-jilt phase that is initiated when the aspirant option becomes inaccessible. They show that during the anticipatory phase, a process of denigration specific to the incumbent option is engendered. The subsequent jilt elicits a negative emotional response. During the affectively charged post-jilt phase, preference shifts away from the now-denigrated incumbent option, yielding a jilting effect. In four field and laboratory studies, the authors establish this jilting effect, rule out alternative accounts, and discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of the findings.","Aaron M.

Interpreting the Stock Returns to New Product Announcements: How the past Shapes Investors’ Expectations of the Future,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0119,01-Oct-17,01-Oct-17,54,5,799,815,"Investors routinely follow firms’ communications and actions to form expectations about the firms’ future performance. The authors propose a set of firm and industry characteristics that influence the formation of investor expectations in the context of new product announcements. Specifically, they argue that positive expectations of future innovation output should cause an ex-ante increase in stock prices and a smaller ex-post market reaction when an actual new product is announced. Using a sample of 4,865 new product announcements made by 826 publicly traded U.S. firms, the authors show that the stock market reaction to a new product announcement measured in a five-day window around the announcement is negatively related to (1) the number of new products previously announced by the firm, (2) the average number of new products previously announced by the firm's competitors, and (3) the average sentiment of past public news about the firm. These three factors are also positively related to the market value of the firm measured immediately before each new announcement, controlling for increases in firm value directly attributable to past new product announcements. In contrast to many articles in the marketing literature that imply that the added value of a marketing event can be fully assessed from the stock market reaction to the announcement of the event, the authors clarify that for recurrent events or events that are part of a firm's broader strategy, this reaction reflects only an update of investors’ expectations of future firm performance.","Nooshin L.

Five studies show that the effect is robust across different types of tasks (e.g., persistence tasks, concentration tasks, agility tasks). The evidence further shows that the effect is not due to changes in product efficacy beliefs, feelings of competence, feelings of accomplishment, mood, task desirability, goal activation, or goal attainability. Instead, the self-expressive customization of a product extends an identity (e.g., personal identity, group identity) into the product. When the product is subsequently used to pursue a goal whose desired outcome can affirm the extended identity, performance improves.","Ulrike Kaiser, Martin Schreier, Chris Janiszewski","product customization, motivation, goal pursuit, individuality, identity",9

They account for salesperson heterogeneity using a hierarchical Bayesian framework to estimate the model. They find conditional compensation in the form of quota bonus incentives to improve performance; however, such compensation may lead to lower future performance. The authors find little difference in effectiveness between a quota bonus plan and punitive bonus plans framed as a penalty for not achieving quota. They find that unconditional compensation, in the form of reciprocity, is effective at improving sales force performance only when it is given as a delayed reward; however, the effectiveness of this plan decreases with repeated exposure. The authors also find heterogeneity in the impact of compensation on performance across salespeople, such that unconditional compensation is more effective for salespeople with high base performance, whereas conditional compensation is equally effective across all types of salespeople.","Doug J.

Although innovation scholars have begun to analyze the objective promise of crowdsourcing, the current research is unique in pointing out that merely marketing the source of design to customers might bring about an incremental increase in product sales. The findings from two randomized field experiments reveal that labeling crowdsourced new products as such—that is, marketing the product as “customer-ideated” at the point of purchase versus not mentioning the specific source of design—increased the product's actual market performance by up to 20%. Two controlled follow-up studies reveal that the effect observed in two distinct consumer goods domains (food and electronics) can be attributed to a quality inference: consumers perceive “customer-ideated” products to be based on ideas that address their needs more effectively, and the corresponding design mode is considered superior in generating promising new products.","Hidehiko Nishikawa, Martin Schreier, Christoph Fuchs,...","crowdsourcing, idea generation, user involvement, new products, customer-centric innovation",46

Comparison Neglect in Upgrade Decisions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0394,01-Aug-17,01-Aug-17,54,4,556,571,"To properly evaluate a potential product upgrade, consumers should compare the upgraded option with the product they already own to assess the upgrade's added utility. However, although consumers explicitly and spontaneously acknowledge the importance of comparing the upgrade with the status quo, the authors find that they often fail to do so. Consequently, consumers frequently buy product upgrades that they would not have bought had they followed their own advice. Five experiments, involving both real and hypothetical upgrade decisions, show that even when the status quo option is represented in the decision context, if consumers are not explicitly prompted to reflect on it or compare it with the upgraded option, they often do not compare it with the upgrade and thus show an elevated likelihood of upgrading. The experiments suggest that this “comparison neglect” increases upgrade likelihood by making people overlook the similarities between the upgraded and status quo options and that it persists even when deliberation effort is high. The findings have important implications for theory, marketing practice, and consumer welfare.","Aner Sela, Robyn A.

How Language Shapes Word of Mouth's Impact,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0248,01-Aug-17,01-Aug-17,54,4,572,588,"Word of mouth affects consumer behavior, but how does the language used in word of mouth shape that impact? Might certain types of consumers be more likely to use certain types of language, affecting whose words have more influence? Five studies, including textual analysis of more than 1,000 online reviews, demonstrate that compared to more implicit endorsements (e.g., “I liked it,” “I enjoyed it”), explicit endorsements (e.g., “I recommend it”) are more persuasive and increase purchase intent. This occurs because explicit endorsers are perceived to like the product more and have more expertise. Looking at the endorsement language consumers actually use, however, shows that while consumer knowledge does affect endorsement style, its effect actually works in the opposite direction. Because novices are less aware that others have heterogeneous product preferences, they are more likely to use explicit endorsements. Consequently, the endorsement styles novices and experts tend to use may lead to greater persuasion by novices. These findings highlight the important role that language, and endorsement styles in particular, plays in shaping the effects of word of mouth.","Grant Packard, Jonah Berger","word of mouth, language, persuasion, consumer knowledge, social perception",47
Rejecting Responsibility: Low Physical Involvement in Obtaining Food Promotes Unhealthy Eating,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0125,01-Aug-17,01-Aug-17,54,4,589,604,"Five experiments show that less physical involvement in obtaining food leads to less healthy food choices.

Further, when participants are given the opportunity to choose their portion size, they select larger portions of unhealthy foods when less (vs. more) physical involvement is required to help themselves to the food; again, this is not the case for healthy foods. The authors suggest that this behavior occurs because being less physically involved in serving one's food allows participants to reject responsibility for unhealthy eating and thus to feel better about themselves after indulgent consumption.

The authors also posit that preferences for beautiful recipients are most likely to emerge when decisions are intuitive, whereas preferences for needy recipients are most likely to emerge when decisions are deliberative. These propositions are tested in several ways. First, when a beautiful recipient is included in basic choice sets, this recipient becomes the most popular option and increases donor satisfaction. Second, heightening deliberation steers choices away from beautiful recipients and toward needier ones. Third, donors explicitly state that they “want” to give to beautiful recipients but “should” give to less beautiful, needier ones.

Acknowledging this is a first exploratory attempt to test such relationships using correlational analyses, the authors uncover several key findings. First, whereas cumulative overall variety was not associated with weight loss, daily overall variety was positively associated with weight loss. Second, this relationship was strongest for variety during breakfast and afternoon snacks and was particularly driven by consuming greater vegetable variety.

Do Costly Options Lead to Better Outcomes?

Such cost–benefit heuristics in goal pursuit have been observed across several domains, but their antecedents have not been fully explored. In this research, the authors propose that a person's tendency to use cost–benefit heuristics depends on the extent to which that person subscribes to the Protestant Work Ethic (PWE), an influential concept originally introduced to explain the rise of capitalism. The PWE is a core value predicated on the work-specific belief that hard work leads to success, but people who subscribe strongly to it tend to overgeneralize and align other work-unrelated cognitions for consistency. Across ten studies (N = 1,917) measuring and manipulating PWE, robust findings show that people who are high (vs. low) in PWE are more likely to use cost–benefit heuristics and are more likely to choose costlier means in pursuit of superior outcomes. Suggestions are provided for how marketers may identify consumers high versus low in PWE and tailor their offerings accordingly.","Yimin Cheng, Anirban Mukhopadhyay, Rom Y.

Mobility of Top Marketing and Sales Executives in Business-to-Business Markets: A Social Network Perspective,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0124,01-Aug-17,01-Aug-17,54,4,650,670,"In business-to-business markets, top marketing and sales executives (TMSEs) have considerable influence on their organizations’ customer strategies. When TMSEs switch firms, a pattern of informal organizational connections results; this pattern reflects the flow of information and knowledge among firms and creates managerial social capital in the process. To model this information flow, the current study considers information reach and richness, conceptualized according to the network position (i.e., centrality and brokerage) of the firm in the TMSE mobility network, which can be constructed by tracing executive movements through the work experience records of TMSEs in an industry. TMSE tenure (i.e., time with the firm) and firm market orientation constitute critical moderators, which capture motivation and ability at the individual and firm level, respectively. Data from the semiconductor industry and a model that corrects for unobserved heterogeneity and endogeneity suggest that managerial social capital enhances firm performance; however, TMSE tenure and firm market orientation are essential for absorbing the benefits of managerial social capital.","Rui Wang, Aditya Gupta, Rajdeep Grewal","chief marketing officer tenure, executive affiliations, managerial social capital, motivation–ability, social network",0
Beyond the Target Customer: Social Effects of Customer Relationship Management Campaigns,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0442,01-Jun-17,01-Jun-17,54,3,347,363,"Customer relationship management (CRM) campaigns have traditionally focused on maximizing the profitability of the targeted customers. The authors demonstrate that in business settings characterized by network externalities, a CRM campaign that is aimed at changing the behavior of specific customers propagates through the social network, thereby also affecting the behavior of nontargeted customers. Using a randomized field experiment involving nearly 6,000 customers of a mobile telecommunication provider, they find that the social connections of targeted customers increase their consumption and become less likely to churn, due to a campaign that was neither targeted at them nor offered them any direct incentives. The authors estimate a social multiplier of 1.28. That is, the effect of the campaign on first-degree connections of targeted customers is 28% of the effect of the campaign on the targeted customers. By further leveraging the randomized experimental design, the authors show that, consistent with a network externality account, the increase in activity among the nontargeted but connected customers is driven by the increase in communication between the targeted customers and their connections, making the local network of the nontargeted customers more valuable. These findings suggest that in targeting CRM marketing campaigns, firms should consider not only the profitability of the targeted customer but also the potential spillover of the campaign to nontargeted but connected customers.","Eva Ascarza, Peter Ebbes, Oded Netzer,...","social effects, network effects, field experiment, mobile",438
Social Interactions and Monetary Incentives in Driving Consumer Repeat Behavior,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0482,01-Jun-17,01-Jun-17,54,3,364,380,"Companies are eager to leverage social interactions among consumers by embedding social networking tools on their websites and actively integrating marketing actions with consumers' social activities. In this article, the authors investigate the impact of online social interactions on repeat usage behavior and the effectiveness of monetary incentives by formulating a model that parses out the effects of these individual factors. Using a unique data set from a wellness program, they find that online social interactions play a key role in driving repeat behavior, and after controlling for contemporaneous correlations from same-office friends, the social influence emanates even from distant friends working in different offices. The authors also find that monetary incentives have a significant impact on repeat usage and that ignoring this may overstate the impact of social influence. Furthermore, what-if scenario analyses show that social interactions are more effective than monetary incentives when both are present. The authors then explore social influence theories to understand the underlying process mechanisms that may operate in the repeat usage context. Using these findings, they offer strategic implications for marketing practice.","Kamer Toker-Yildiz, Minakshi Trivedi, Jeonghye Choi,...","social interactions, repeat usage, online networking, monetary incentives, reward programs",0
Why Do Salespeople Quit? An Empirical Examination of Own and Peer Effects on Salesperson Turnover Behavior,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0485,01-Jun-17,01-Jun-17,54,3,381,397,"Salesperson turnover can have a negative overall effect on a firm. Research on salesperson turnover has conceptually studied the consequences of voluntary turnover on a firm. However, little empirical research has investigated the antecedents of salesperson turnover—specifically, the role of own effects (relative performance, customer satisfaction, and goal realization) and peer effects (peer performance variance and turnover). Therefore, the authors propose a framework to assess the influence of own factors (through identity theory) and of peer factors (through social identity theory) on salesperson turnover. Using a proportional hazard model implemented on data consisting of 6,727 salespeople over two years, the results suggest that in addition to own behaviors, managers need to pay attention to peer behaviors because peer turnover (voluntary and involuntary) greatly increases a salesperson's turnover probability. Furthermore, the results indicate that peer effects have a greater impact than own effects. This research has implications for sales force management because it helps managers (1) identify a salesperson's turnover risk, (2) diagnose the drivers of turnover behavior, and (3) build strategies to prevent salesperson turnover.","Sarang Sunder, V.

Extracting Summary Piles from Sorting Task Data,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0388,01-Jun-17,01-Jun-17,54,3,398,414,"In a sorting task, consumers receive a set of representational items (e.g., products, brands) and sort them into piles such that the items in each pile “go together.” The sorting task is flexible in accommodating different instructions and has been used for decades in exploratory marketing research in brand positioning and categorization. However, no general analytic procedures yet exist for analyzing sorting task data without performing arbitrary transformations to the data that influence the results and insights obtained. This manuscript introduces a flexible framework for analyzing sorting task data, as well as a new optimization approach to identify summary piles, which provide an easy way to explore associations consumers make among a set of items. Using two Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application of single-serving snacks from a local retailer, the authors demonstrate that the resulting procedure is scalable, can provide additional insights beyond those offered by existing procedures, and requires mere minutes of computational time.","Simon J.

Time Preferences and Mortgage Choice,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0481,01-Jun-17,01-Jun-17,54,3,415,429,"Mortgage decisions have important consequences for consumers, lenders, and the state of the economy more generally. Mortgage decisions are also prototypical of consumer financial choices that involve a stream of expenditures and consumption occurring across time. The authors use heterogeneity in time preferences for both immediate (present bias) and long-term outcomes to explain a sequence of mortgage decisions, including mortgage choice and the decision to abandon a mortgage. The authors employ an analytic model and a survey of mortgaged households augmented by zip code–level house price and foreclosure data. The model suggests and data confirm that consumers with greater present bias and long-term discounting tend to choose mortgages that minimize up-front costs. However, greater present bias decreases homeowners' willingness to abandon a mortgage, locking them into the contract. Long-term patience increases mortgage abandonment. This reversal across mortgage decisions is difficult for alternative accounts to explain. These results suggest that a two-parameter model of time preferences is helpful for understanding how homeowners make mortgage decisions.","Stephen A. Atlas, Eric J. Johnson, John W.

Within this context, the authors address two integrated topics that have received scant attention: the efficient design of choice experiments and the analysis of data that arises from a selective choice process. The authors propose a new dual-objective compound design criterion that incorporates prior information for the joint purpose of efficiently estimating the effects of the active attributes and detecting the effects of attributes labeled as inactive that may turn out to be active. The approach leverages self-stated auxiliary data as prior information both for individual-level customized design construction and in a heterogeneous variable selection model. The authors demonstrate the efficiency advantages of the approach relative to design benchmarks and highlight practical implications using both simulated data and actual data from a conjoint choice experiment in which individual designs were customized instantaneously using self-stated active-inactive attribute status.","Ty Henderson, Qing Liu","variable selection, selective choice process, customized conjoint choice designs, compound design criterion, heterogeneous variable selection model",0

Results of a field study using Apple's App Store, a follow-up survey, and two laboratory experiments provide consistent evidence for the predicted pattern. In addition, the results suggest that the nonlinear effect is explained in part by perceptions of reviewer effort and that the effect is stronger for products that are utilitarian in nature.

Turning off the Lights: Consumers' Environmental Efforts Depend on Visible Efforts of Firms,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0441,01-Jun-17,01-Jun-17,54,3,478,494,"Firms can save considerable money if consumers conserve resources (e.g., if hotel patrons turn off the lights when leaving the room, if restaurant patrons use fewer paper napkins, if airline passengers clean up after themselves). In two studies conducted in real-world hotels, the authors show that consumers' conservation behavior is affected by the extent to which consumers perceive the firm as being green. Furthermore, consumer perceptions of firms' greenness and consumer conservation behavior depend on (1) whether the firm asks consumers to conserve resources, (2) the firm's own commitment to the environment, and (3) the firm's price image. In addition, firm requests to consumers to save resources can create consumer reactance and can backfire when firms themselves do not engage in visible costly environmental efforts. Such reactance is more likely for firms with a high-price image. Finally, the authors show that by spending a little money to signal environmental commitment, firms can save even more money through consumers' conservation of resources, resulting in wins for the firm, the consumer, and the environment.","Wenbo Wang, Aradhna Krishna, Brent McFerran","sustainability, green marketing, corporate social responsibility, price image, field experiment",85

The authors offer a possible solution to this challenge: the emergency reserve, or slack with a cost. They demonstrate how an explicitly defined emergency reserve not only is preferred over other options for goal-related programs but can also lead to increased persistence. Study 1 demonstrates that consumers prefer programs with emergency reserves to programs that do not have them, and Study 2 further clarifies that consumers' preference for an emergency reserve depends on the presence of a superordinate goal. Study 3 reveals that consumers prefer goals with emergency reserves because they perceive them to have both higher attainability and value than other goals. Study 4 demonstrates that reserves can lead to increased goal persistence in a realistic task that involves persistence over time. Finally, Studies 5 and 6 reveal that consumers persist more with reserve goals because they want to avoid using the “emergency” reserve.","Marissa A. Sharif, Suzanne B.

Specifically, the author demonstrates how both advertising and price elasticities and observed advertising and prices evolve along these cycles for a unique set of 252 brands—ranging from high-advertising, high-priced “premium mass” brands to low-advertising, low-priced “value niche” brands—in 61 consumer packaged goods categories. Overall, both advertising efectiveness and observed advertising are found to be stronger at demand peaks. Surprisingly, consumer reactions to price decreases are weaker at demand peaks, whereas reactions to price increases remain unchanged.

Uncovering the Importance of Relationship Characteristics in Social Networks: Implications for Seeding Strategies,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0511,01-Apr-17,01-Apr-17,54,2,187,201,"Seeding influential social network members is crucial for the success of a viral marketing campaign and product diffusion. In line with the assumption that connections between customers in social networks are binary (either present or absent), previous research has generally recommended seeding network members who are well-connected. However, the importance of connections between customers varies substantially depending on the relationship's characteristics, such as its type (i.e., friend, colleague, or acquaintance), duration, and interaction intensity. This research introduces a new Bayesian methodology to identify influential network members and takes into account the relative influence of different relationship characteristics on product diffusion. Two applications of the proposed methodology—the launch of a microfinance program across 43 Indian villages and information propagation in a large online social network—demonstrate the importance of weighting connections in social networks. Compared with traditional seeding strategies, the proposed methodology recommends substantially different sets of seeds that increased the reach by up to 10% in the first empirical application and up to 92% in the second.","Xi Chen, Ralf Van Der Lans, Tuan Q.

To this end, the authors obtain six months of data on daily impressions, clicks, targeting, and ad creative content from a major U.S. retailer, and they develop a dynamic zero-inflated count model. Given the sparse, nonlinear, and non-Gaussian nature of the data, the study designs a particle filter/Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme for estimation. Results show that carry-over rates for dynamic formats are greater than those for static formats; however, static formats can still be effective for price ads and retargeting. Most notably, results also show that retargeted ads are effective only if they offer price incentives. The study then considers the import of these results for the retailer's media schedules.","Norris I. Bruce, B.P.S. Murthi, Ram C.

Influencing Acquisition Performance in High-Technology Industries: The Role of Innovation and Relational Overlap,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0556,01-Apr-17,01-Apr-17,54,2,219,238,"Acquisition is an important activity that enables firms to adapt their resource configurations. Acquisition literature has focused only on the levels of innovation or relational resources, the primary dimensions of organizational resource bases. The authors argue that in addition to the levels, the degree of overlap between the acquiring and target firms, in terms of innovation and relational resources, should influence acquisitions. Furthermore, they argue for the importance of the quality of the target's resources along with factors influencing the acquirer's absorptive capacity (e.g., the chief executive officer's [CEO's] functional background and the acquiring firm's marketing intensity and acquisition experience) as contingencies. Using 319 biopharmaceutical acquisitions and a random-effect regression model that accounts for unobserved heterogeneity and the endogeneity of relational and innovation overlap, the authors find that innovation overlap has a positive effect, whereas relational overlap has a negative effect, on acquisition outcomes. Furthermore, the acquirer CEO's throughput background and acquisition experience negatively moderate, whereas the target's innovation resource quality and the acquirer's marketing intensity positively moderate, the influence of innovation overlap. The target's relational resource quality and the acquirer CEO's throughput background positively moderate the influence of relational overlap.","Alok R.

Do Disclosures of Customer Metrics Lower Investors’ and Analysts’ Uncertainty but Hurt Firm Performance?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0028,01-Apr-17,01-Apr-17,54,2,239,259,"Investors, analysts, and regulators frequently advocate greater disclosure of nonfinancial information, such as customer metrics.

To examine these counterarguments, this study presents the first empirical examination of the prevalence and consequences of backward- and forward-looking disclosures of customer metrics by manually coding 511 annual reports of firms in two industries, telecommunications (365 reports) and airlines (146 reports). The results reveal significant heterogeneity in the disclosure of customer metrics across firms and between industries. On average, in both industries, firms make more backward-looking than forward-looking disclosures. Notably, forward-looking disclosures of customer metrics are negatively associated with investors’ uncertainty in both industries and with analysts’ uncertainty in the telecommunications industry.

This impact is weakened, however, when CEOs have low power, when a high proportion of their compensation comes from equity, when the marketing department has high influence in the top management team, and when the economy is growing. Liberal CEOs’ greater rate of NPIs is associated with superior Tobin's q but also higher stock return volatility. Findings based on observations of 421 publicly listed U.S. firms from 2006 to 2010 provide considerable support for the authors’ hypotheses.

Tipping the Scale: The Role of Discriminability in Conjoint Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0659,01-Apr-17,01-Apr-17,54,2,279,292,"Conjoint analysis is a widely used method for determining how much certain attributes matter to consumers by observing a series of their choices. However, how those attributes are expressed has important consequences for their choices and thus for conclusions drawn by market researchers about attribute importance. Expanded attribute scales (e.g., expressing exercise time in minutes) leads consumers to perceive greater differences between scale levels than contracted scales (e.g., expressing exercise time in hours). The authors show in two domains that simply expanding an attribute's scale can shift choice toward alternatives that perform well on a scale that is expanded and thus can impact conjoint results such as attribute importance and screening. Thus, practitioners should take care when they choose precisely how to elicit preferences or how to describe their products: the extent of the scale's expansion will determine researchers’ inferences about the importance of the attribute it describes. By illustrating the curvilinear relationship between scale expansion and multiple measures, the authors also offer practitioners some insight into the limits of scale expansion.","Anocha Aribarg, Katherine A.

The Effect of Recycling versus Trashing on Consumption: Theory and Experimental Evidence,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.15.0574,01-Apr-17,01-Apr-17,54,2,293,305,"This article proposes a utilitarian model in which recycling could reduce consumers’ negative emotions from wasting resources (i.e., taking more resources than what is being consumed) and increase consumers’ positive emotions from disposing of consumed resources. The authors provide evidence for each component of the utility function using a series of choice problems and formulate hypotheses on the basis of a parsimonious utilitarian model. Experiments with real disposal behavior support the model hypotheses. The findings suggest that the positive emotions associated with recycling can overpower the negative emotions associated with wasting. As a result, consumers could use a larger amount of resources when recycling is an option, and more strikingly, this amount could go beyond the point at which their marginal consumption utility becomes zero. The authors extend the theoretical model and introduce acquisition utility and the moderating effect of the costs of recycling (financial, physical, and mental). From a policy perspective, this research argues for a better understanding of consumers’ disposal behavior to increase the effectiveness of environmental policies and campaigns.","Monic Sun, Remi Trudel","behavioral economics, sustainability, recycling, disposal, self-conscious emotions",181

Importantly, these likes are found to be most effective when the Facebook page is used as a platform for firm-initiated promotional communications. No effect of acquired page likes is found when customers interact organically with the firm's page, but a significant effect is found when the firm pays to boost its page posts and thus uses its Facebook page as a platform for paid advertising.

Valuable Virality,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0350,01-Apr-17,01-Apr-17,54,2,318,330,"Given recent interest in social media, many brands now create content that they hope consumers will view and share with peers. While some campaigns indeed go “viral,” their value to the brand is limited if they do not boost brand evaluation or increase purchase. Consequently, a key question is how to create valuable virality, or content that is not only shared but also beneficial to the brand. Share data from hundreds of real online ads, as well as controlled laboratory experiments, demonstrate that compared with informative appeals (which focus on product features), emotional appeals (which use drama, mood, music, and other emotion-eliciting strategies) are more likely to be shared. Informative appeals, in contrast, boost brand evaluations and purchase because the brand is an integral part of the ad content. By combining the benefits of both approaches, emotional brand-integral ads boost sharing while also bolstering brand-related outcomes. The authors’ framework sheds light on how companies can generate valuable virality and the mechanisms underlying these effects.","Ezgi Akpinar, Jonah Berger","viral marketing, social transmission, online content, advertising",25

Through six studies, the authors find that when associated with a product, lower pitch in voice or music leads consumers to infer a larger product size. Furthermore, evidence shows that this pitch–size effect occurs through a process of visual mental imagery, which can be facilitated through stronger visualization cues delivered via auditory channels and reduced when size perceptions are assessed directly in the presence of visual product information. The cross-modal effects between auditory stimuli and physical products represent an unexplored influence on consumer perception and behavior with important managerial and theoretical implications.","Michael L.

In the first module, the author identifies cycles by pattern-matching the amplitude and length of cycles observed to a user-specified definition. In the second module, the author defines the conditional monotonicity property, derives conditions under which a data-generating process satisfies it, and demonstrates its role in generating cycles. A key challenge in estimating this model is the presence of endogenous lagged dependent variables, which the author addresses using system generalized method of moments estimators. Third, the author presents methods that exploit the longitudinal and geographic variations in agents' economic and cultural capital to examine the different theories of fashion.

Empirical analyses of the large customer database of a Fortune 500 retailer reveal that a 1% desired change in the different types of recurring customer behaviors corresponds to a future quarterly 4.61% decrease in the cash flow volatility and $39.42 million increase in the future cash flow level of the firm. Furthermore, firm-initiated marketing is 1.9–3.2 times more effective at managing the future cash flow level and volatility when it is selectively targeted to customers with certain characteristics.

How Does Team Composition Affect Effort in Contests?

And how may the effect of team composition on effort depend on the type of contest the teams are competing in? Using a game-theoretic model, we derive the very sharp predictions that when winning the contest depends on the average team sales, the ability composition of a team has no effect on team effort, and the stronger and weaker members will expend identical effort levels. However, when the contest winner is determined by the minimum or maximum output contribution within the team, heterogeneity in team composition exerts a deleterious effect on team effort, with the stronger and weaker members expending unequal effort. Our model also shows that in a contest between two symmetric teams, when team members are homogeneous, all three contest metrics yield identical team effort; however, when team members are heterogeneous, the average metric elicits the highest team effort. We also discuss cases when the minimum and maximum metrics are optimal. We test the model's empirical validity using two incentive-aligned experiments in which participants make effort decisions strategically. The experimental results exhibit broad support for the theoretical predictions.","Hua Chen, Noah Lim","sales contests, strategic alliances, tournaments, team incentives, experimental economics",0
Clicks as a Healthy Alternative to Bricks: How Online Grocery Shopping Reduces Vice Purchases,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0490,01-Feb-17,01-Feb-17,54,1,61,74,"Although consumers are concerned about their health, obesity statistics suggest that contextual factors often lead them to choose unhealthy alternatives (i.e., vices) rather than healthy ones (i.e., virtues).

A database study and three lab experiments demonstrate that consumers choose relatively fewer vices in the online shopping environment. Moreover, this shopping channel effect arises because online channels present products symbolically, whereas offline stores present them physically. A symbolic presentation mode decreases the products' vividness, which in turn diminishes consumers' desire to seek instant gratification and ultimately leads them to purchase fewer vices. These findings highlight several unexplored differences between online and offline shopping, with important implications for consumers, public policy makers, and retailers.","Elke Huyghe, Julie Verstraeten, Maggie Geuens,...","grocery shopping, unhealthy food choices, product presentation, shopping channel, instant gratification",26

Return on Service Amenities,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0364,01-Feb-17,01-Feb-17,54,1,96,110,"Firms often vie for competitive advantage by providing additional services (amenities)to their customers. Although extant research has focused on the effect of adding amenities on choice, return on service amenities may arise from two sources: increased initial choice and increased revenues from repurchase. The authors develop a return on investment (ROI) model to capture how service amenities produce financial return from these two sources. They apply the model to hotel amenities, using a discrete choice experiment and a large-scale customer database developed in collaboration with a multibrand global hotel company. The authors employ a hierarchical Bayesian formulation to estimate the parameters. They use the estimation results to compare ROI for three amenities for six brands and find that returns vary across amenities, and returns on a single amenity can vary substantially across brands. The authors validate the results for one amenity against the ROI from the actual historical implementation of that amenity using a natural experiment with a before/after design with controls. The present research demonstrates that the return on service amenities model provides a useful decision tool for managers deciding which amenities are most profitable.","Rebecca W.

Shining Light on Atmospherics: How Ambient Light Influences Food Choices,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0115,01-Feb-17,01-Feb-17,54,1,111,123,"Retail atmospherics is emerging as a major competitive tool, and it is especially notable in the restaurant industry, where lighting is used to create the overall ambience and influence consumer experience. In addition to influencing overall experience, can ambient light luminance have unintended consequences in terms of influencing what diners order? The results of a field study at multiple locations of a major restaurant chain and a series of lab studies robustly show that consumers tend to choose less healthy food options when ambient lighting is dim (vs. bright). Process evidence suggests that this phenomenon occurs because ambient light luminance influences mental alertness, which in turn influences food choices. While restaurant and grocery store managers can use these insights and their ambient light switches to nudge consumers toward targeted food choices, such as healthy or high-margin signature items, health-conscious consumers can opt for dining environments with bright ambient lighting.","Dipayan Biswas, Courtney Szocs, Roger Chacko,...","ambient light, retail atmospherics, luminance, healthy/unhealthy food choices, sensory marketing",554

The study includes a longitudinal survey design, with perceived relationship performance reported by a second informant. The study, conducted within the context of Japanese suppliers reporting on their relationship with U.S. buyers, takes a nuanced view of both inequity and relative dependence by employing spline variables to disentangle potentially different effects of positive and negative inequity and relative dependence of the supplier and buyer, respectively. The results reveal that firms' reactions to positive and negative inequity vary depending on the nature of the interdependence structure and that positive and negative inequity differentially influence perceived relationship performance.

For example, of the 50 articles published in Journal of Marketing Research in 2013, only three (6%) were based on field experiments. The goal of this article is to motivate a methodological shift in marketing research and increase the proportion of empirical findings obtained using field experiments.

Does “Liking” Lead to Loving?

Or is “liking” simply a symptom of being fond of a brand? The authors disentangle these possibilities and find evidence for the latter: brand attitudes and purchasing are predicted by consumers' preexisting fondness for brands, and these are the same regardless of when and whether consumers “like” brands on social media. In addition, we explore possible second-order effects by examining whether “liking” brands might cause consumers' friends to view that brand more favorably. When consumers see that a friend has “liked” a brand, they are less likely to buy the brand relative to when they learn that a friend genuinely likes the brand in the offline sense, which is a more meaningful social endorsement. Taken together, five experiments and two meta-analyses (N > 14,000) suggest that turning “liking” into improved brand attitudes and increased purchasing by consumers and their friends may require more than just the click of a button.","Leslie K.

“Mere Measurement Plus”: How Solicitation of Open-Ended Positive Feedback Influences Customer Purchase Behavior,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0232,01-Feb-17,01-Feb-17,54,1,156,170,"In two studies (a longitudinal field experiment with an established business-to-consumer national chain, and a field experiment with a business-to-business software manufacturer), the authors demonstrate that starting a survey with an open-ended positive solicitation increases customer purchase behavior. Study 1, a longitudinal field experiment, shows that one year after the completion of a survey that began by asking customers what went well during their purchase experience, those customers spent 8.25% more than customers who had completed a survey that did not include the positive solicitation. Study 2 utlizes multiple treatment groups to assess the stepwise gains of solicitation, measurement, and solicitation frame. The results demonstrate (1) a mere solicitation effect, (2) a traditional mere measurement effect, and (3) an additional “mere measurement plus” effect of an open-ended positive solicitation; all effects increased customer spending. Specifically, starting a survey with an open-ended positive solicitation resulted in a 32.88% increase in customer spending relative to a survey with no open-ended positive solicitation. The findings suggest that firms can proactively influence the feedback process. Soliciting open-ended positive feedback can create positively biased memories of an experience; the subsequent expression of those memories in an open-ended feedback format further reinforces them, making them more salient and accessible in guiding future purchase behavior.","Sterling A.

Evaluating a natural experiment in which different results were shown to users who performed similar searches, they find that Google's prominent placement of its Flight Search service increased the clicks on paid advertising listings by more than half while decreasing the clicks on organic search listings by about the same quantity. This effect appears to result from interactions between the design of search results and users’ decisions about where and how to focus their attention: users who decide what to click on the basis of relevance were more likely to select paid listings, whereas users who are influenced by visual presentation and page position were more likely to click on Google's own Flight Search listing.

Measuring the Lifetime Value of a Customer in the Consumer Packaged Goods Industry,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0641,01-Dec-16,01-Dec-16,53,6,901,921,"In this study, the authors propose a flexible framework to assess customer lifetime value (CLV) in the consumer packaged goods (CPG) context. They address the substantive and modeling challenges that arise in this setting, namely, (1) multiple discreteness, (2) brand switching, and (3) budget-constrained consumption. Using a Bayesian estimation, the authors are also able to infer the consumer's latent budgetary constraint using only transaction information, thus enabling managers to understand the customer's budgetary constraint without having to survey or depend on aggregate measures of budget constraints. Using the proposed framework, CPG manufacturers can assess CLV at the focal brand level as well as at the category level, a departure from CLV literature, which has mostly been firm centric. The authors implement the proposed model on panel data in the carbonated beverages category and showcase the benefits of the proposed model over simpler heuristics and conventional CLV approaches. Finally, they conduct two policy simulations describing the role of the budget constraint on CLV, as well as the asymmetric effects of pricing in this setting, and develop managerial insights in this context.","Sarang Sunder, V.

The Calendar Mindset: Scheduling Takes the Fun Out and Puts the Work In,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0591,01-Dec-16,01-Dec-16,53,6,922,936,"Consumers often schedule their activities in an attempt to use their time more efficiently. Although the benefits of scheduling are well established, its potential downsides are not well understood. The authors examine whether scheduling uniquely undermines the benefits of leisure activities. In 13 studies using unambiguous leisure activities that consumers commonly schedule (e.g., movies, a coffee break), they find that scheduling a leisure activity (vs. experiencing it impromptu) makes it feel less free-flowing and more work-like. Furthermore, scheduling diminishes utility from leisure activities, in terms of both excitement in anticipation of the activities and experienced enjoyment. Importantly, the authors find that maintaining the free-flowing nature of the activity by “roughly scheduling” (without prespecified times) eliminates this effect, thus indicating that the effect is driven by a detriment from scheduling rather than by a boost from spontaneity. The reported findings highlight an important opportunity for marketers to improve consumers’ experiences and utility by leveraging scheduling behavior while also providing important implications for consumer well-being from leisure consumption.","Gabriela N.

When Remembering Disrupts Knowing: Blocking Implicit Price Memory,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0335,01-Dec-16,01-Dec-16,53,6,937,953,"Does explicit recall help or hurt memory-based comparisons? It is often assumed that attempting to recall information from memory should facilitate—or at least not disrupt—memory-based comparisons. Using the domain of price comparisons, the authors demonstrate that memory-based price comparisons are less accurate when consumers first attempt to recall the past price versus when they do not try to do so. Attempting—and failing at—explicit price recall focuses attention on metacognitive experience, resulting in a feeling-of-not-knowing, which then blocks the implicit memory that people could otherwise use to make accurate price comparisons. Drawing attention to this metacognitive feeling-of-not-knowing increases the blocking effect of recall on implicit memory, whereas drawing attention away from the feeling reduces the blocking effect. The results identify a new type of memory blocking—metacognitive memory blocking—in which the feeling-of-not-knowing blocks implicit memory during judgments. They also provide further evidence of dual representations of price memory and demonstrate that most memory-based price comparisons are based on implicit memory and do not entail explicit recall of the reference price.","Ellie J.

Anticipation of Future Variety Reduces Satiation from Current Experiences,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0360,01-Dec-16,01-Dec-16,53,6,954,968,"Satiation frequently occurs from repeated consumption of the same items over time. However, results from five experiments show that when people anticipate consuming something different in the future, they satiate at a slower rate in the present. The authors find the effect in both food and nonfood consumption settings using different approaches to measure satiation. This effect is cognitive; specifically, anticipating variety in future consumption generates positive thoughts about that future experience. The authors find two boundary conditions: the future consumption outcome must be (1) in a related product category and (2) at least as attractive as the present consumption outcome. The authors rule out potential alternative explanations such as mere exposure to variety, the possibility that the future experience is more attractive (rather than just different) than the current one, and perceptions of scarcity associated with the item consumed in the present.","Julio Sevilla, Jiao Zhang, Barbara E.

Fairness Ideals in Distribution Channels,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0093,01-Dec-16,01-Dec-16,53,6,969,987,"The authors analytically and experimentally evaluate how firms make decisions in a two-stage dyadic channel, in which firms decide on investments in the first stage and then on prices in the second stage. They find that firms’ behavior differs significantly from the predictions of the standard economic model and is consistent with the existence of fairness concerns. Using a quantal response equilibrium model, in which both manufacturer and retailer make noisy best responses, the authors show that fairness significantly affects channel pricing decisions. In addition, they investigate what affects the perceptions of fairness. More specifically, they analyze whether the notion of fairness is influenced by social norms of strict equality, by endogenous investments and contributions that are affected by players’ decisions, or by the exogenous game structure. To do so, the authors compare four principles of distributive fairness: strict egalitarianism; liberal egalitarianism; libertarianism; and a sequence-aligned ideal, which is studied for the first time in the literature. Surprisingly, the exogenous game structure reflected by the new ideal, whereby the sequence of moving determines the equitable payoff for players, significantly outperforms other fairness ideals, suggesting that equity in distribution channels can arise even in contests in which channel members have fairly different payoffs.","Tony Haitao Cui, Paola Mallucci","fairness ideals, distribution channels, quantal response equilibrium, experimental economics",0

Empirical evidence and behavioral research have suggested that consumers may perceive a firm's price as unfair when its profit margin is too high relative to consumers’ surplus. The authors develop an analytical framework to investigate the effects of the consumer's inequity aversion on a firm's optimal pricing and quality decisions. They highlight several findings. First, because of the consumer's uncertainty about the firm's cost, the firm's optimal quality may be nonmonotone with respect to the degree of the consumer's inequity aversion. Second, stronger inequity aversion makes an inefficient firm worse off but may benefit an efficient firm. Third, stronger inequity aversion by the consumer can actually lower the consumer's monetary payoff (economic surplus) because the firm may reduce its quality to a greater extent than it reduces its price. Finally, as the expected cost efficiency in the market decreases, both the expected quality and the social surplus may increase rather than decrease.","Xiaomeng Guo, Baojun Jiang","behavioral economics, fairness, inequity aversion, asymmetric information, signaling, quality, pricing, search goods",0

Five studies in a gift registry context show that when close (vs. distant) givers receive attribution for the gifts they choose, they are more likely to diverge from the registry to choose items that signal their close relationships. The authors find that close givers’ divergence from the registry is not the result of their altruistic search for a “better” gift but is a strategic effort to express relational signals: it occurs only when givers will receive attribution for their choice. They show that close givers reconcile their goal conflict by engaging in motivated reasoning, which results in their perceptual distortion of the gift options in favor of relational-signaling gifts. Ironically, distant givers are more likely to choose gifts from the registry, resulting in the selection of items that better match recipient preferences.","Morgan K. Ward, Susan M.

When planning a weekend for oneself and one's spouse, for example, a person could choose more varied activities (e.g., going out to dinner, to a movie, and to a concert) or less varied activities (e.g., seeing several different movies). What might affect how much variety people choose? Five experiments demonstrate that how much variety consumers prefer for joint consumption in committed relationships depends on their relationship time perspective (i.e., the perceived time ahead in the relationship). When consumers perceive more (vs. less) time ahead in a committed relationship, they prefer more variety for joint consumption with their partners. This increased preference for variety is driven by a shift in how much excitement is valued within the relationship and is unique to choices for joint consumption with the specific relationship partner. The findings demonstrate that variety preferences depend not just on personal or situational factors but also on aspects of consumers’ social relationships.",Jordan Etkin,"variety seeking, decision making, social relationships, future time perspective, aging and longevity",14

Eating a food activates a goal to consume foods that consumers perceive to be well paired with the consumed food. In five experiments, imagined and actual consumption of a food sensitized participants to complementary foods but not to unrelated or semantically associated foods.

Horizontal (vs. vertical) displays are easier to process due to a match between the human binocular vision field (which is horizontal in direction) and the dominant direction of eye movements required for processing horizontal displays. It is demonstrated that this processing fluency allows people to browse information more efficiently, which increases perceived assortment variety and ultimately leads to more variety being chosen, and if the number of options chosen is allowed to vary, it leads to more options chosen. It is shown that because people see more variety in a horizontal (vs. vertical) display, they process a horizontal assortment more extensively. When more variety is positive, they find the choice task easier and have a higher level of satisfaction and confidence about their choices. When more variety is not necessarily positive, for example, in a choice of a single most-preferred option, these effects disappear.

This occurs because the cue increases consumers’ confidence in being able to retain and access the information seen in-store, which engenders positive feelings about the decision to purchase.

The authors hypothesize that this effect is due to low versus high levels of IC triggering distinct psychological motives. Low IC activates the motive to self-enhance, and communicating positive information is typically more instrumental to this motive than communicating negative information. In contrast, high IC activates the motive to protect others, and communicating negative information is typically more instrumental to this motive than communicating positive information. Four experiments provide evidence for the basic effect and the underlying role of consumers’ motives to self-enhance and protect others through mediation and moderation.

The advertiser selects the agency that offers the best combination of creative quality and media cost, similar to conducting a score auction. To participate in the contest, each agency needs to incur an up-front bid-preparation cost to cover the development of a customized creative campaign. Agency industry literature has called for the advertiser to fully reimburse such costs to all agencies that enter the contest. The authors analyze the optimal stipend policy of an advertiser facing agencies with asymmetric bid-preparation costs, such that the incumbent agency faces a lower bid-preparation cost than a competitor agency entering the contest. The authors show that reimbursing bid-preparation costs in full is never optimal, nor is reimbursing any part of the incumbent's bid-preparation cost.

Knowing When to Spend: Unintended Financial Consequences of Earmarking to Encourage Savings,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0455,01-Oct-16,01-Oct-16,53,5,790,803,"Maintaining savings is an important financial goal. Yet there are times when savings should be spent, such as when people face unavoidable costs, and spending their savings allows them to avoid high interest rate debt. Existing behavioral research has focused on consumer decisions between savings and discretionary spending and has proposed interventions to promote savings in these contexts. However, when spending is not discretionary, such interventions could risk exacerbating a pattern found in economic research in which people borrow high interest rate debt while maintaining savings that earn low levels of interest. To examine how mental accounting interacts with considerations of personal responsibility and guilt to contribute to this pattern, this article explores whether people spend their savings when they need money most: during emergencies. Six studies reveal that people's tendency to preserve savings by borrowing from a high interest rate credit option varies as a function of the savings’ intended use. Paradoxically, people are most likely to turn to high interest rate credit with the belief that doing so is the responsible option.","Abigail B. Sussman, Rourke L.

The Illusion of Wealth and Its Reversal,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0652,01-Oct-16,01-Oct-16,53,5,804,813,"Research on choice architecture is shaping policy around the world, touching on areas ranging from retirement economics to environmental issues. Recently, researchers and policy makers have begun paying more attention not just to choice architecture but also to information architecture, or the format in which information is presented to people. In this article, the authors investigate information architecture as it applies to consumption in retirement. Specifically, in three experiments, they examine how people react to lump sums versus equivalent streams of monthly income. Their primary question of interest is whether people exhibit more or less sensitivity to changes in retirement wealth expressed as lump sums (e.g., $100,000) or monthly equivalents (e.g., $500 per month for life). They also test whether people exhibit an “illusion of wealth,” by which lump sums seem more adequate than monthly amounts in certain conditions, as well as the opposite effect, in which lump sums seem less adequate. They conclude by discussing how format-dependent perceptions of wealth can affect policy and consumers’ financial decision making.","Daniel G. Goldstein, Hal E.

A series of studies shows that this strategic allocation of resources occurs in two ways. Consumers experiencing stress may show increased saving behavior, which assures them that monetary resources will be available when needed. Alternatively, consumers experiencing stress may show increased spending behavior, directed specifically toward products that the consumer perceives to be necessities and that allow for control in an otherwise uncontrollable environment. This conceptualization and the related findings can inform assessments of when stress will lead to beneficial or impulsive consumer behaviors.","Kristina M.

In eight studies, comprising 11,508 participants making 2,423 donation decisions in both experimental settings and a large-scale natural field experiment, the authors investigate the effect of “choice-option” defaults on the donation rate, average donation amount, and the resulting revenue. They find (1) a “scale-back” effect, in which low defaults reduce average donation amounts; (2) a “lower-bar” effect, in which defaulting a low amount increases donation rate; and (3) a “default-distraction” effect, in which introducing any defaults reduces the effect of other cues, such as positive charity information. Contrary to the view that setting defaults will backfire, defaults increased revenue in the field study. However, the findings suggest that defaults can sometimes be a “self-canceling” intervention, with countervailing effects of default option magnitude on decisions and resulting in no net effect on revenue.

In five experiments, the authors ask U.S. and French adults and children to imagine vividly the taste, smell, and texture of three hedonic foods before choosing a portion size of another hedonic food. Compared with a control condition, this “multisensory imagery” intervention led hungry and nondieting people to choose smaller food portions, and they anticipated greater eating enjoyment and were willing to pay more for them. This occurred because multisensory imagery prompted participants to evaluate portions on the basis of expected sensory pleasure, which peaks with smaller portions, rather than hunger. In contrast, health-based interventions led people to choose a smaller portion than the one they expected to enjoy most—a hedonic cost for them and an economic cost for food marketers.","Yann Cornil, Pierre Chandon","food consumption, health, portion size, nutrition, mental imagery",179

Consumer advocates have proposed that disclosing how defaults are intended to influence choices could help protect consumers from being unknowingly manipulated. This research shows that consumers appreciate transparency, but disclosure does not make defaults less influential. Seven experiments demonstrate that disclosure alters how fair consumers perceive defaults to be but does not attenuate default effects because consumers do not understand how to counter the processes by which defaults bias their judgment. Given that defaults lead consumers to focus disproportionately on reasons to choose the default even with disclosure, debiasing default effects requires that consumers engage in a more balanced consideration of the default and its alternative. Encouraging people to articulate their preferences for the default or its alternative, as in a forced choice, shifts the focus away from the default and reduces default effects.","Mary Steffel, Elanor F.

He finds that ads increase the chances of sales for nonadvertised restaurants significantly. The spillover benefits are concentrated on restaurants that serve the advertiser's cuisine and have a high rating on the restaurant-search website. The extent of spillovers also depends on the intensity of the advertising effort. The spillovers are largest when the intensity (frequency) of advertising is low. As the intensity increases, the spillovers disappear and the advertiser gains more sales. These patterns are consistent with the following mechanism: ads increase the chance of consumers buying the advertised product but also remind consumers of similar (nonadvertised) options. Higher ad intensity leads to a stronger direct effect favoring the advertiser and can offset the spillover caused by the broader reminder.",Navdeep S.

Finally, the authors find that exposure to sex-based ads does not lead to a decreased preference for romantically linked products in women.

Analyses based on 488 elasticities drawn from 83 studies reveal a mean elasticity of .04 for advertising expenditure variables and of .54 for marketing asset variables. Among marketing assets, customer-related assets show a higher mean elasticity of .72, compared with .33 for brand-related assets. Further analyses show that advertising elasticities are lower in more concentrated industries and that marketing asset elasticities are higher during recession times.

The authors further find that expectations regarding changes in income (and not changes in expenses) predict responses to the Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment, a leading macroeconomic indicator. Finally, the authors conduct a meta-analysis of their entire file drawer (27 studies, 8,418 participants) and find that (1) across studies, participants place 2.9 times greater weight on income change than they do on expense change when forecasting changes in their financial slack, and (2) expense neglect is stronger for distant than for near-future forecasts.","Jonathan Z.

Three controlled experiments, two in the behavioral lab and one in the field, with exposure durations ranging from very brief (100 msec) to very long (30 sec), demonstrate that advertising evaluation critically depends on the duration of ad exposure and on how ads convey which product and brand they promote, but in surprising ways. The experiments show that upfront ads, which instantly convey what they promote, are evaluated positively after brief but also after longer exposure durations. Mystery ads, which suspend conveying what they promote, are evaluated negatively after brief but positively after longer exposure durations. False front ads, which initially convey another identity than what they promote, are evaluated positively after brief exposures but negatively after longer exposure durations.

Reasoning that decisions taken in response to analyst forecasts involve discretionary budgets, the authors study four contingent conditions under which quarterly analyst forecasts drive unanticipated adjustments to advertising and R&D budgets, and the long-term consequences of these budgetary changes. The choice of contingent conditions is related to agency theory–driven concepts of monitoring and bonding costs. Results from a panel data set of 515 firms and a hierarchical Bayesian model that provides firm-level coefficients show that both artificially imposed incentives on managers (monitoring costs) and personal career management concerns (bonding costs) moderate the extent to which managers react to analyst forecasts. Specifically, (1) bonus versus equity proportion of CEO compensation enhances the likelihood of managers reacting to analyst forecasts with unanticipated decreases in advertising and R&D budgets; (2) output experience of CEOs decreases this likelihood; (3) throughput experience of CEOs increases this likelihood; and (4) increasing marketing and R&D intensity decreases this likelihood.

Five studies show that people sensibly expect others to like similar products, but erroneously expect others to dislike dissimilar ones. While people readily select dissimilar items for themselves (particularly if the dissimilar item is of higher quality than a similar one), they fail to predict this choice for others—even when monetary rewards are at stake. The tendency to infer dislike from dissimilarity is driven by a belief that others have narrow and homogeneous ranges of preferences.","Kate Barasz, Tami Kim, Leslie K.

An empirically validated agent-based model simulates the U.S. motion picture market, with new movies launching, competing, and exiting. The agent-based model serves as a means to demonstrate the essential role of shared consumption for explaining movie life cycles and tests how advertising expenditures accelerate and/or acquire movies’ demand in markets with varying levels of shared consumption. The results provide key theoretical insights for the new product diffusion of hedonic products and help managers predict the financial consequences of their strategic decisions.","Sebastiano A.

A second study, focusing only on plural structure alliances, shows that horizontal relationship factors (i.e., market overlap and prior relationship between downstream partners) interact with the upstream firm's greater alliance experience and reputation to lead to better returns for the upstream firm.","Eric (ER) Fang, Jongkuk Lee, Robert Palmatier,...","marketing alliance, plural structure, dyadic structure, interfirm relationships, dependence balancing",0

In addition, whereas eWOM has a stronger effect on sales for tangible goods new to the market, the product life cycle does not moderate the eWOM effectiveness for services.

An analysis of alliance networks in the consumer packaged goods industry from 1990 to 2010 shows that a central position in a global network represents a double-edged sword: it improves a firm's incremental new product launches but harms its breakthrough new product launches. Furthermore, a firm's ego network (manifested as density and diversity) and R&D capability enable it to leverage its global network position by enhancing the benefits for incremental new products and mitigating its hazards for breakthrough new products.

Is Top 10 Better than Top 9?

For example, marketers may prefer to highlight a brand's membership in the top 10 tier of a third-party list instead of disclosing the brand's exact rank. The authors propose that when marketers use these types of imprecise advertising claims, subtle differences in the selection of a tier boundary (e.g., top 9 vs. top 10) can influence consumers’ evaluations and willingness to pay. Specifically, the authors find a comfort tier effect in which a weaker claim that references a less exclusive but commonly used tier boundary can actually lead to higher brand evaluations than a stronger claim that references a more exclusive but less common tier boundary. This effect is attributed to a two-stage process by which consumers evaluate imprecise rank claims. The results demonstrate that consumers have specific expectations for how messages are constructed in marketing communications and may make negative inferences about a brand when these expectations are violated, thus attenuating the positive effect such claims might otherwise have on consumer responses.","Mathew S.

The first study, a secondary data analysis, finds that longer delays between placing an order and picking up the meal are associated with reductions in calorie content. The second study tests the causality of this relationship by exogenously restricting some lunch orders to be substantially delayed, leading to a marginally significant (approximately 5%) reduction in calories among delayed orders. The third study compares orders for truly immediate consumption versus orders placed in advance and demonstrates a significant (100 calorie, or approximately 10%) reduction in lunch calories.

They demonstrate that when negotiators expect a role reversal, they are likely to make more concessions and reach agreement more quickly in the current negotiation. The authors find that this effect is driven by negotiators’ beliefs that they will be able to recover these concessions, because negotiators expect their counterparts to reciprocate in the later transaction when the parties reverse roles. However, when the two negotiations occur in different “accounting” periods (i.e., fiscal periods) or when the negotiating parties do not explicitly communicate their willingness to reverse roles in the future, role-reversal expectations do not affect concession making.

In this article, three studies examine how productivity metrics influence consumer decision making. Many consumers have incorrect intuitions about the impact of productivity increases on time savings: they do not sufficiently realize that productivity increases at the high end of the productivity range (e.g., from 40 to 50 Mbps) imply smaller time savings than productivity increases at the low end of the productivity range (e.g., from 10 to 20 Mbps). Consequently, the availability of productivity metrics increases willingness to pay for products and services that offer higher productivity levels. This tendency is smaller when consumers receive additional information about time savings through product experience or through metrics that are linearly related to time savings. Consumers’ intuitions about time savings are also more accurate when they estimate time savings than when they rank them. Estimates are based less on absolute than on proportional changes in productivity (and proportional changes correspond more with actual time savings).","Bart De Langhe, Stefano Puntoni","time perception, numeracy, productivity, efficiency, heuristics and biases",25
Price Transparency and Retail Prices: Evidence from Fuel Price Signs in the Italian Highway System,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0411,01-Jun-16,01-Jun-16,53,3,407,423,"Price transparency initiatives are typically undertaken by third parties to ensure that consumers can compare the prices of competing offers in markets in which obtaining such information is costly. Such practices have recently become widespread, yet it is unclear whether the increased price competition due to lower search costs overcomes the potential for collusion between competitors due to lower price coordination costs. Motivated by this question, the authors investigate the effect of mandatory price posting (on large electronic signs) on the pricing behavior of competing gas stations in the Italian highway system. The authors find that when prices are posted, the average price of gasoline decreases by 1 euro cent per liter, which represents about 20% of stations’ margins. About half the price decrease can be attributed to the introduction of a sign posting a station's own price and those of its nearest neighbors, with the other half due to the introduction of other signs posting the prices of other stations on the same road. Despite the price reduction, however, the introduction of signs seems to have little impact on price dispersion, suggesting that price uncertainty persists even after the policy is implemented.

“Yes/No/Not Right Now”: Yes/No Response Formats Can Increase Response Rates Even in Non-Forced-Choice Settings,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0227,01-Jun-16,01-Jun-16,53,3,424,432,"Although yes/no response formats have been used to increase enrollment rates in several different types of programs, their effectiveness has generally been tested in forced-choice settings. The effects on postchoice engagement have not been measured. Across two field experiments in an e-mail context in which choice is not forced, the authors demonstrate a substantial advantage in click-through rates for a yes/no response format over traditional opt-in response formats. The increase in click-through rate does, under certain conditions, also persist through downstream program enrollment and participation. Finally, though noting that the yes/no format advantage is probably multidetermined, the authors discuss several potential psychological mechanisms, which are particularly relevant in non-forced-choice settings. The authors also discuss how the yes/no response format might operate in other settings, such as the implementation of mandated choice for organ donation.","Eleanor Putnam-Farr, Jason Riis","choice architecture, decision making, field experiment, response format",0
"Does Sparing the Rod Spoil the Child? How Praising, Scolding, and an Assertive Tone Can Encourage Desired Behaviors",https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0224,01-Jun-16,01-Jun-16,53,3,433,441,"In search of effective ways to encourage consumers to follow desired behaviors such as healthy eating, recycling, or financial planning, marketers sometimes use praise (e.g., “You are doing great”) and sometimes use scolding (e.g., “You are not doing enough”). However, the effectiveness of each approach in triggering behavior is not clear. A possible reason for the mixed results in this area is that it is not only what one says that matters but also how one says it: praising and scolding can be performed with a more or less assertive tone. This research introduces assertiveness as a moderator that can explain when praising or scolding would be more effective. Two field experiments in the context of hand hygiene and financial planning demonstrate that when communicators praise consumers, an assertive tone may be more effective in encouraging behavior, whereas scolding requires a nonassertive tone. The authors then replicate these field findings in a controlled laboratory experiment, which also provides click rates as an actual behavioral outcome.","Amir Grinstein, Ann Kronrod","field experiment, prosocial, praise, scold, assertive",13
Exploring the Differences between Conscious and Unconscious Goal Pursuit,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0263,01-Jun-16,01-Jun-16,53,3,442,458,"People can be aware (conscious) or unaware (unconscious) of an active goal when making a choice. Being aware of a goal enables people to use conscious strategies to identify attributes that are relevant to goal pursuit and to assess the efficacy of the attributes of each choice alternative. For most people, this process encourages the choice of the most goal-consistent alternative. For some people, this process encourages the consideration of trade-offs, activates a competing goal, and encourages the choice of a goal-inconsistent alternative. With unconscious goal pursuit, people cannot devote resources to assessing the efficacy of the attributes of each alternative; therefore, they match the accessible goal to the attributes of the available alternatives. As a result, the unconscious selects an alternative with attributes that are consistent with the goal and not necessarily the alternative that is most efficacious for the goal. The authors investigate these processes by manipulating the conscious system's ability to assess the efficacy of product attributes and the unconscious system's ability to match the accessible goal to product attributes.","Juliano Laran, Chris Janiszewski, Anthony Salerno","unconscious goal pursuit, conscious goal pursuit, accessibility, elaboration, choice",7
Halo (Spillover) Effects in Social Media: Do Product Recalls of One Brand Hurt or Help Rival Brands?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0009,01-Apr-16,01-Apr-16,53,2,143,160,"Online chatter is important because it is spontaneous, passionate, information rich, granular, and live. Thus, it can forewarn and be diagnostic about potential problems with automobile models, known as nameplates. The authors define “perverse halo” (or negative spillover) as the phenomenon whereby negative chatter about one nameplate increases negative chatter for another nameplate. The authors test the existence of such a perverse halo for 48 nameplates from four different brands during a series of automobile recalls. The analysis is by individual and panel vector autoregressive models. The study finds that perverse halo is extensive. It occurs for nameplates within the same brand across segments and across brands within segments. It is strongest between brands of the same country. Perverse halo is asymmetric, being stronger from a dominant brand to a less dominant brand than vice versa. Apology advertising about recalls has harmful effects on both the recalled brand and its rivals. Furthermore, these halo effects affect downstream performance metrics such as sales and stock market performance. Online chatter amplifies the negative effect of recalls on downstream sales by about 4.5 times.","Abhishek Borah, Gerard J.

Homogeneous Contracts for Heterogeneous Agents: Aligning Sales Force Composition and Compensation,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0018,01-Apr-16,01-Apr-16,53,2,161,182,"Observed contracts in the real world are often very simple, which partly reflects the constraints faced by contracting firms in making the contracts more complex. In this article, the authors focus on one such rigidity: the constraints faced by firms in fine-tuning contracts to the full distribution of heterogeneity of their employees. The authors explore the implication of these constraints for the provision of incentives within the firm. The study's application is to sales force compensation, wherein a firm maintains a sales force to market its products. Consistent with ubiquitous real-world business practice, the study assumes that a firm is restricted to fully or partially set uniform commissions across its agent pool. The authors show that this restriction implies an interaction between the composition of agent types in the contract and the compensation policy used to motivate them, leading to a “contractual externality” in the firm and generating gains to sorting. This article explains how this contractual externality arises; discusses a practical approach to endogenizing agents and incentives at a firm in its presence; and presents an empirical application to sales force compensation contracts at a U.S. Fortune 500 company that explores these considerations and assesses the gains from a sales force architecture that sorts agents into divisions to balance firmwide incentives. Empirically, the authors find that the restriction to homogeneous plans significantly reduces a firm's payoff, relative to a fully heterogeneous plan, when the firm is unable to optimize the composition of its agents. However, a firm's payoff under a homogeneous plan comes very close to that under a fully heterogeneous plan when the firm can optimize both composition and compensation. Thus, in the empirical setting of this study, the ability to choose agents mitigates the loss in incentives from the restriction to uniform contracts. The authors conjecture this result may hold more broadly.","Øystein Daljord, Sanjog Misra, Harikesh S. Nair","sales force compensation, incentives, hiring, agency theory, dynamics",0
The Influence of Serotonin Deficiency on Choice Deferral and the Compromise Effect,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0482,01-Apr-16,01-Apr-16,53,2,183,198,"Psychological and physiological states such as mood, hunger, stress, and sleep deprivation are known to affect decision-making processes and therefore crucially influence consumer behavior. A possible biological mechanism underlying the observed variability of consumer behavior is the context-sensitive variation in the levels of neuromodulators in the brain. In a series of four experimental studies, the authors pharmaceutically reduce the levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain to diminish the availability of subjects’ cognitive resources. In doing so, they study how serotonin brain levels influence (1) subjects’ tendency to avoid buying and (2) consumers' preference for product options positioned as a compromise in a given choice set rather than for more extreme alternatives (i.e., the compromise effect). Using realistic product choice scenarios in a binding decision framework, they find that a reduction of brain serotonin levels leads to choice deferral and decreases the compromise effect, both as a within-subjects and as a between-subjects choice phenomenon. As such, this study provides neurobiological evidence for the assumption that the compromise effect is the result of deliberate and demanding thought processes rather than intuitive decision making.","Marcel Lichters, Claudia Brunnlieb, Gideon Nave,...","choice deferral, compromise effect, real payments, serotonin, tryptophan depletion",8
Can Sales Uncertainty Increase Firm Profits?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0506,01-Apr-16,01-Apr-16,53,2,199,206,"The authors add to the sales management literature in three ways. First, they demonstrate that a firm can benefit from higher sales uncertainty. This is contrary to the finding from the standard principal–agent models that more sales uncertainty hurts the firm when agents are risk-averse. Second, the authors find that the risk-averse agent's total pay can increase when there is high sales uncertainty, and this too is contrary to the standard principal–agent model. Third, they provide intuition for this surprising result by showing that it holds when the slope of the sales response function is random but not when the intercept is random. When the responsiveness (slope) of sales to a decision variable (of the firm or the agent) is random, information about randomness becomes decision-relevant and the firm can exploit learned information. In this study's model, the agent and firm can receive noisy signals of random demand. When the customers’ response to effort (or price) is random, the decision about effort (price) responds optimally to information in a way that benefits the firm. When uncertainty is high, there is more potential information for the firm to exploit profitably, owing to the convexity of the sales with respect to the uncertainty parameter. This is enough to dominate the negative impact of uncertainty owing to agents’ risk aversion. When randomness affects only baseline sales (intercept), received signals are not decision-relevant. In that case, higher uncertainty has only a negative impact, just as in standard principal–agent models.","Niladri Syam, James D.

Advertising Effectiveness: The Moderating Effect of Firm Strategy,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0285,01-Apr-16,01-Apr-16,53,2,207,224,"Advertising's influence on firm sales and firm value has drawn early attention from economists and accountants and more recent attention from marketers. Most studies that have investigated a link between advertising and sales have found such a link. However, studies that have investigated a link between advertising and firm value have only sometimes found that link. Meta-analysis has failed to determine moderators that govern the link between advertising and firm value. In this article, the authors hypothesize that advertising influences firm value for a differentiator because advertising can elaborate the firm's point of difference into brand equity, thereby building firm value. Advertising cannot build brand equity for a cost leader because such a firm has no point of difference on which to build. Identifying differentiators and cost leaders on the basis of firms’ reactions to a change in accounting regulations, the authors confirm hypotheses: advertising is related to sales for all firms, but it is more strongly related to firm value for differentiators than for cost leaders. Beyond explaining differences in advertising effectiveness, this study's indicator of differentiation versus cost leadership should enhance future analyses of marketing's effect on firm-level outcomes using archival financial data.","Leigh McAlister, Raji Srinivasan, Niket Jindal,...","advertising, differentiation, cost leadership, sales, firm value",1

The authors find insights linking WOM valence, WOM channel, and social tie strength that could not be revealed if the WOM conversations were analyzed in an aggregated form. The findings contribute to research that investigates differences between offline WOM and online WOM. The authors find that the relationship of WOM valence with purchase intentions is exacerbated when the conversation occurs offline, whereas offline conversations tend to be more strongly associated with WOM retransmission intentions regardless of the conversation's valence. The results also provide insights into how interpersonal characteristics influence WOM outcomes. Specifically, the authors find that the strength of the social tie relationship tends to influence a WOM receiver's intentions to purchase a brand; however, social tie strength has a much weaker association with a consumer's WOM retransmission intentions.","Andrew M.

Consumer Preferences for Annuity Attributes: Beyond Net Present Value,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0004,01-Apr-16,01-Apr-16,53,2,240,262,"Decisions about life annuities are an important part of consumer decumulation of retirement assets, yet they are relatively underexplored by marketing researchers studying consumer financial decision making. In this article, the authors propose and estimate a model of individual preferences for life annuity attributes using a choice-based stated-preference survey. Annuities are presented in terms of consumer-relevant attributes such as monthly income, yearly adjustments, period certain guarantees, and company financial strength. The authors find that these attributes directly influence consumer preferences beyond their impact on the annuity's expected present value. The strength of the direct influence depends on how annuities are described: when annuities are represented only through basic attributes, consumers undervalue inflation protection, and preferences are not monotonically increasing in duration of period certain guarantees. When descriptions of annuities are enriched with cumulative payment information, consumers no longer undervalue inflation protection, but nonlinear preferences for period certain options remain. The authors find that among annuities with the same expected payout but different annual increases and period certain guarantees, the proportion of consumers who choose the annuity over self-management can vary by more than a factor of 2.","Suzanne B.

Lower Connectivity is Better: The Effects of Network Structure on Redundancy of Ideas and Customer Innovativeness in Interdependent Ideation Tasks,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0127,01-Apr-16,01-Apr-16,53,2,263,279,"This article examines the popular marketing practice of interdependent ideation, whereby firms solicit ideas from customers through online platforms that enable customers to be exposed to or “inspired” by other customers’ ideas when generating their own. Although being exposed to others’ ideas means that customers are “connected” (at least implicitly) in a communication network that facilities the flow of ideas, the effect of network structure on individual innovativeness has not been considered in this context. The authors examine how, when, and why network structure—specifically, the clustering, or interconnectivity, of one's “inspirations” (other customers)—affects the innovativeness of individual customers’ product/service ideas in ideation tasks. Across five experiments, the authors show that (1) higher clustering/interconnectivity negatively affects the innovativeness of a customer's ideas; (2) this effect occurs because idea inspirations are more likely to be similar or redundant when their sources (i.e., other customers to which one is connected) are clustered; (3) greater redundancy among ideas used as inspirations is what causes lower innovativeness; and (4) this effect is attenuated when customers do not rely on other customers’ ideas for inspiration.","Andrew T.

Community Participation and Consumer-to-Consumer Helping: Does Participation in Third Party–Hosted Communities Reduce One's Likelihood of Helping?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0301,01-Apr-16,01-Apr-16,53,2,280,295,"Third party–hosted consumer communities in general, and brand communities in particular, have been touted for their ability to generate value for firms by promoting consumer-to-consumer (C2C) helping. However, little research has examined whether consumer communities actually foster C2C helping, and who is helped. In contrast, the brand-community literature suggests community strategies may reduce the likelihood of community members helping non–community members. If so, strategies that promote third party–hosted brand or product-category communities may be counterproductive in fostering C2C helping. Should firms focus on promoting brand communities, promoting product-category communities, or both? On the basis of a hazard model analysis of 9,192 actual C2C helping events over a 25-month period, and supported by a second cross-sectional study, this article examines how participation in brand and product-category communities influences one's likelihood of helping others. We find that brand-community participation increases one's likelihood of helping fellow members while reducing the likelihood of helping members of rival brand communities. Surprisingly, product-category community participation reduces one's likelihood of helping members of brand communities. The authors discuss managerial recommendations.","Scott A.

Eye Tracking Reveals Processes that Enable Conjoint Choices to Become Increasingly Efficient with Practice,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0467,01-Feb-16,01-Feb-16,53,1,1,17,"Choice-based conjoint is a popular technique for characterizing consumers’ choices. Three eye-tracking studies explore decision processes in conjoint choices that take less time and become more accurate with practice. These studies reveal two simplification processes that are associated with greater speed and reliability. Alternative focus gradually shifts attention toward options that represent promising choices, whereas attribute focus directs attention to important attributes that are most likely to alter or confirm a decision. Alternative and attribute focus increase in intensity with practice. In terms of biases, the authors detect a small but consistent focus on positive aspects of the item chosen and negative aspects of the items not chosen. They also show that incidental exposures arising from the first-examined alternative or from alternatives in a central horizontal location increase attention but have a much more modest and often insignificant impact on conjoint choices. Overall, conjoint choice is found to be a process that is (1) largely formed by goal-driven values that respondents bring to the task and (2) relatively free of distorting effects from task layout or random exposures.","Martin Meißner, Andres Musalem, Joel Huber","eye tracking, conjoint, choice models, incidental exposure, goal-driven processes",1

Is A 70% Forecast more Accurate than a 30% Forecast? How Level of a Forecast Affects Inferences about Forecasts and Forecasters,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0526,01-Feb-16,01-Feb-16,53,1,31,45,"Consumers routinely rely on forecasters to make predictions about uncertain events (e.g., sporting contests, stock fluctuations). The authors demonstrate that when forecasts are higher versus lower (e.g., a 70% vs. 30% chance of team A winning a game), consumers infer that the forecaster is more confident in his or her prediction, has conducted more in-depth analyses, and is more trustworthy. Consumers also judge the prediction as more accurate. This occurs because people tend to evaluate forecasts on the basis of how well they predict a target event occurring (e.g., team A winning). Higher forecasts indicate greater likelihood of the target event occurring and signal a confident analyst, while lower forecasts indicate lower likelihood and lower confidence in the target event occurring. Yet because with lower forecasts, consumers still focus on the target event (rather than its complement), lower confidence in the target event occurring is erroneously interpreted as the forecaster being less confident in his or her overall prediction (instead of more confident in the complementary event occurring, i.e., team A losing). The authors identify boundary conditions, generalize to other prediction formats, and demonstrate consequences of their findings.","Rajesh Bagchi, Elise Chandon Ince","event prediction, subjective probability, accuracy, outcomes, forecasting",14
The Perils of Proactive Churn Prevention Using Plan Recommendations: Evidence from a Field Experiment,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0483,01-Feb-16,01-Feb-16,53,1,46,60,"Facing the issue of increasing customer churn, many service firms have begun recommending pricing plans to their customers. One reason behind this type of retention campaign is that customers who subscribe to a plan suitable for them should be less likely to churn because they derive greater benefits from the service. In this article, the authors examine the effectiveness of such retention campaigns using a large-scale field experiment in which some customers are offered plan recommendations and some are not. They find that being proactive and encouraging customers to switch to cost-minimizing plans can, surprisingly, increase rather than decrease customer churn: whereas only 6% of customers in the control condition churned during the three months following the intervention, 10% did so in the treatment group. The authors propose two explanations for how the campaign increased churn, namely, (1) by lowering customers’ inertia to switch plans and (2) by increasing the salience of past-usage patterns among potential churners. The data provide support for both explanations. By leveraging the richness of their field experiment, the authors assess the impact of targeted encouragement campaigns on customer behavior and firm revenues and derive recommendations for service firms.","Eva Ascarza, Raghuram Iyengar, Martin Schleicher","churn/retention, field experiment, pricing, tariff/plan choice, targeting",35

In this study, the authors draw on signaling theory to develop and empirically test a cross-validation argument. They argue that how a firm treats one stakeholder group will be interpreted by investors in conjunction with how the firm treats another stakeholder group. Investors use consistency in stakeholder group treatment as a signal of complementarity in a firm's investments, which can improve the likelihood of competitive advantage. Specifically, the authors propose that a firm's achievements (lapses) directed at customers have a stronger positive (negative) impact on investors’ valuation of the firm if they are validated by the firm's achievements (lapses) directed at employees, and vice versa. Applying a multilevel model to a large sample of firms across various industries between 1994 and 2010, the authors find evidence to support these arguments. In addition, they find that cross-validation is more crucial for firms with a narrow than a broad business scope.","Christopher Groening, Vikas Mittal, Yan “Anthea” Zhang","signaling theory, achievements/lapses, business scope, stakeholder",32

Contrary to the intuition that varied experiences should enhance evaluation, five studies demonstrate that in some situations, perceiving usage experiences as less—not more—varied improves postpurchase product evaluation. Less varied usage experiences make consumers think that products are used more frequently. As a result, perceiving usage experiences as less varied makes consumers more satisfied with their purchase, more likely to buy it again, and more likely to recommend it. In addition to their practical implications, the findings make important theoretical contributions to the variety literature and toward understanding frequency and numerosity judgments.","Jordan Etkin, Aner Sela","variety, frequency judgments, product evaluation, experiences, similarity",15

When Do Consumers Avoid Imperfections?

Their findings show that these reactions function in a relatively automatic fashion, even emerging under conditions in which the packaging damage does not convey information about a health and safety threat from the product. The authors extend work on contagion to show that superficial packaging damage can act as a contamination cue, automatically activating thoughts of contamination and health and safety concerns. This tendency to avoid superficial packaging damage can be eliminated by counteracting these thoughts of contamination. This can be done with positive brand associations (i.e., by branding the product as organic) or by creating a physical buffer between the packaging damage and the product itself.

Marketers have developed fitness-branded food that may lead restrained eaters (i.e., consumers who are chronically concerned about their body weight) to believe that they can achieve these two goals at the same time by consuming the food. The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of fitness branding in food marketing (i.e., the integration of fitness into the branding of food) on consumption and physical activity in restrained (vs. unrestrained) eaters. The authors show that fitness branding increases consumption volumes for restrained eaters unless consumers view the food as dietary forbidden. Restrained eaters are also less physically active after consuming fitness-branded food, and food consumption volumes mediate this effect in restrained eaters. Fitness branding may therefore have undesirable effects on the weight-control behaviors of restrained eaters because it discourages physical activity despite an increase in consumption, which is contrary to the principle of energy balance.","Joerg Koenigstorfer, Hans Baumgartner","dietary restraint, food consumption, fitness, physical activity",118

Quantifying Under- and Overreporting in Surveys through a Dual-Questioning-Technique Design,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0336,01-Dec-15,01-Dec-15,52,6,737,753,"In recent years, marketing researchers have become increasingly interested in under- and overreporting. However, there are few suitable approaches to operationalize deviations from the truth, particularly in behavioral domains in which self-reports are usually the only viable method of choice to measure behavior or attitudes. An especially difficult situation arises if some people underreport while others overreport. This article proposes a Bayesian item response theory model to quantify under- and overreporting in surveys. The method utilizes within-person differences between answers obtained under direct questioning (no privacy protection) and randomized-response questioning (which ensures item-level privacy protection). This method has the important features of incorporating behavioral response-mode effects (e.g., privacy loss when switching from direct to randomized-response questioning, response-mode inertia effects) and allowing the direction of bias to differ across respondents. The authors provide an empirical application for excessive alcohol consumption involving 1,408 respondents from a commercial web panel.

In this article, the authors theoretically examine the rationale for the existence of multitier store brands, their optimal quality levels, and their implications for consumer welfare and channel profits. They show that despite the manufacturer's efforts to deter the entry of store brands by providing side payments and/or introducing additional national brands, the retailer will offer multitier store brands in equilibrium. Furthermore, the quality levels of store brands and national brands are interlaced, with a store brand taking the top-quality position unless national brands outnumber store brands. Even though the proliferation of store brands reduces product differentiation, it does not decrease consumer welfare or channel profits. However, store brands hurt the manufacturer's profits and make two-part tariffs ineffective in improving channel coordination. Nonetheless, the retailer can enhance channel coordination by procuring the store brand from the national brand manufacturer.

Consistent with the idea of small victories, when a task is broken down into parts of unequal size, participants perform faster when the parts are arranged in ascending order (i.e., from smallest to largest) rather than descending order (i.e., from largest to smallest). The calibrated model is consistent with the directional predictions of each theory. However, when participants are given choice over orderings, they choose the ascending ordering least often. The authors conclude with a discussion of the efficacy of this method in stylized debt-repayment scenarios.","Alexander L. Brown, Joanna N.

Suppliers Caught in Supermarket Price Wars: Victims or Victors? Insights from a Dutch Price War,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0180,01-Dec-15,01-Dec-15,52,6,784,800,"During retailer-initiated price wars (PWs), hundreds of brands are involved simultaneously, affecting brands’ and retailers’ positioning and ultimately making the performance outcome for individual brands difficult to predict. Likewise, the impact on brand performance after the PW, when prices are restored, is unclear. The authors use a natural-experiment approach to track brand sales and shares before, during, and after a long-lasting supermarket PW in the Dutch grocery market. They find that PWs are not truly revenue, sales, or share generators for most brands unless prices remain reduced permanently by the retailer. Only after the PW, when rivals’ prices are restored and the focal brand's reduced retail price is maintained, can substantial sales, revenues, and share gains be realized. Moreover, restoring prices without additional price promotion support can severely damage brands’ performance. Overall, national brands can gain share, sales, and revenue, but at the cost of not restoring regular prices, while private labels can benefit even when prices are restored after the PW ends.","Francesca Sotgiu, Katrijn Gielens","retailing, price wars, retailer–supplier relationships, consumer packaged goods",0
Competitive Vices,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0051,01-Dec-15,01-Dec-15,52,6,801,816,"In markets, firms must compete following a set of rules determined by laws, regulations, and social practices or pressures. This article investigates the effect of the degree of competition on the extent to which firms invest in behaving according to the rules of the marketplace. The authors model investments in following these rules as increasing the firm's marginal costs of production and decreasing its probability of being caught violating the market rules (and thus losing profits). They show that greater competition leads to smaller investments in following the market rules. This leads to (1) the existence of a social optimum degree of competition that is less than perfect competition and (2) more competition in general, thus prompting greater optimal monitoring efforts. Stricter market rules can lead to greater investments in satisfying the market rules and to lower production. The authors also present results on the likelihood of firms having broken the market rules depending on relative market shares, optimal monitoring, and the effect of dynamics on the incentives to satisfy the market rules.","Fernando Branco, J.

Healthy Choice: The Effect of Simplified Point-of-Sale Nutritional Information on Consumer Food Choice Behavior,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0270,01-Dec-15,01-Dec-15,52,6,817,835,"Grocery retailers are joining the fray against obesity by offering a wide range of health and wellness programs at the point of sale. However, the success of such programs in promoting healthy choices remains an open question. The authors examine the effectiveness of a growing health and wellness initiative: a simplified nutrition scoring system. They present a conceptual framework that predicts the effect of such a scoring system on shoppers’ food decisions and their sensitivity to price and promotion, as well as the moderating influence of category-level factors. Using a large-scale quasi experiment and panel data across eight product categories for more than 535,000 members of a grocery chain's frequent shopper program, the authors demonstrate that the point-of-sale nutrition scoring system helped consumers make healthier food choices, such that they switched to higher-scoring products in the postrollout period. The results also reveal that shoppers became less price sensitive and more promotion sensitive following the introduction of the food scoring system.

Transaction Attributes and Customer Valuation,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0377,01-Dec-15,01-Dec-15,52,6,848,864,"Dynamic customer targeting is a common task for marketers actively managing customer relationships. Such efforts can be guided by insight into the return on investment from marketing interventions, which can be derived as the increase in the present value of a customer's expected future transactions. Using the popular latent attrition framework, one could estimate this value by manipulating the levels of a set of nonstationary covariates. The authors propose such a model that incorporates transaction-specific attributes and maintains standard assumptions of unobserved heterogeneity. They demonstrate how firms can approximate an upper bound on the appropriate amount to invest in retaining a customer and demonstrate that this amount depends on customers’ past purchase activity—namely, the recency and frequency of past customer purchases. Using data from a business-to-business service provider as their empirical application, the authors apply the model to estimate the revenue the service provider loses when it fails to deliver a customer's requested level of service. They also show that the lost revenue is larger than the corresponding expected gain that would result from exceeding a customer's requested level of service.

What's in a Brand Name? Assessing the Impact of Rebranding in the Hospitality Industry,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0221,01-Dec-15,01-Dec-15,52,6,865,878,"In the context of the U.S. lodging industry (1994–2012), the authors empirically quantify the effects of the two main factors driving the rebranding effects identified by the theoretical branding literature—(1) the brand effect and (2) the interaction effect between the product (the hotel property) and the brands involved—on occupancy rate and other hotel performance indicators. They find that, on average, rebranding results in approximately a 6.31% increase in occupancy rates; 60% of this effect can be attributed to the brand identities (e.g., Holiday Inn) before and after rebranding while the remaining 40% is attributable to the interaction effect. The authors also find heterogeneity in the property–brand interaction effect of rebranding along various observable characteristics of the hotels. They assess the robustness of the results to various model assumptions and alternative instruments; in addition, they use matching estimators for analysis and exploit rebranding as a consequence of hotel mergers as a means of measuring rebranding effects. Finally, the authors consider the impact that rebranding might have on competitors’ properties. Their approach to measuring rebranding effects can be applied broadly to firms and industries experiencing a decoupling of the individual components of their value chain.","Yi-Lin Tsai, Chekitan s.

Banning Controversial Sponsors: Understanding Equilibrium Outcomes When Sports Sponsorships Are Viewed as Two-Sided Matches,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0225,01-Oct-15,01-Oct-15,52,5,593,615,"This article applies a two-sided matching model to investigate the consequences of banning controversial sponsors. Using a data set containing the shirt sponsorships from 43 English football clubs between 1990 and 2010, the authors' estimates suggest assortative matching between a club's attendance and a sponsor's revenue. In addition, sponsorships become less valuable as the distance between the club and the sponsor's head office grows, particularly for low-performing clubs and smaller domestic sponsors. The authors use these estimates to simulate the consequences of banning alcohol and gambling sponsors. Their estimates of counterfactual outcomes suggest that such bans may not have the largest impact on the clubs (particularly the relatively successful clubs) that currently have alcohol and gambling sponsors. Instead, clubs with low attendance and clubs in low-income areas will be most affected by a ban. More generally, the results demonstrate that when marketing relationships are viewed as the result of a matching process, actions that affect only some marketers may have substantial indirect effects on a variety of players in the market.","Yupin Yang, Avi Goldfarb","sponsorships, advertising regulation, matching markets, sports marketing, equilibrium outcomes",10

The authors develop a tailored community-matched measure of consumer reaction (consumer sentiment) and analyze more than 115,000 consumer posts from ten online forums with active firm participation. The results indicate that consumers show diminishing returns to active firm engagement, which, at very high levels, can undermine consumer sentiment. Further subgroup analyses by conversation type indicate that these relationships hold for conversations that address consumers' functional needs but do not hold for conversations that address social needs. Finally, the results show diminishing returns to firm engagement for consumers primarily interested in product-related support but show no relationship for consumers primarily interested in inspiration and entertainment.

To answer this question, the authors introduce a Double-Asymmetric Structural Vector Autoregressive model. It captures not only the short- and long-term effects of objective service performance on PSQ but also the differential effects of service crises versus service restoration. The authors analyze a unique data set from a major European railway company, spanning seven years of monthly observations. During this period, severe winter weather caused dramatic service crises. The authors find that performance losses loom larger than gains in the short run and also have permanent negative effects on PSQ in the long run. Consequently, a crisis followed by a restoration will result in a net negative long-term effect on PSQ. The impact of a crisis also depends on the prior trend in objective service performance.","Maarten J. Gijsenberg, Harald J. Van Heerde, Peter C.

Feeling Love and Doing More for Distant Others: Specific Positive Emotions Differentially Affect Prosocial Consumption,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0219,01-Oct-15,01-Oct-15,52,5,657,673,"Marketers often employ a variety of positive emotions to encourage consumption or promote a particular behavior (e.g., buying, donating, recycling) to benefit an organization or cause. The authors show that specific positive emotions do not universally increase prosocial behavior but, rather, encourage different types of prosocial behavior. Four studies show that whereas positive emotions (i.e., love, hope, pride, and compassion) all induce prosocial behavior toward close entities (relative to a neutral emotional state), only love induces prosocial behavior toward distant others and international organizations. Love's effect is driven by a distinct form of broadening, characterized by extending feelings of social connection and the boundary of caring to be more inclusive of others regardless of relatedness. Love—as a trait and a momentary emotion—is unique among positive emotions in fostering connectedness that other positive emotions (hope and pride) do not and broadening behavior in a way that other connected emotions (compassion) do not. This research contributes to the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotion by demonstrating a distinct type of broadening for love and adds an important qualification to the general finding that positive emotions uniformly encourage prosocial behavior.","Lisa A.

Using data covering a Dutch supermarket price war (2003–2005), the authors find that price reductions, especially deep reductions, trigger media coverage of the price conflict. This sets off a chain of reactions. Press messages have a significant effect on market share and abnormal stock returns, beyond retailers' own price and advertising. Importantly, this study uncovers striking asymmetries regarding the kind of coverage to which stakeholders react: whereas consumers only respond to the tone of price-related press coverage, retailers and investors only react to its quantity. Next, media coverage feeds back into the retailers' pricing actions: more media coverage triggers new price cuts in addition to those dictated by competitive reactions. As such, media coverage triggers a deeper spiral of price cuts, intensifying the competitive price battle. However, as the price war progresses, media coverage becomes less frequent and less favorable, which decelerates the downward price spiral.","Harald J.

Going Public: How Stock Market Listing Changes Firm Innovation Behavior,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0289,01-Oct-15,01-Oct-15,52,5,694,709,"Although going public allows firms access to more financial capital that can fuel innovation, it also exposes them to a set of myopic incentives and disclosure requirements that constrain innovation. This tension is expected to produce a unique pattern of innovation strategies among firms going public, causing such firms to increase their innovation levels but reduce their innovation riskiness. Specifically, the authors predict that after going public, firms innovate at higher levels and introduce higher levels of variety with each innovation; however, these innovations are less risky, characterized by fewer breakthrough innovations and fewer innovations in new-to-the-firm categories. The authors compare 40,000 product introductions in the period 1980–2011 from a sample of consumer packaged goods firms that went public with a benchmark sample of firms that remained private, and the results support their predictions. Utilizing tests to resolve questions about endogeneity, including self-selection, reverse causality, and competing explanations, the authors demonstrate that initial public offering selection and dynamics do not drive this going-public effect.

Almost 144,000 m-coupons were delivered during the trial, representing 38 stores that supplied 134 different coupons. The authors find that an important feature of m-coupons is where and when they are delivered, with location and time of delivery significantly influencing redemption. How long the m-coupons are valid (expiry length) is also important because redemption times for m-coupons are much shorter than for traditional coupons. This finding suggests that their expiration length should be shortened to help signal time urgency. Nevertheless, traditional coupon features, such as face value, still dominate m-coupon effectiveness, as does the product type, with snack food coupons being particularly effective.","Peter J.

Yet focal (own) location targeting may cannibalize profits on inframarginal sales. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of competitive locational targeting, the practice of promoting to consumers near a competitor's location. The analysis is based on a randomized field experiment in which mobile promotions were sent to customers at three similar shopping areas (competitive, focal, and benchmark locations). The results show that competitive locational targeting can take advantage of heightened demand that a focal retailer would not otherwise capture. Competitive locational targeting produced increasing returns to promotional discount depth, whereas targeting the focal location produced decreasing returns to deep discounts, indicating saturation effects and profit cannibalization. These findings are important for marketers, who can use competitive locational targeting to generate incremental sales without cannibalizing profits. Although the experiment focuses on the effects of unilateral promotions, it represents an initial step in understanding the competitive implications of mobile marketing technologies.","Nathan M.

However, the value of these methods in predicting advertising success remains underresearched. Using a unique experimental protocol to assess responses to 30-second television ads, the authors capture many measures of advertising effectiveness across six commonly used methods (traditional self-reports, implicit measures, eye tracking, biometrics, electroencephalography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging). These measures have been shown to reliably tap into higher-level constructs commonly used in advertising research: attention, affect, memory, and desirability. Using time-series data on sales and gross rating points, the authors attempt to relate individual-level response to television ads in the lab to the ads’ aggregate, market-level elasticities. The authors show that functional magnetic resonance imaging measures explain the most variance in advertising elasticities beyond the baseline traditional measures.

That is, as opposed to being constructed through reflective processes, brand personality traits seem to exist a priori inside consumers’ minds, such that the authors are able to predict what brand a person is thinking about solely on the basis of the relationship between brand personality associations and brain activity.

During functional magnetic resonance imaging, the price of a product was shown to participants either before or after the product itself was presented. Early exposure to price, or “price primacy,” altered the process of valuation, as observed in altered patterns of activity in the medial prefrontal cortex immediately before making a purchase decision. Specifically, whereas viewing products first resulted in evaluations strongly related to products’ attractiveness or desirability, viewing prices first appeared to promote overall evaluations related to products’ monetary worth. Consistent with this framework, the authors show that price primacy can increase purchase of bargain-priced products when their worth is easily recognized. Together, these results suggest that price primacy highlights considerations of product worth and can thereby influence purchasing.","Uma R.

However, the applicability of this method to consumer marketing research remains uncertain, partly because of the expense required. In this article, the authors demonstrate that neural measurements made with a relatively low-cost and widely available measurement method—electroencephalography (EEG)—can predict future choices of consumer products. In the experiment, participants viewed individual consumer products in isolation, without making any actual choices, while their neural activity was measured with EEG. At the end of the experiment, participants were offered choices between pairs of the same products. The authors find that neural activity measured from a midfrontal electrode displays an increase in the N200 component and a weaker theta band power that correlates with a more preferred product. Using recent techniques for relating neural measurements to choice prediction, they demonstrate that these measures predict subsequent choices. Moreover, the accuracy of prediction depends on both the ordinal and cardinal distance of the EEG data; the larger the difference in EEG activity between two products, the better the predictive accuracy.","Ariel Telpaz, Ryan Webb, Dino J.

Dissimilar brain responses occurred in the Together but not the Alone condition for the P2 and P3 components over visual cortex sites. The LPP amplitude was higher for luxury than for basic branded products, but only in the Together condition, suggesting that the presence of another person magnifies the emotional effect of brand type.

The results demonstrate that increased activity in the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex in response to peer recommendations is significantly correlated with participants changing their recommendations to be consistent with this feedback within subjects. Furthermore, individual differences in activation of the temporoparietal junction during feedback that peer recommendations varied from those of the participant correlated with individual differences in susceptibility to influence on recommendation decisions between subjects. These brain regions have previously been implicated in social influence and the concept of being a “successful idea salesperson,” respectively.

Core versus Peripheral Innovations: The Effect of Innovation Locus on Consumer Adoption of New Products,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0337,01-Jun-15,01-Jun-15,52,3,309,324,"In four experimental studies, the authors investigate the effect of innovation locus—whether the innovation is integrated with the base product (the core locus) or offered as a detachable accessory (the peripheral locus)—on consumers’ adoption intentions. The findings show that offering a really new innovation (RNI) as a detachable peripheral component leads to higher adoption intentions than integrating the same innovation into the core. Innovation locus, however, does not have an effect on incrementally new innovations. The positive effect of peripheral locus (relative to core locus) for RNIs occurs through four mechanisms: (1) reduced schema incongruity, (2) lower risk perceptions, (3) increased benefit understanding, and (4) greater perceived usage flexibility associated with the new product. The authors demonstrate these effects by using stimuli from four product categories and including both attitudinal and behavioral measures of innovation adoption.

The authors show that, under certain conditions, the strategic firms charge higher prices and accrue smaller equilibrium profits than their nonstrategic counterparts. Strategic firms’ efforts to capitalize on their loyal customers’ higher willingness to pay increases nonstrategic firms’ share of price-sensitive consumers. Furthermore, by raising prices, strategic firms help their nonstrategic counterparts more than themselves.

Contrary to this, the authors find that when the budget contracts to a particular level, consumers select less variety (as measured by the number of different items with some of the budget allocated to them) than when their budget expands to that same level. This budget contraction effect stems from a reduction in variety under the contracting budget, not from variety expansion under the expanding budget. Evidence from five experiments indicates that the effect is driven by a desire to avoid feelings of loss associated with spreading allocation cuts (relative to reference quantities from previous allocations) across many items.","Kurt A.

Specifically, in a series of studies, the authors show that high rather than low need for cognitive closure can lead to a lack of openness to new information and therefore may dilute consumers’ tendency to update their investment portfolios in a way that reflects their risk preferences.

Five experiments demonstrate that perceiving greater conflict between goals makes people feel time constrained and that stress and anxiety drive this effect. These effects, which generalize across a variety of goals and types of conflict (both related and unrelated to demands on time), influence how consumers spend time as well as how much they are willing to pay to save time.

Direct and Indirect Effects of Buyers and Sellers on Search Advertising Revenues in Business-to-Business Electronic Platforms,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0165,01-Jun-15,01-Jun-15,52,3,407,422,"Platform companies such as Alibaba.com increasingly rely on search advertising as a revenue source. This study examines (1) the direct effect of new and existing buyers and sellers on platform advertising revenue, (2) their indirect effect through two intermediary performance variables (buyer's click rate and seller's click price), and (3) how the effects differ between launch and mature stages of the search advertising service. Unique data collected from a leading transactional business-to-business electronic platform suggest that new buyers click on more search advertisements than existing buyers, especially after the firm's buyers and sellers have learned and adapted to the service (mature stage). New sellers tend to outbid existing sellers in the mature stage, but the opposite is true when the service is newly introduced (launch stage). Because existing sellers can more effectively send quality signals in the launch stage, attracting existing, rather than new, sellers has a greater effect on click rate in the launch stage; however, the opposite is true in the mature stage. Attracting new buyers also has a greater effect on click rate and price, especially in the mature stage.

An initial set of three experiments demonstrates that, compared with a control condition free of the consideration of either resource, money consideration generates significantly more violations of transitivity in product choice, while time consideration has no such impact. The next three experiments use multiple approaches to demonstrate the role of different processing modes associated with money versus time consideration in this result.

They estimate a learning model of store price image (SPI) formation with the impact of actual prices linked to category characteristics on a unique data set combining consumers’ store visit and purchase information with their price perceptions. The results identify characteristics that drive categories’ store price signaling power for different store formats. “Big ticket” categories with a narrow price range strongly shape consumers’ store price beliefs, whereas (volatile) prices of frequently or deeply promoted categories are less influential. At traditional supermarkets, consumers anchor and elaborate on prices of storable categories bought in large quantities and for which quality differentiation is high. For hard discounters, however, SPI is mostly shaped by frequently bought categories with narrow assortments. Notably, categories’ SPI signaling power is not proportional to their share of wallet at either type of chain. Managers can use these results to identify “Lighthouse” categories that signal low prices, yet make up a small portion of store spending, and in which price cuts do not overly hurt revenue.","Carlos J.S.

To test the hypotheses, the authors model a customer's retention and usage decisions, distinguishing usage of a flat-rate service and usage of a pay-per-use service. The model allows for unobserved heterogeneity and corrects for selection effects and endogeneity. Using household panel data from a digital television service, the authors find systematic behavioral differences that cause the average customer lifetime value of free-trial customers to be 59% lower than that of regular customers. However, free-trial customers are more responsive to marketing communication and usage rates, which offers opportunities to target marketing efforts and enhance retention rates, customer lifetime value, and customer equity.","Hannes Datta, Bram Foubert, Harald J.

The results of the present investigation, however, show exactly the opposite. First, the authors find that managerial empathy ironically accelerates self-reference in predictions of consumer preferences. Second, managers’ self-referential tendencies increase with empathy because taking a consumer perspective activates managers’ private consumer identity and, thus, their personal consumption preferences. Third, empathic managers’ self-referential preference predictions make them less likely to use market research results. Fourth, the findings imply that when explicitly instructed to do so, managers are capable of suppressing their private consumer identity in the process of perspective taking, which helps them reduce self-referential preference predictions. To support their conclusions, the authors present four empirical studies with 480 experienced marketing managers and show that incautiously taking the perspective of consumers causes self-referential decisions in four contexts: product development, communication management, pricing, and celebrity endorsement.","Johannes D.

The authors develop a mathematical model of redemption choice that unites three explanations for why customers seem to be motivated to stockpile on their own, even though the retailer does not reward them for doing so. These motivations are economic (the value of forgone points), cognitive (nonmonetary transaction costs), and psychological (customers value points differently than cash). The authors capture the psychological motivation by allowing customers to book cash and point transactions in separate mental accounts. They estimate the model on data from an international retailer using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and accurately forecast redemptions during an 11-month out-of-sample period. The results indicate substantial heterogeneity in how customers are motivated to redeem and suggest that the behavior in the data is driven mostly by cognitive and psychological incentives.","Valeria Stourm, Eric T.

Even when they do include this metric, increases in product return behavior are usually considered merely an economic cost that must be managed by decreasing the marketing resource allocations toward the customers making the returns. However, recent research has suggested that satisfactory product return experiences can actually benefit firms by lowering the customer's perceived risk of current and future purchases. To better understand the role of this perceived risk in the firm–customer exchange process, the authors conduct a large-scale customer selection and optimal resource allocation field experiment with 26,000 customers from an online retailer over six months. They find that the firm is able to increase both its short-and long-term profits when accounting for the perceived risk related to product returns in addition to managing product return costs.

The results from five experiments show that scarcity versus abundance broadens the discrepancy between the liking of the favorite and nonfavorite items and leads to a greater choice share of the favorite item. The findings provide support for the arousal-based explanation, showing that the effect of scarcity salience on choices is mediated by consumers’ reported arousal level and moderated by an experimentally induced arousal state.","Meng Zhu, Rebecca K.

They posit that this phenomenon occurs because referencing a hedonic product during a charitable appeal changes the self-attributions, or self-signaling utility, associated with the choice to donate. A series of hypothetical and actual choice experiments demonstrate the predicted effect and show that the increase in donation rates occurs because the self-attributions signaled by a choice not to donate are more negative in the context of a hedonic reference product. Finally, consistent with these experimental findings, a field experiment shows that referencing a hedonic product during a charitable appeal increases real donation rates in a nonlaboratory setting.

Novel features in the authors’ model include consumers’ ability to anticipate the media's incentives for slant and the requirement that all media stances must be supported by facts. Furthermore, consumers find reports with more facts to be more convincing. Despite consumers’ ability to detect slant and their demand for factual support, the research shows that competition results in consumers reading fewer facts and being unable to update their prior beliefs about the state of the world.

When buyers care about their surplus relative to seller profits but are uncertain about seller costs, buyers’ fairness perceptions and, thus, their willingness to pay may be malleable and susceptible to seller influence. If a seller's optimal behavior (e.g., pricing) is not completely unvarying in variable costs, buyers can rationally make inferences about seller costs from observed seller behavior. Consequently, buyers’ fairness perceptions and their willingness to pay can influence, and be influenced by, optimal selling strategies. The study characterizes a fair selling equilibrium in which optimal seller behavior and buyer perceived fairness are interactively derived. The author shows that seller ex ante profit may increase as more buyers become inequity averse. In addition, buyer ex ante surplus can be nonmonotonically influenced by an increase in the number of fair-minded buyers or in the degree of inequity aversion. These counterintuitive results pinpoint the importance of investigating the strategic interaction between buyer fairness perceptions and selling strategies. Finally, the basic model is extended to examine how the fair selling equilibrium may be influenced by cost disclosure, buyer dynamic learning, and seller competition.",Liang Guo,"behavioral economics, distributional fairness, inequity aversion, reference price, pricing",0
The Braggart's Dilemma: On the Social Rewards and Penalties of Advertising Prosocial Behavior,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0002,01-Feb-15,01-Feb-15,52,1,90,104,"People often brag about, or advertise, their good deeds to others.

The authors propose that bragging conveys information about an actor's good deeds, leading to an attribution of generosity. However, bragging also signals a selfish motivation (a desire for credit) that undermines the attribution of generosity. Thus, bragging has a positive effect when prosocial behavior is unknown because it informs others that an actor has behaved generously. However, bragging does not help—and often hurts—when prosocial behavior is already known, because it signals a selfish motive. In addition, the authors demonstrate that conspicuous cause marketing products have effects akin to bragging by signaling an impure motive for doing good deeds. Finally, the authors argue that bragging about prosocial behavior is unique because it undermines the precise information that the braggart is trying to convey (generosity).

This difference in construal level also affects product choices that involve trade-offs between long-term benefits and short-term effort. The authors address alternative accounts such as vertical distance, visual distance, and perceived power. By highlighting the novel relationship between height and construal level, these findings contribute to research on grounded cognition and construal-level theory while also providing practical suggestions to marketing managers across a variety of domains.","Pankaj Aggarwal, Min Zhao","construal level, consumer preference, processing style, physical height, grounded cognition",35

Through lab and field studies, the authors demonstrate that highlighting a large competitor's size and close proximity can help smaller brands rather than harm them. The results show that support for small brands goes up when faced with a competitive threat from large brands versus when they are in competition with brands that are similar to them or when consumers view them outside a competitive context. This support translates into purchase intentions, real purchases, and more favorable online reviews in a study of more than 10,000 Yelp posts. The authors argue that this “framing-the-game effect” is mediated by consumers' motivation to express their views and have an impact in the marketplace through their purchase choices.","Neeru Paharia, Jill Avery, Anat Keinan","branding, brand management, positioning, competition, consumer behavior",14

The authors' premise is that such a narrow focus does not capture the complete impact of brand imitation. They offer a broader, theory-based perspective of harm by proposing that brand imitation affects both brand consideration and preference in the consumer choice process. The authors establish a formal nexus between brand consideration and the legal doctrine “initial interest confusion.” Using choice experiments and statistical modeling, they show that brand imitation harms the imitated brand even after controlling for brand confusion. Moreover, brand imitation harms not only the imitated brand but also other national brands in the category that are not being imitated. To quantify brand consideration and preference harm in financial terms, the authors propose two metrics: choice share shift and share-equalizing price cut. The results show that brand imitation harms the national brand more when the imitating brand is not associated with a well-known retailer and that brand imitation harm extends beyond brand confusion. The proposed framework provides both legal and managerial guidance.","Anocha Aribarg, Neeraj Arora, Ty Henderson,...","trade dress infringement, brand confusion, brand equity, private label, brand similarity",0

Executives value being associated with strong brands and, therefore, accept substantially lower pay at firms that own strong brands. Consistent with identity theory, this effect is stronger for chief executive officers and younger executives than for other executives. Data from a large, cross-industry sample of executives suggest that academics and practitioners should take a broader view of the contributions of brand-related investments to firm value and make use of strong brands in pay negotiations that are typically viewed as being outside the realm of marketing.","Nader T.

Consistent with prior research, the aggregate analyses indicate that brand equity, as measured by customer mindset metrics, positively affects current financial performance. In addition, the author documents brand equity's significant and much greater impact on the firm's future financial performance: at the aggregate, only a small portion of the total financial impact of brand equity is reflected in current-year profits, whereas the bulk of the profitability impact is realized in the future.

Product Customization via Starting Solutions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0437,01-Dec-14,01-Dec-14,51,6,707,725,"Customizing a product by choosing each of its attributes individually tends to be onerous for consumers, and the benefits of product customization may thus be offset by an increase in choice complexity. As a remedy for this dilemma, the current research introduces the customization via starting solutions (CvSS) architecture, which substantially reduces the complexity of product customization while preserving all of its advantages. Under CvSS, consumers first select one starting solution from a set of prespecified products, which they then refine to create their final customized product. Evidence from nine studies (three of which were conducted in field settings) across a wide range of product domains (shirts, cars, vacation packages, jewelry, and financial products) shows that the CvSS architecture results in substantial benefits relative to the standard attribute-by-attribute product customization format for both consumers (increased satisfaction with their product choices, reduced choice complexity, and enhanced mental simulation of product use) and firms (purchases of more feature-rich, and thus higher-priced, products).","Christian Hildebrand, Gerald Häubl, Andreas Herrmann","product customization, consumer decision making, choice architecture, field experiments",14

The findings underscore the need for managers to consider customer habits beyond repeat purchases, take stock of customers' habit measures before implementing policy changes, and leverage the habit measures (as compared with using only traditional behavioral measures) to strategically allocate resources at the customer level to maximize customer and firm profits.","Denish Shah, V.

First, the authors conduct a preliminary study to identify sets of more and less annoying ads. Second, in a field experiment, they calculate the compensating differential, that is, the amount of money a publisher would need to pay users to generate the same number of impressions in the presence of annoying ads as it would generate in their absence. Third, the authors conduct a mouse-tracking study to investigate how annoying ads affect reading processes. They conclude that in plausible scenarios, the practice of running annoying ads can cost more money than it earns.","Daniel G. Goldstein, Siddharth Suri, R.

Take Turns or March in Sync?

However, there is increasing concern about the net sales and revenue gains from these promotions, because retailers and manufacturers may simply be subsidizing consumers who shop around. Thus, the (co-)occurrence of a brand's promotions across retailers has been placed high on the promotion-planning agenda. This article examines the mechanisms underlying out-of-phase versus in-phase schedules and empirically demonstrates their sales and revenue implications in four product categories, covering purchases of a national panel of households across eight years. The results reveal that calendar effects primarily materialize in categories in which the chosen retailer is driven by brand promotions. In those categories, alternating the timing of featured price cuts across chains substantially increases the manufacturer and retailers' immediate sales lift. However, with regard to net gains, striving for out-of-phase promotions—the dominant approach among chains—is not necessarily the best practice, because retailers observe the revenue advantage diminish, and manufacturers may even earn less.","Jonne Y.

The authors demonstrate that an unhealthy surcharge, which highlights both the financial disincentive and potential health costs, can significantly drive healthier consumption choices. From a policy and government perspective, if the goal is to reduce demand for unhealthy food, increasing the transparency of the health rationale for any financial disincentive is necessary to effectively lower unhealthy food consumption.","Avni M.

A field experiment shows that a 75% contingent match (such that matches “kick in” only if 75% of others donate) is most effective in increasing commitment to recurring donations. An online experiment reveals that the 75% contingent match drives commitment to recurring donations because it simultaneously provides social proof while offering a low enough target to remain plausible that the match will occur. A final online experiment demonstrates that the effectiveness of the 75% contingent match extends to one-time donations.

This situation requires firms to understand how advertising in one channel (e.g., online) influences sales in another channel (e.g., offline). This article studies the presence, magnitude, and carryover of these cross-channel effects for online advertising (display and search) and traditional media. The analysis considers how these advertising expenditures translate directly into sales, as well as indirectly through intermediate search advertising metrics—namely, impressions and click-through rate. For a high-end clothing and apparel retailer, the authors find that cross effects exist and are important and that cross-effect elasticities are almost as high as own-effect elasticities. Online display and, in particular, search advertising is more effective than traditional advertising. This result is primarily due to strong cross effects on the offline channel. Return-on-investment calculations suggest that by ignoring these cross effects, firms substantially miscalculate the effectiveness of online advertising. Notably, the authors find that traditional advertising decreases paid search click-through rates, thus reducing the net cross effect of traditional advertising.","Isaac M. Dinner, Harald J.

The authors propose that these prior experiences serve as multiple reference points against which the target stimulus is judged, creating rival co-occurring comparison effects. Using real-world and experimental data, they find that assimilation and contrast effects occur simultaneously: there is assimilation to the first score within a sequence and contrast with the immediate predecessor as well as with extremes experienced earlier in the sequence. The authors document the moderating effects of extreme first stimuli, domain similarity, and individual factors of mood and expertise. They provide different recommendations for sequence construction on the basis of whether the marketer's goal is fairness, accuracy, or influencing choice.

Using a unique and rich data set comprising 20 campaigns across a variety of industries, this study demonstrates that Internet ads perform on par with television ads on the brand-building metrics that advertisers use and trust. The authors extend traditional brand–message recall measurements to facilitate comparisons between Internet formats and television by supplementing brand–message surveys conducted during the campaign with a set of precampaign surveys to control for preexisting brand knowledge. They find that accounting for differences in preexisting brand knowledge is paramount in obtaining valid comparisons across advertising formats because people who are exposed to Internet display ads have significantly lower levels of preexisting brand knowledge than television viewers. Without considering the differences in these “initial conditions,” television advertising seems to be more effective than advertising on the Internet, but when the preexisting differences among media formats are taken into account, the brand recall lift measures for Internet ads are statistically indistinguishable from comparable television lift measures.","Michaela Draganska, Wesley R.

The authors propose a forward-looking and profit-oriented metric to evaluate and demonstrate the effects of training type and incentive type on a salesperson's future value. Using a latent class modeling approach, they identify two distinct segments in the sales force that exhibit different responses to varying levels of training and incentives. This suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach to sales force management may be suboptimal. Finally, the authors also evaluate the magnitude of the proposed effects in the short run as well as the long run and show that the magnitudes of the effects could vary depending on the time horizon being considered.

Information Asymmetry and Hybrid Advertising,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0074,01-Oct-13,01-Oct-14,51,5,609,624,"Pay-for-performance (P4P) pricing schemes such as pay per click and pay per action have increased in popularity in Internet advertising. Meanwhile, pay-per-impression (PPI) schemes persist, and several publishers have begun to offer a hybrid mix of PPI and P4P schemes. Given the proliferation of pricing schemes, this study examines the optimal choices for publishers. The authors highlight two-sided information asymmetries in online advertising markets and the consequent trade-offs faced by a high-quality publisher using P4P schemes. Pay-for-performance schemes enable a high-quality publisher to reveal its superior quality; however, such schemes may incur allocative inefficiencies stemming from inaccurate estimates of advertiser qualities. The authors identify conditions under which a publisher may opt for a PPI, P4P, or hybrid scheme and, in doing so, provide theoretical explanations for the observed variations in the pricing schemes and the increasing popularity of hybrid schemes. Using a new “uncompromised” equilibrium refinement, the authors find that the hybrid scheme can emerge as an equilibrium choice in a variety of conditions. In addition, they provide prescriptive guidelines for firms choosing between different pricing schemes.","De Liu, Siva Viswanathan","online advertising, pay for performance, information asymmetry, hybrid pricing",0
The Role of Chief Marketing Officers for Venture Capital Funding: Endowing New Ventures with Marketing Legitimacy,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0350,01-Oct-13,01-Oct-14,51,5,625,644,"Research on new ventures has indicated that poorly conducted marketing is among the main reasons for new venture failure. To acquire urgently needed initial funding, new ventures strive to conform to investors’ expectations of appropriate marketing capabilities because these capabilities may endow them with legitimacy in the eyes of potential investors. Drawing on organizational legitimacy and human resource theory, the authors argue that the characteristics of the chief marketing officer (CMO) may endow new ventures with marketing legitimacy. Employing a two-stage selection hazard rate analysis to simultaneously account for potential selection bias and right-censored observations, the authors analyze a comprehensive data set of 2,945 high-technology new ventures. Bearing in mind that this research is a first exploratory attempt to illuminate the role of marketing for new venture funding using correlational secondary data, the results indicate that CMO education, marketing experience, and industry experience are positively related to the likelihood of funding. Moreover, the relationships between CMO characteristics and funding are contingent on task-related uncertainty and industry legitimacy.

Using social media data from firms in two distinct industries, they allow the content of the post and the underlying sentiment toward the brand to affect both processes. The results show that the inferences marketing researchers obtain from monitoring social media are dependent on where they “listen” and that common approaches that either focus on a single social media venue or ignore differences across venues in aggregated data can lead to misleading brand sentiment metrics. The authors validate the approach by comparing their model-based measure of brand sentiment with performance measures obtained from external data sets (stock prices for both brands and an offline brand-tracking study for one brand). They find that their measure of sentiment serves as a leading indicator of the changes observed in these external data sources and outperforms other social media metrics currently used.","David A.

Through such multivariate dependences, this model significantly improves the predictive performance of the opt-out time in comparison with several benchmark models.

Such information had greater influence on subsequent judgments (e.g., of the next day's weather, of the hotel's quality) than identical information not framed as a first.

The present research demonstrates conditions under which consumers exhibit similar behaviors to dissociative out-group members in the domain of positive consumption behaviors. In particular, when a consumer learns that a dissociative out-group performs comparatively well on a positive behavior, the consumer is more likely to respond with positive intentions and actions when the setting is public (vs. private). The authors suggest that this occurs because learning of the successful performance of a dissociative out-group under public conditions threatens the consumer's group image and activates the desire to present the group image in a positive light. The authors show that although group affirmation mitigates these effects, self-affirmation does not. They also examine the moderating role of the positivity of the behavior and the mediating role of group image motives. Taken together, the results highlight conditions under which communicating information about the behaviors of dissociative out-groups can be used to spur consumers to engage in positive actions.","Katherine White, Bonnie Simpson, Jennifer J.

The authors incorporate these three circumstantial variables into a formal two-stage economic model and find that consumers who travel farther and make reservations during business hours are more likely to select higher-quality hotels but are less satisfied. Consumers who book earlier are more likely to select higher-quality hotels and are more satisfied.

Mining Marketing Meaning from Online Chatter: Strategic Brand Analysis of Big Data Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0106,01-Aug-14,01-Aug-14,51,4,463,479,"Online chatter, or user-generated content, constitutes an excellent emerging source for marketers to mine meaning at a high temporal frequency.

The authors propose a unified framework for this purpose using unsupervised latent Dirichlet allocation. The sample of user-generated content consists of rich data on product reviews across 15 firms in five markets over four years. The results suggest that a few dimensions with good face validity and external validity are enough to capture quality. Dynamic analysis enables marketers to track dimensions’ importance over time and allows for dynamic mapping of competitive brand positions on those dimensions over time. For vertically differentiated markets (e.g., mobile phones, computers), objective dimensions dominate and are similar across markets, heterogeneity is low across dimensions, and stability is high over time. For horizontally differentiated markets (e.g., shoes, toys), subjective dimensions dominate but vary across markets, heterogeneity is high across dimensions, and stability is low over time.","Seshadri Tirunillai, Gerard J.

However, searches of less popular keywords (i.e., keywords with lower search volume) are associated with more clicks per search and a larger fraction of sponsored clicks. This indicates that, compared with more popular keywords, consumers who search for less popular keywords expend more effort in their search for information and are closer to a purchase, which makes them more targetable for sponsored search advertising.","Kinshuk Jerath, Liye Ma, Young-Hoon Park","sponsored search advertising, organic search listing, click-through behavior, keyword search volume",26
The Limits of Attraction,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0061,01-Aug-14,01-Aug-14,51,4,487,507,"Consumer research has documented dozens of instances in which the introduction of an “irrelevant” third option affects preferences between the remaining two. In nearly all such cases, the unattractive dominated option enhances the attractiveness of the option it most resembles—a phenomenon known as the “attraction effect.” In the studies presented here, however, the authors contend that this phenomenon may be restricted to stylized product representations in which every product dimension is represented by a number (e.g., a toaster oven that has a durability rating of 7.2 and ease of cleaning rating of 5.5). Such effects do not typically occur when consumers experience the product (e.g., taste a drink) or when even one of the product attributes is represented perceptually (e.g., differently priced hotel rooms whose quality is depicted with a photo). The authors posit that perceptual representations of attributes do not support the sorts of comparisons that drive the attraction effect with highly stylized examples, and they question the practical significance of the effect.","Shane Frederick, Leonard Lee, Ernest Baskin","attraction effect, context effects, attribute representation, consumer choice, asymmetric dominance",18
More Evidence Challenging the Robustness and Usefulness of the Attraction Effect,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0020,01-Aug-14,01-Aug-14,51,4,508,513,"Ninety-one attempts to produce an attraction effect (involving a total of 23 product classes and 73 different decoyed choice sets) produced only 11 reliable effects—significantly fewer than expected given the statistical power of the studies. Cross-scenario analyses indicated that the use of meaningful qualitative-verbal descriptions, as well as pictorial depictions, to differentiate choice options substantially reduced the size of those effects. Indeed, the authors found attraction effects at only chance levels using these types of stimuli. The article concludes with a brief discussion of the implications of these findings for both marketing practice and research.","Sybil Yang, Michael Lynn","decoys, attraction effect, decision making, consumer behavior, product positioning",3
Vices and Virtues of Misguided Replications: The Case of Asymmetric Dominance,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0093,01-Aug-14,01-Aug-14,51,4,514,519,"The likelihood of replicating an effect such as asymmetric dominance (AD) largely depends on other, usually more important choice drivers (e.g., attributes, values). Accordingly, it is not surprising that the AD effect is often not observed when other choice drivers have greater impact and/or when the AD configuration is unlikely to be perceived. However, when price is an attribute (and in many other cases), the AD effect is often observed in both properly designed studies and the real world. The author notes that Frederick, Lee, and Baskin (2014) raise important questions, but they would have made a greater contribution had they (1) systematically studied the drivers of AD perceptions, (2) more accurately tried to replicate previous AD effect demonstrations, and (3) systematically studied the repulsion effect.

Let's be Honest about the Attraction Effect,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.14.0208,01-Aug-14,01-Aug-14,51,4,520,525,"Frederick, Lee, and Baskin (2014) and Yang and Lynn (2014) argue that the conditions for obtaining the attraction effect are so restrictive that the practical validity of the attraction effect should be questioned. In this commentary, the authors first ground the attraction (asymmetric dominance) effect in its historical context as a test of an important theoretical assumption from rational choice theory. Drawing on the research reported by scholars from many fields of study, the authors argue that the finding of an asymmetric dominance effect remains robust because it holds when the conditions of the study are essentially replicated. Next, the authors identify some of the factors that mitigate (and amplify) the attraction effect and then position the effect into a larger theoretical debate involving the extent to which preferences are constructed versus merely revealed. The authors conclude by arguing that researchers who try to measure values as well as choice architects who attempt to shape values must be sensitive to the context-dependent properties of choice behavior, as illustrated by the attraction effect.","Joel Huber, John W.

These reviews are significantly more negative than other reviews. They are also less likely to contain expressions describing the fit or feel of the items and more likely to contain linguistic cues associated with deception. More than 12,000 of the firm's best customers have written reviews without confirmed transactions. On average, these customers have each made more than 150 purchases from the firm. This makes it unlikely that the reviews were written by the employees or agents of a competitor and suggests that deceptive reviews may not be limited to the strategic actions of firms. Instead, the phenomenon may be far more prevalent, extending to individual customers who have no financial incentive to influence product ratings.","Eric T. Anderson, Duncan I.

Which Products Are Best Suited to Mobile Advertising? A Field Study of Mobile Display Advertising Effects on Consumer Attitudes and Intentions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0503,01-Jun-14,01-Jun-14,51,3,270,285,"Mobile advertising is one of the fastest-growing advertising formats. In 2013, global spending on mobile advertising was approximately $16.7 billion, and it is expected to exceed $62.8 billion by 2017. The most prevalent type of mobile advertising is mobile display advertising (MDA), which takes the form of banners on mobile web pages and in mobile applications. This article examines which product characteristics are likely to be associated with MDA campaigns that are effective in increasing consumers’ (1) favorable attitudes toward products and (2) purchase intentions. Data from a large-scale test-control field experiment covering 54 U.S. MDA campaigns that ran between 2007 and 2010 and involved 39,946 consumers show that MDA campaigns significantly increased consumers’ favorable attitudes and purchase intentions only when the campaigns advertised products that were higher (vs. lower) involvement and utilitarian (vs. hedonic). The authors explain this finding using established theories of information processing and persuasion and suggest that when MDAs work effectively, they do so by triggering consumers to recall and process previously stored product information.","Yakov Bart, Andrew T.

Six studies demonstrate that compared with narrowcasting (i.e., communicating with just one person), broadcasting (i.e., communicating with multiple people) leads consumers to avoid sharing content that makes them look bad. Narrowcasting, however, encourages people to share content that is useful to the message recipient. These effects are driven by communicators’ focus of attention. People naturally tend to focus on the self, but communicating with just one person heightens other-focus, which leads communicators to share less self-presenting content and more useful content. These findings shed light on the drivers of word of mouth and provide insight into when the communication sender (vs. receiver) plays a relatively larger role in what people share.","Alixandra Barasch, Jonah Berger","word of mouth, self-presentation, self-focus, other-focus, audience size",19

Consequently, most advertising response models have focused directly on sales and ignored other purchase funnel activities. The authors demonstrate, in the context of the U.S. automotive market, how consumer online search volume data from Google Trends can be combined with sales data to decompose advertising's overall impact into two underlying components: its impacts on (1) generating consumer interest in prepurchase information search and (2) converting that interest into sales. The authors show that this decompositional approach, implemented through a novel state-space model that simultaneously examines sales and search volumes, offers important advantages over a benchmark model that considers sales data alone. First, the approach improves goodness-of-fit, both in and out of sample. Second, it improves diagnosticity by distinguishing advertising effectiveness in interest generation from its effectiveness in interest conversion. Third, the authors find that overall advertising elasticity can be biased if researchers consider only sales data.","Ye Hu, Rex Yuxing Du, Sina Damangir","Google Trends, advertising response model, market response model, product information search, dynamic linear model",1
When Do Group Incentives for Salespeople Work?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0322,01-Jun-14,01-Jun-14,51,3,320,334,"When should sales managers employ group incentives rather than individual incentives to motivate their sales force? Using economic experiments, the authors show that two-person group incentives can outperform individual incentives and that the relative efficacy of group incentives depends on three important factors. First, the strength of social ties among the group members matters. Effort decisions in group-based incentives increase significantly when members socialize briefly before committing effort. Second, the design of the group incentive matters. For the group incentive to work better than the individual incentive, the group-based component (i.e., how much the payment scheme weights the contribution of others) in the former cannot be too large. Third, the informational feedback that group members receive matters. When socialized group members can observe one another's true effort, rather than only their output, effort surprisingly decreases. The authors show that a model that accounts for social preferences and the psychological loss that occurs when teammates underestimate one's effort can explain salesperson behavior in group incentives well.","Noah Lim, Hua Chen","sales management, group incentives, experimental economics, behavioral economics",7
PIE: A Holistic Preference Concept and Measurement Model,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0406,01-Jun-14,01-Jun-14,51,3,335,351,"Extant preference measurement research, including conjoint analysis, has been silent on the explicit influence of others in the formation of consumer preferences. This article proposes a new holistic framework of preference, “PIE,” as well as a measurement method to remedy this problem. The new paradigm posits that consumers evaluate products on the basis of different “needs” determined by three sources: (1) P, the physical attributes of the product; (2) I, the individual characteristics of the choice maker; and (3) E, characteristics of an external peer group. To provide an empirically feasible method to capture all three sources of information, the authors propose and test an incentive-aligned approach, a “group-sourced mechanism,” which mimics a consumer's real-life consultation in the presence of his or her friends when making a purchase decision. The results provide support for the PIE framework, including superior predictive performance in a conjoint task that is “stacked against it.” The authors also show how firms can apply the PIE framework for product design. Practitioners, however, must carefully weigh the benefits of the group-sourced preference measurement with the heavier cognitive burden on the respondents in completing the task.","Hye-Jin Kim, Young-Hoon Park, Eric T.

Shopper Loyalty to Whom?

This distinction is important in a dynamic retail environment: if a store changes ownership, chain loyalty makes customers inclined to seek out another outlet of the former chain, whereas outlet loyalty enhances their stay rate after the takeover. This article distinguishes the two forms of loyalty conceptually and discusses how both can be identified empirically in a model of consumers’ reactions to store acquisitions. The authors estimate their model on unique scanner panel data covering ±200 local markets and takeovers. The results confirm that after an acquisition, consumers exhibit outlet loyalty, regardless of changes in chain and marketing mix. Counterfactual simulations point to important managerial implications. Acquiring outlets with a clientele in place leads to higher store traffic levels than the new owner could otherwise reach. Notably, these benefits cannot be reaped if the acquiring chain is a hard discounter, in which case customers’ previous store knowledge is less relevant, and incentives to seek out new outlets are greater.","Arjen Van Lin, Els Gijsbrechts","store acquisitions, state dependence, choice models, outlet loyalty, takeovers, store choice",0
Authenticity is Contagious: Brand Essence and the Original Source of Production,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0022,01-Jun-14,01-Jun-14,51,3,371,386,"It is well established that differences in manufacturing location can affect consumer preferences through lay inferences about production quality. In this article, the authors take a different approach to this topic by demonstrating how beliefs in contagion (the notion that objects may acquire a special aura or “essence” from their past) influence perceptions of authenticity for everyday consumer products and brands. Specifically, they find that due to a belief in contagion, products from a company's original manufacturing location are viewed as containing the essence of the brand. In turn, this belief in transferred essence leads consumers to view products from the original factory as more authentic and valuable than identical products made elsewhere. The authors further reveal that consumers who are higher in sensitivity to contagion are more likely to exhibit this effect and that activating the concept of contagion enhances preferences for products made in the brand's original factory. The authors close by discussing theoretical and practical implications of these findings.","George E.

Analyzing market orientation at the level of its intelligence and responsiveness facets, they find the responsiveness facet to be positively associated with increases in advertising spending but observe the intelligence facet to be negatively associated with advertising spending. Importantly, positive shifts in advertising spending during the economic contraction predict better subsequent business performance. The opposing roles of the intelligence and responsiveness facets disappear in a subsequent economic expansion period. These findings have managerial and theoretical implications. Firms that nurture the responsiveness facet of market orientation during economic contractions go against the tide to increase their advertising spending and experience the performance benefits that such countercyclical actions can amass.","Peren Özturan, Ayşegül Özsomer, Rik Pieters","economic contraction and expansion, market orientation, responsiveness, advertising spending, proactive marketing",0

The authors propose that higher prices set higher expectations, which serve as reference points. When expectations are met or exceeded, we observe the familiar P–Q relationship. However, when price is high and quality is relatively low, the product falls short of consumers’ reference point and the P–Q relationship is reversed; thus, people evaluate a low-quality product with a high price more negatively than a low-quality product with a low price.

They also find that the graphic warning and a graphic warning × smoking frequency interaction have incremental effects on quit thoughts beyond the effects of fear and negative health beliefs. Using a longitudinal design with a sample of young adult smokers, the authors find support for many of the adolescent smoker findings, particularly the incremental effects of graphicness and its interaction with smoking frequency.

Results from four experiments show that consolation prizes lower consumers’ expectations of winning the big prize, their valuations of the lottery, and their intentions to participate in the lottery. Because of the high likelihood of attaining the consolation prizes, consumers shift their focus from the value of a big prize to the probability of attaining it. This shift increases the weight given to the probability dimension and results in lowered valuations of the lottery. The first two experiments demonstrate the effect in hypothetical and real choices. In Experiment 3, the authors propose and show a boundary condition for the effect. In Experiment 4, they conduct an exploratory test of the process.

Specifically, they find that perceived limited availability made a product more enjoyable, and yet this effect largely emerged only after repeated consumption. The authors attribute this finding to an urge to take advantage of a rare consumption opportunity, which leads people to pay less attention to the quantity consumed and subsequently to experience less satiation. A series of studies establish the effect of perceived limited availability on the rate of satiation, show that it influences how much people eat, provide mediation evidence of the proposed theoretical account, and eliminate the effect by making salient the total amount consumed.

Second, a perceptual decision task (triangle test) assesses the accuracy and speed with which consumers can identify differences between brands from rapidly (300 milliseconds) flashed images of their packages. Third, a competing accumulator model describes the buildup of evidence on each of the alternative brands during consumers’ perceptual decisions and predicts the accuracy and response time of brand identification. Jointly, these components establish the impact of copycat packaging's visual features on consumer confusion. The method is applied in a test of experimentally designed copycats and market copycats in 15 product categories.

Findings from three studies show that women near ovulation seek positional goods to improve their social standing. Additional findings reveal that ovulation leads women to pursue positional goods when doing so improves relative standing compared with other women but not compared with men. When playing the dictator game, for example, ovulating women gave smaller offers to a female partner but not to a male partner.

However, firms still depend on aggregate measures to guide their marketing investments in multiple online channels (e.g., display, paid search, referral, e-mail). This article introduces a methodology to attribute the incremental value of each marketing channel in an online environment using individual-level data of customers’ touches. The authors propose a measurement model to analyze customers’ (1) consideration of online channels, (2) visits through these channels over time, and (3) subsequent purchases at the website to estimate the carryover and spillover effects of prior touches at both the visit and purchase stages. The authors use the estimated carryover and spillover effects to attribute the conversion credit to different channels and find that these channels’ relative contributions are significantly different from those found by other currently used metrics. A field study validates the proposed model's ability to estimate the incremental impact of a channel on conversions. In targeting customers with different patterns of touches in their purchase funnel, these estimates help identify cases in which retargeting strategies may actually decrease conversion probabilities.","Hongshuang (Alice) Li, P.K.

What may be observable, instead, are aggregate diffusion patterns for past products adopted within a particular social network. The authors propose an approach for identifying systematic conditions that are stable across diffusions and thus are “transferrable” to new product introductions within a given network. Using Facebook applications data, the authors show that incorporation of such systematic conditions improves prelaunch forecasts. This research bridges the gap between the disciplines of Bayesian statistics and agent-based modeling by demonstrating how researchers can use stochastic relationships simulated within complex systems as meaningful inputs for Bayesian inference models.","Michael Trusov, William Rand, Yogesh V.

The authors propose that consumers are particularly attracted to offers they perceive as more valuable than the marketer presumably intended. Consistent with this analysis, six experiments indicate that consumers may perceive customized offers that are presented as tailored to their individual preferences or circumstances as less valuable than offers that seem to fit their preferences and provide value without the marketer's explicit intent. The experiments also suggest that the urge to exploit unintended value reflects a competitive desire to outsmart the market. The findings have theoretical implications for understanding consumers’ subjective perceptions of value as well as important practical implications for designing customized offers and targeted promotions.","Aner Sela, Itamar Simonson, Ran Kivetz","value perception, bargains, idiosyncratic fit, customization, persuasion knowledge",2
Asymmetric Roles of Advertising and Marketing Capability in Financial Returns to News: Turning Bad into Good and Good into Great,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0278,01-Dec-13,01-Dec-13,50,6,706,724,"News reports carrying positive or negative sentiment about a firm influence its stock market performance. This study examines how two firm-controllable marketing factors, advertising and marketing capability, moderate the relationship between news stories and firm stock returns. Analysis of a panel data set of more than 7,000 firm-month observations indicates asymmetric and complementary moderating roles of the two marketing variables: advertising reinforces the favorable impact of positive news on abnormal stock returns, and marketing capability mitigates the adverse impact of negative news. Moreover, these moderating effects operate through different stakeholders. Whereas the moderating effect of marketing capability is due to its influence on customers and thus affects the level and volatility of future cash flows, advertising moderates the effect of news through individual investors’ attention and response to the news. The econometric analysis accounts for potential endogeneity between news reports, stock returns, and marketing variables, and the results are robust to alternative measures and analysis approaches. The findings suggest the need for managers to broaden their stakeholder focus when evaluating advertising's returns and to communicate the value of marketing capability to investors.","Guiyang Xiong, Sundar Bharadwaj","advertising, marketing capability, abnormal stock returns, cash flows, investor attention, news",0
Framing Influences Willingness to Pay but Not Willingness to Accept,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0430,01-Dec-13,01-Dec-13,50,6,725,738,"The authors show, with real and hypothetical payoffs, that consumers are willing to pay substantially less for a risky prospect when it is called a “lottery ticket,” “raffle,” “coin flip,” or “gamble” than when it is labeled a “gift certificate” or “voucher.” Willingness to accept, in contrast, is not affected by these frames. This differential framing effect is the result of an aversion to bad deals, which causes buyers to focus on different aspects than sellers. Buyers’ willingness to pay is influenced by the extent to which a risky prospect's frame is associated with risk (Experiment 1) as well as the prospect's lowest (but not highest) possible outcome (Experiment 2). Sellers’ willingness to accept, in contrast, is influenced by a prospect's lowest and highest possible outcomes but not by the risk associated with its frame (Experiments 2 and 3). The framing effect on willingness to pay is independent of the objective level of uncertainty (Experiment 4) and can lead to the uncertainty effect. The findings have important implications for research on risk preferences and marketing practice.","Yang Yang, Joachim Vosgerau, George Loewenstein","framing, willingness to pay, willingness to accept, endowment effect, uncertainty effect",1

In six studies, the authors show that social crowdedness not only leads to greater accessibility of safety-related constructs but also results in greater preference for safety-oriented options (e.g., preferring to visit a pharmacy to a convenience store), being more receptive to prevention- (rather than promotion-) framed messages, and being more risk averse with real money gambles. In support of the authors’ underlying avoidance motivation perspective, these effects are mediated by participants’ net prevention focus and are attenuated when the crowd in question consists of in-group members.

Prominence versus Dominance: How Relationships between Alternatives Drive Decision Strategy and Choice,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.13.0052,01-Dec-13,01-Dec-13,50,6,753,766,"This article argues that the structure of a choice set can influence the extent to which consumers weight a given attribute. The results of seven experiments suggest that the relationship between options under consideration can influence preference ordering by shifting the decision strategy people adopt when constructing their preference. In decisions in which people afford greater importance to one attribute versus another, preference for an option that scores high on this prominent attribute may decrease when decoy options that are clearly better or worse than the focal options are inserted into the choice set. The authors posit that this effect arises because decision makers initially (and spontaneously) use dominance cues rather than prominence when evaluating options, and they continue to use this strategy even when it does not enable them to differentiate the alternatives under consideration. The authors moderate this effect by prompting respondents to consider prominence and by manipulating the order in which respondents evaluate options in the choice set. This article has theoretical implications for research on context effects, contingent decision behavior, and choice architecture as well as practical implications for product-line management.","Ioannis Evangelidis, Jonathan Levav","dominance, prominence, context effects, attribute, number of alternatives",0

Five experiments provide support for this hypothesis across various measures of caloric desire and actual eating behavior. The findings have notable implications for marketing and public policy.

When Does Retargeting Work? Information Specificity in Online Advertising,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0503,01-Oct-13,01-Oct-13,50,5,561,576,"Firms can now offer personalized recommendations to consumers who return to their website, using consumers' previous browsing history on that website. In addition, online advertising has greatly improved in its use of external browsing data to target Internet ads. Dynamic retargeting integrates these two advances by using information from the browsing history on the firm's website to improve advertising content on external websites. When surfing the Internet, consumers who previously viewed products on the firm's website are shown ads with images of those same products. To examine whether this is more effective than simply showing generic brand ads, the authors use data from a field experiment conducted by an online travel firm. Surprisingly, the data suggest that dynamic retargeted ads are, on average, less effective than their generic equivalents. However, when consumers exhibit browsing behavior that suggests their product preferences have evolved (e.g., visiting review websites), dynamic retargeted ads no longer underperform. One explanation for this finding is that when consumers begin a product search, their preferences are initially construed at a high level. As a result, they respond best to higher-level product information. Only when they have narrowly construed preferences do they respond positively to ads that display detailed product information. This finding suggests that in evaluating how best to reach consumers through ads, managers should be aware of the multistage nature of consumers' decision processes and vary advertising content along these stages.","Anja Lambrecht, Catherine Tucker","retargeting, online advertising, field experiments, online decision process, construal level theory",21
Conflict Management and Outcomes in Franchise Relationships: The Role of Regulation,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0144,01-Oct-13,01-Oct-13,50,5,577,589,"Franchise relationships are prone to conflict. To safeguard the rights of individual franchisees, several states have legislated greater franchisor disclosure (registration law) ex ante and/or franchisor “termination for good cause” (relationship law) ex post. The impact of regulatory oversight on franchisor–franchisee conflict, however, remains unclear. Relying on agency theory arguments, the authors first assess the influence of the regulatory context, both by itself and in combination with the franchise ownership structure, on the incidence of litigated conflict. Conditional on litigation, they also predict the impact of franchise regulation on both the parties’ litigation initiation and resolution choices and the resulting outcomes. The authors test the hypotheses using a unique multisource archival database of 411 instances of litigation across 75 franchise systems observed over 17 years. The results indicate that the regulatory context, by itself as well as in combination with the franchise ownership structure, significantly shapes parties’ conflict management choices. The authors also find evidence of a trade-off between prevailing in the particular conflict and achieving franchise system growth objectives.","Kersi D. Antia, Xu (Vivian) Zheng, Gary L.

With rock-bottom prices and minimal assortments, they differ greatly from “large discounters” such as Wal-Mart, constituting complements to, rather than substitutes for, more traditional supermarkets. Therefore, the authors propose that HD impact of entry on local incumbents is different as well. Using a store choice and spending model that explicitly accounts for interstore synergies and multiple-store shopping behavior, the authors study consumer responses to 194 HD openings. Although they find that HDs, like large discounters, especially appeal to private label–prone shoppers and lead to sizable incumbent losses, the results confirm that the nature of these losses is different. First, HDs do not cause incumbent chains to lose their best customers; instead, shoppers who have already visited other chains alongside the incumbent are lost. Second, the authors find that chains located in close proximity to new HDs do not suffer more from their entry. Third, losses are lower for upscale chains and incumbents that strongly complement the HD. The authors conclude by discussing implications for proper response to HD entry.","Mark Vroegrijk, Els Gijsbrechts, Katia Campo","grocery retailing, hard discounters, multiple-store shopping, store entry, competitive response",2
Observer Effects of Punishment in a Distribution Network,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0142,01-Oct-13,01-Oct-13,50,5,627,643,"In a distribution network, a punishment event not only affects the disciplined distributor but also changes the attitudes and behaviors of others in the network (i.e., observers). By moving beyond a dyadic view of punishment, this article considers the effects of punishment on observers and integrates insights from social learning, fairness heuristic, and social network theories. The resulting framework of the observer effects of punishment in a distribution network, empirically tested with a survey in China, reveals two mechanisms through which punishment leads to reduced observer opportunism: (1) a direct deterrence effect and (2) a trust-building process. Moreover, two information-related constructs moderate the observer effects differently. The disciplined distributor's relational embeddedness, which motivates greater information flow to observers, aggravates the problem of information asymmetry against the manufacturer, making punishment less deterrent for observers. In contrast, the manufacturer's monitoring capability, which reduces information asymmetry, strengthens observer effects. The authors discuss both theoretical and managerial implications of using punishment to achieve collaboration from a wide network of channel members.","Danny T. Wang, Flora F.

To address this need, the authors report the results of a large multischool conjoint survey of return-migration preferences among U.S. STEM doctoral students from China. The survey presents the respondents with potential job offers and yields individual-level estimates of each respondent's indirect utility of a job as a function of location, job status, and salary. The authors use a delayed follow-up choice task to demonstrate stability of the preference estimates both over time and across response modalities. The estimated preferences imply that Chinese doctoral graduates tend to remain in the United States because of a large salary disparity between the two countries rather than because of an inherent preference for locating in the United States. Given these estimated preferences, the authors conduct several policy-relevant, counterfactual simulations of return-migration choice and outline effective targeting and positioning strategy for attracting Chinese STEM talent.","Robert Zeithammer, Ryan P.

This study aims to enhance understanding of brand characteristics as antecedents of WOM by executing a comprehensive empirical analysis. For this purpose, the authors constructed a unique data set on online and offline WOM and characteristics for more than 600 of the most talked-about U.S. brands. To guide this empirical analysis, they present a theoretical framework arguing that consumers spread WOM on brands as a result of social, emotional, and functional drivers. Using these drivers, the authors identify a set of 13 brand characteristics that stimulate WOM, including three (level of differentiation, excitement, and complexity) that have not been studied to date as WOM antecedents. The authors find that whereas the social and functional drivers are the most important for online WOM, the emotional driver is the most important for offline WOM. These results provide an insightful perspective on WOM and have meaningful managerial implications for brand management and investment in WOM campaigns.","Mitchell J.

In conjunction with an entrance survey of purchase intentions, they conduct several descriptive analyses that focus on the incidence, category propensity, behavioral characteristics, and outcome of unplanned consideration. The results reveal several new empirical insights. First, the authors find significant category-level complementarities between planned items and unplanned considerations, which they capture using a latent category map. Second, planned consideration and unplanned consideration differ in key behavioral characteristics (e.g., likelihood of purchase, time of occurrence, number of product touches). Third, greater likelihood of purchase conversion is significantly associated with dynamic factors (e.g., remaining in-store slack, outcome of the previous consideration) and behavioral characteristics (e.g., number of displays viewed, distance to shelf, references to a shopping list).

Temporal Contiguity and Negativity Bias in the Impact of Online Word of Mouth,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0063,01-Aug-13,01-Aug-13,50,4,463,476,"Prior research shows that positive online reviews are less valued than negative reviews. The authors argue that this is due to differences in causal attributions for positive versus negative information such that positive reviews tend to be relatively more attributed to the reviewer (vs. product experience) than negative reviews. The presence of temporal contiguity cues, which indicate that review writing closely follows consumption, reduces the relative extent to which positive reviews are attributed to the reviewer and mitigates the negativity bias. An examination of 65,531 Yelp.com restaurant reviews shows that review value is negatively related to review valence but that this negative relationship is absent for reviews that contain temporal contiguity cues. A series of lab studies replicates these findings and suggests that temporal contiguity cues enhance the value of a positive review and increase the likelihood of choosing a product with a positive review by changing reader beliefs about the cause of the review.","Zoey Chen, Nicholas H.

Survey takers who received BTS-based payments without explanation became less likely to recognize foils as they progressed through the survey, suggesting that they learned to respond to BTS incentives despite the absence of guidance.

Specifically, they find that (1) willingness to pursue a risky investment increases when SK is high (vs. low) relative to a prior investment choice (Study 1); (2) willingness to enroll in a retirement saving program is enhanced by asking consumers an easy (vs. difficult) question about finance, thereby increasing SK (Study 2); (3) technically elaborating information about a mutual fund diminishes SK regarding that investment and decreases choice of that fund (Study 3); and (4) consumers invest less money in funds when missing information is made salient, holding the objective investment information constant (Study 4). Furthermore, the effects in Studies 2–4 are mediated by participants’ self-rated SK. The authors propose that effective financial education must focus not only on imparting relevant information and enhancing OK but also on promoting higher levels of SK.","Liat Hadar, Sanjay Sood, Craig R.

Bonuses versus Commissions: A Field Study,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0485,16-Oct-18,01-Jun-13,50,3,317,333,"Quota-based bonuses and commissions are the two most common incentive compensation plans. The authors uncover differential effects of these plans from a natural field-based experiment featuring 14,000 monthly observations over three years from 458 sales territories of a pharmaceutical firm that switched from a bonus plan to an equivalent commission plan. The intervention led to significant sales productivity improvement; this effect was heterogeneous across ability deciles, with much larger increases occurring at lower ability deciles. The authors find significant differences across these plans on (1) effort against nonincentivized tasks and (2) output fluctuations induced through “timing games.” At this firm, the bonus plan was strictly inferior to the implemented commission plan with respect to short-term revenues and timing games. In contrast, the commission plan induced greater neglect of nonincentivized tasks (tasks not directly affecting observable output). To organize their findings, the authors build a simple theoretical model in the personnel economics tradition. The novel result that multitasking concerns are reduced under bonus plans when the quota has been met provides a nuanced rationale for the widespread existence of lump-sum bonus plans.","Sunil Kishore, Raghunath Singh Rao, Om Narasimhan,...","sales compensation, field experiments, timing games, multitasking",3
Judging the Book by Its Cover? how Consumers Decode Conspicuous Consumption Cues in Buyer–Seller Relationships,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0478,01-Jun-13,01-Jun-13,50,3,334,347,"Little empirical consumer research has focused on the decoding of conspicuous symbolism, that is, the inferences consumers make about others’ conspicuous consumption. Grounded in theory on social perception and role congruity, four experiments show that consumer inferences about and behavioral intentions toward conspicuous sellers are moderated by communal and exchange relationship norms. Specifically, conspicuous consumption by a seller decreases warmth inferences and, in turn, behavioral intentions toward the seller under the communal norm; conversely, it increases competence inferences and, in turn, behavioral intentions under the exchange norm. A seller's mere wealth triggers similar inferences, suggesting that conspicuous consumption is a surrogate for actual wealth. Priming consumers with persuasion knowledge inhibits the inferential benefits resulting from conspicuousness under the exchange norm. These findings reveal the theoretically meaningful role of the consumption context by showing that consumers’ warmth and competence inferences operate differentially in commercial relationships as a result of salient communal versus exchange norms, with important consequences for consumers’ behavioral intentions.","Maura L.

Fusing Aggregate and Disaggregate Data with an Application to Multiplatform Media Consumption,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0431,01-Jun-13,01-Jun-13,50,3,348,364,"As firms collect greater amounts of data about their customers from an ever broader set of “touchpoints,” a new set of methodological challenges arises. Companies often collect data from these various platforms at differing levels of aggregation, and it is not clear how to merge these data sources to draw meaningful inferences about customer-level behavior patterns. In this article, the authors provide a method that firms can use, based on readily available data, to gauge and monitor multiplatform media usage. The key innovation in the method is a Bayesian data-fusion approach that enables researchers to combine individual-level usage data (readily available for most digital platforms) with aggregated data on usage over time (typically available for traditional platforms). This method enables the authors to disentangle the intraday correlations between platforms (i.e., the usage of one platform vs. another on a given day) from longer-term correlations across users (i.e., heavy/light usage of multiple platforms over time). The authors conclude with a discussion of how this method can be used in a variety of marketing contexts for which data have become readily available, such as gauging the interplay between online and brick-and-mortar purchasing behavior.","Eleanor McDonnell Feit, Pengyuan Wang, Eric T.

Marketing Channels in Foreign Markets: Control Mechanisms and the Moderating Role of Multinational Corporation Headquarters–Subsidiary Relationship,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0487,01-Jun-13,01-Jun-13,50,3,378,398,"To manage marketing channels, subsidiaries of multinational corporations (MNCs) must balance mandates from headquarters (HQ) with the local realities of the foreign markets.

The authors test the hypotheses using field data from German and Japanese MNCs in the United States and Bayesian models that account for measurement error, endogeneity in the control mechanisms, heterogeneity in country of origin, and nonlinear and interactive terms for the latent constructs.

The Impact of Brand Rating Dispersion on Firm Value,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0188,01-Jun-13,01-Jun-13,50,3,399,415,"This study examines brand dispersion—variance in brand ratings across consumers—and its role in the translation of brand assets into firm value. Dispersion captures the covert heterogeneity in brand evaluations among consumers who like or dislike the brands, which would affect an investor's decision to buy or sell a stock. The higher the dispersion, the more inconsistent and polarized the brands’ cross-consumer ratings. Multiple analyses on 730,818 brand–day observations provide robust evidence that brand dispersion fluctuations affect stock prices. Brand dispersion has Januslike effects: it harms returns but reduces firm risk. Furthermore, downside dispersion has a stronger impact on abnormal returns than upside dispersion, indicating an asymmetry in brand dispersion's effects. Moreover, dispersion tempers the risk-reduction benefits of higher brand rating in both the short run and long run. Without modeling dispersion, brand rating's impact on firm value can be over- or underestimated. Managers should consider dispersion a vital brand-management metric and add it to the brand-performance dashboard.","Xueming Luo, Sascha Raithel, Michael A.

How Variety-Seeking versus Inertial Tendency Influences the Effectiveness of Immediate versus Delayed Promotions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.12.0011,16-Oct-18,01-Jun-13,50,3,416,426,"Four studies investigate (1) whether a variety-seeking versus inertial environment activates a certain mind-set about risk propensity and (2) whether this mind-set influences preferences for immediate versus delayed promotions.

Study 2 reveals that preferences for a brand offering a delayed promotion are stronger when consumers have a variety-seeking tendency and that preferences of consumers low (vs. high) in need for cognitive closure are more influenced by the difference in variety-seeking versus inertial tendency.

Decomposing the Value of Word-of-Mouth Seeding Programs: Acceleration versus Expansion,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0305,01-Apr-13,01-Apr-13,50,2,161,176,"In word-of-mouth seeding programs, customer word of mouth can generate value through market expansion; in other words, it can gain customers who would not otherwise have bought the product. Alternatively, word of mouth can generate value by accelerating the purchases of customers who would have purchased anyway. This article presents the first investigation exploring how acceleration and expansion combine to generate value in a word-of-mouth seeding program for a new product. The authors define a program's “social value” as the global change, over the entire social system, in customer equity that can be attributed to the word-of-mouth program participants. They compute programs’ social value in various scenarios using an agent-based simulation model and empirical connectivity data on 12 social networks in various markets as input to the simulation. The authors show how expansion and acceleration integrate to create programs’ social value and illustrate how the role of each is affected by factors such as competition, program targeting, profit decline, and retention.

Price and Advertising Effectiveness over the Business Cycle,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0414,01-Apr-13,01-Apr-13,50,2,177,193,"Firms are under increasing pressure to justify their marketing expenditures. This evolution toward greater accountability is reinforced in harsh economic times when marketing budgets are among the first to be reconsidered. To make such decisions, managers must know whether, and to what extent, marketing's effectiveness varies with the economic tide; however, surprisingly little research addresses this issue. Therefore, the authors conduct a systematic investigation of the business cycle's impact on the effectiveness of two important marketing instruments: price and advertising. To do so, they estimate time-varying short- and long-term advertising and price elasticities for 150 brands across 36 consumer packaged goods categories, using 18 years of monthly U.K. data from 1993 to 2010. The long-term price sensitivity tends to decrease during economic expansions, whereas long-term advertising elasticities increase. During contractions, the long-term own and cross price elasticities increase. Moreover, throughout the observation period, the short-term price elasticity became significantly stronger. Finally, patterns differ across categories and brands, which presents opportunities for firms that know how to ride the economic tide.","Harald J. Van Heerde, Maarten J. Gijsenberg, Marnik G.

Personal Relevance and Mental Simulation Amplify the Duration Framing Effect,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0172,01-Apr-13,01-Apr-13,50,2,194,206,"Different framing of the same duration (one year, 12 months, 365 days) can influence consumers’ impressions of subjective duration, thereby affecting their judgments and decisions. The authors propose that, ironically, self-relevance amplifies this duration framing effect. Consumers for whom a particular self-improvement domain is personally relevant are less likely to adopt a one-year self-improvement plan as compared with a 12-month plan because they perceive it as longer and more difficult. This bias is more likely to manifest in consumers who report that the task is highly personally relevant to them, who are making predictions for themselves (vs. others), and who have high (vs. low) task involvement. Personal relevance amplifies this effect because it prompts process-focused simulation of the plan, consequently increasing susceptibility to spurious duration and difficulty cues embedded in frames.","GüLden üLküMen, Manoj Thomas","duration framing, personal relevance, process simulation, mental simulation, duration perception",4

In contrast, if the cake already belongs to her, she will perceive it to be smaller if she is hungry than if she is satiated.

In contrast, when rapport is high, this relationship reverses, such that opportunism is actually more likely when the stakes are low than when they are high. The authors attribute these findings to differences in reasoning and find that when rapport is high and the stakes are low, people are better able to justify their actions by employing morally malleable reasoning. Thus, this research offers insights into an important form of opportunism that has been largely absent from transaction cost theory.","Sandy D. Jap, Diana C.

Using point-by-point bid data from two industrial procurement auctions, the authors show that bidders appear to be making inferences about their own implied quality differentials and adjust their bidding strategies and bidding aggression accordingly. Specifically, they find that high-quality bidders tend to be more aggressive in bidding against potentially higher-quality competition and less aggressive when bidding against potentially lower-quality competition. In contrast, low-quality bidders appear aggressive regardless of their implied quality in relation to the competition.

Service innovations are enabled primarily by the Internet or people, corresponding to two types of innovativeness: e- and p-innovativeness.

The results reveal important asymmetries between e- and p-innovativeness. Whereas e-innovativeness has a positive and significant direct effect on firm value, p-innovativeness has an overall significantly positive effect on firm value through its positive effect on customer satisfaction but only in human-dominated industries. Both e- and p-innovativeness are positively associated with idiosyncratic risk, but customer satisfaction partially mediates this relationship for p-innovativeness to lower this risk in human-dominated industries.

This specification yields a novel set of 456 elasticities across categories and time that are generated using the same method and therefore can be directly compared. On average, price sensitivity is countercyclical: It rises when the macroeconomy weakens. However, substantial variation exists, and a handful of categories exhibit procyclical price sensitivity. The authors show that the relationship between price sensitivity and macroeconomic growth correlates strongly with the average level of price sensitivity in a category. They examine several explanations for this result and conclude that a category's share of wallet is the more likely driver versus alternative explanations based on product perishability, substitution across consumption channels, or market power.","Brett R.

The authors demonstrate that expertise contributes to the perceived benefits of an activity, which in turn leads to high value associated with it. Expertise also directly influences value obtained from an activity. This expertise, in turn, is acquired over time through past consumption.

The authors show that this shift in preferences is due to a change in elaboration from having features to using features, and they identify three key moderators to the effect: need for cognition, feature trivialness, and materialism. Finally, the authors investigate the downstream consequences of usage estimation on product satisfaction, demonstrating that consumers who estimate usage before choice experience greater product satisfaction and are more likely to recommend their chosen product.

Identifying such causal effects is challenging due to several alternative confounds that generate correlation in agents' actions. In the absence of experimental variation, a preferred solution has been to control for these spurious correlations using a rich specification of fixed effects. The authors show that fixed-effects estimators of this sort are inconsistent in the presence of installed-base effects; in simulations, random-effects specifications perform even worse. The analysis reveals the tension the applied empiricist faces in this area: a rich control for unobservables increases the credibility of the reported causal effects, but the incorporation of these controls introduces biases of a new kind in this class of models. The authors present two solutions: a modified version of an instrumental variable approach and a new bias-correction approach, both of which deliver consistent estimates of causal installed-base effects. The empirical application to the adoption of the Toyota Prius Hybrid in California shows evidence for social influence in diffusion and reveals that implementing the bias correction reverses the sign of the measured installed-base effect.

Repositioning Dynamics and Pricing Strategy,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0068,01-Dec-12,01-Dec-12,49,6,750,772,"The authors measure the revenue and cost implications to supermarkets of changing their price positioning strategy in oligopolistic downstream retail markets. Their approach formally incorporates the dynamics induced by the repositioning in a model with strategic interaction. They exploit a unique data set containing the price format decisions of all U.S. supermarkets in the 1990s. The data contain the format change decisions of supermarkets in response to a large shock to their local market positions: the entry of Wal-Mart. The authors exploit the responses of retailers to Wal-Mart entry to infer the cost of changing pricing formats using a revealed-preference argument. The interaction between retailers and Wal-Mart in each market is modeled as a dynamic game. The authors find evidence that entry by Wal-Mart had a significant impact on the costs and incidence of switching pricing strategy. Their results add to the marketing literature on the organization of retail markets and have implications for long-term market structure in the supermarket industry. Their approach, which incorporates long-term dynamic consequences, strategic interaction, and sunk investment costs, may be used to empirically model firms’ positioning decisions in marketing more generally.","Paul B.

"Advertising and Consumer Awareness of New, Differentiated Products",https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0045,01-Dec-12,01-Dec-12,49,6,773,792,"This article proposes a novel approach to assess the dynamic effect that advertising expenditures have on which products consumers include in their choice sets. In a discrete-choice model, consumers face choice sets that evolve according to their awareness of each product. Advertising expenditures have a dynamic effect in the sense that they raise consumer awareness of a product, increasing present and future sales. To estimate this effect, the authors explicitly model the firms’ dynamic advertising decisions and illustrate the model using data from the Spanish automobile market. The results show that the effect of advertising on awareness is dynamic and that accounting for it is crucial in explaining the evolution of product sales over its life cycle. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that the awareness process can be significantly sped up by advertising. Thus, there is a great heterogeneity in the length of the awareness process among products, depending on the level of advertising expenditures; it may range from one to six years.","Alicia Barroso, Gerard Llobet","advertising, discrete choice models, consumer choice set, awareness process, new products",0
Discovering how Advertising Grows Sales and Builds Brands,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0060,01-Dec-12,01-Dec-12,49,6,793,806,"Advertising nudges consumers along the think–feel–do hierarchy of intermediate effects of advertising to induce sales. Because intermediate effects—cognition, affect, and experience—are unobservable constructs, brand managers use a battery of mind-set metrics to assess how advertising builds brands. However, extant sales response models explain how advertising grows sales but ignore the role of intermediate effects in building brands. To link these dual contributions of advertising, the authors propose an integrated framework that augments the dynamic advertising–sales response model by integrating the hierarchy, dynamic evolution, and purchase reinforcement of intermediate effects. Methodologically, the new approach incorporates the intermediate effects as factors from mind-set metrics while filtering out measurement noise, extracts the factor loadings, estimates the dynamic evolution of the factors, and infers their sequence in any hypothesized hierarchy by embedding their impact in a dynamic advertising–sales response model. The authors apply the proposed model and associated method to a major brand to discover the brand's operating hierarchy (advertising → experience → cognition → affect ↔ sales). The results provide the first empirical evidence that intermediate effects are indeed dynamic constructs, that purchase reinforcement effects exist not only for experience but also for other intermediate effects, and that advertising simultaneously contributes to both sales growth and brand building. Thus, both researchers and managers should consider using the proposed framework to capture advertising's dual contributions of building brands and growing sales.","Norris I.

New Drug Diffusion when Forward-Looking Physicians Learn from Patient Feedback and Detailing,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0114,01-Dec-12,01-Dec-12,49,6,807,821,"The authors study physicians’ prescription choices when uncertainty about drug efficacy is resolved through two channels: firms’ marketing activities (e.g., detailing) and patients’ experiences with the drugs. They first provide empirical evidence that suggests that the well-understood information incentive for physicians to experiment with new drugs is reduced when physicians anticipate future detailing. Therefore, increased detailing activity triggers opposing forces: Adoption is hastened as physicians become informed (assuming prior knowledge is initially low) and slows as they reduce experimentation and instead obtain information from detailing at no cost. The authors then estimate a dynamic Bayesian learning model that embodies these trade-offs using physician-level data on prescription choices and detailing received in the months surrounding the introduction of two erectile dysfunction drugs, Levitra and Cialis. Detailing elasticities are lower when physicians anticipate changes in detailing activity than when such changes are unexpected. Accordingly, the authors conclude that to maximize the effect of detailing, firms should avoid announcing increases in detailing activities.","Pradeep K. Chintagunta, Ronald L.

Determining Consumers’ Discount Rates with Field Studies,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0009,01-Dec-12,01-Dec-12,49,6,822,841,"Because utility/profits, state transitions, and discount rates are confounded in dynamic models, discount rates are typically fixed for the purpose of identification. The authors propose a strategy of identifying discount rates. The identification rests on imputing the utility/profits using decisions made in a context in which the future is inconsequential, the objective function is concave, and the decision space is continuous. They then use these utilities/profits to identify discount rates in contexts in which dynamics become material. The authors exemplify this strategy using a field study in which cell phone users transitioned from a linear to a three-part-tariff pricing plan. They find that the estimated discount rate corresponds to a weekly discount factor (.90), lower than the value typically assumed in empirical research (.995). When using a standard .995 discount factor, they find that the price coefficient is underestimated by 16%. Moreover, the predicted intertemporal substitution pattern and demand elasticities are biased, leading to a 29% deterioration in model fit and suboptimal pricing recommendations that would lower potential revenue gains by 76%.","Song Yao, Carl F.

Factor loadings are associated with a brand's position along a satiation dimension, and factor scores are associated with a household's sensitivity to satiation effects. The authors introduce dynamics by allowing the factor scores to evolve over time, reflecting variation in household satiation sensitivity. They embed the factor model in a direct utility model that allows for both corner and interior solutions and show that it fits the data better than alternative specifications. Analysis of a panel data set of corn chips purchases indicates that respondent satiation is better explained by a low-dimensional factor structure, while baseline utility and preferences are not.

While functional and economic concerns are important, the authors examine whether visual influence also plays a role. Using a hierarchical Bayesian probability model and data on 1.6 million new cars sold over nine years, they examine how visual influence affects purchase volume, focusing on three questions: Are people more likely to buy a new car if others around them have recently done so? Are these effects moderated by visibility, the ease of seeing others’ behavior? Do they vary according to the identity (e.g., gender) of prior purchasers and the identity relevance of vehicle type? The authors perform an extensive set of tests to rule out alternatives to visual influence and find that visual effects are (1) present (one additional purchase for approximately every seven prior purchases), (2) larger in areas where others’ behavior should be more visible (i.e., more people commute in car-visible ways), (3) stronger for prior purchases by men than by women in male-oriented vehicle types, (4) extant only for cars of similar price tiers, and (5) subject to saturation effects.","Blakeley B.

When Guilt Begets Pleasure: The Positive Effect of a Negative Emotion,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.09.0421,01-Dec-12,01-Dec-12,49,6,872,881,"Understanding how emotions can affect pleasure has important implications both for people and for firms’ communication strategies. Prior research has shown that experienced pleasure often assimilates to the valence of one's active emotions, such that negative emotions decrease pleasure. In contrast, the authors demonstrate that the activation of guilt, a negative emotion, enhances the pleasure experienced from hedonic consumption. The authors show that this effect occurs because of a cognitive association between guilt and pleasure, such that activating guilt can automatically activate cognitions related to pleasure. Furthermore, the authors show that this pattern of results is unique to guilt and cannot be explained by a contrast effect that generalizes to other negative emotions. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for marketing and consumption behavior.","Kelly Goldsmith, Eunice Kim Cho, Ravi Dhar","emotion, hedonic consumption, guilt, pleasure",15
When Talk is “Free”: The Effect of Tariff Structure on Usage under Two- and Three-Part Tariffs,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0444,18-Oct-18,01-Dec-12,49,6,882,899,"In many service industries, firms introduce three-part tariffs to replace or complement existing two-part tariffs. In contrast with two-part tariffs, three-part tariffs offer allowances, or “free” units of the service. Behavioral research suggests that the attributes of a pricing plan may affect behavior beyond their direct cost implications. Evidence suggests that customers value free units above and beyond what might be expected from the change in their budget constraint. Nonlinear pricing research, however, has not considered such an effect. The authors examine a market in which three-part tariffs were introduced for the first time. They analyze tariff choice and usage behavior for customers who switch from two-part to three-part tariffs. The findings show that switchers significantly “overuse” in comparison with their prior two-part tariff usage. That is, they attain a level of consumption that cannot be explained by a shift in the budget constraint. The authors estimate a discrete/continuous model of tariff choice and usage that accounts for the valuation of free units. The results show that the majority of three-part-tariff users value minutes under a three-part tariff more than they do under a two-part tariff.

The Best of Both Worlds?

This article proposes a generalized theory of healthful indulgences, identifying when and why people overconsume versus regulate food intake in response to health claims. Four studies demonstrate that not all health claims are created equal. The authors suggest that the nature of the food attributes the claims emphasize—namely, functional versus hedonic—determines the extent of consumption of the indulgence. Health claims featuring functional attributes (e.g., “extra antioxidants”) trigger high levels of health-goal accessibility, which, together with simultaneously accessible indulgence goals attached to the indulgence, results in goal conflict. This conflict leads to reduced consumption of the food. In contrast, health claims featuring hedonic attributes (e.g., “low fat”) render health goals less accessible while accentuating the pleasure dimension of the food, resulting in lower goal conflict and increased consumption of the food. Implications for the food industry and public policy makers are discussed.","Nina Belei, Kelly Geyskens, Caroline Goukens,...","health claims, goal conflict, self-control, consumption",3
Willingness to Pay for Cause-Related Marketing: The Impact of Donation Amount and Moderating Effects,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0511,01-Dec-12,01-Dec-12,49,6,910,927,"Companies increasingly employ cause-related marketing to enhance customer goodwill and improve their image.

Study 1 confirms that two types of customer predispositions moderate the link between donation amount and willingness to pay: donation-related and cause-related predispositions. Three additional studies focus on the negative moderating effect of company–cause fit and provide insights into the underlying moderation process. Specifically, the motives customers attribute to the company mediate the moderating impact of fit on the donation amount–WTP link (Study 2), which occurs particularly in cases of utilitarian (Study 3) and privately consumed products (Study 4).","Nicole Koschate-Fischer, Isabel V.

Guilt appeals are more effective when paired with gain frames, whereas shame appeals are more effective when paired with loss frames. These framing effects occur because gain frames facilitate the use of problem-focused coping strategies favored by guilt, whereas loss frames facilitate the use of emotion-focused coping strategies favored by shame. Frames that fit with the emotion facilitate the activation of coping strategies consistent with that emotion and consequently lead to greater fluency and message effectiveness.

How Attribute Quantity Influences Option Choice,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0142,01-Dec-12,01-Dec-12,49,6,942,953,"Products can be described by different numbers of attributes, but can the mere number of attributes presented across a choice set influence what type of options people choose? This article demonstrates that attribute numerosity tends to benefit certain types of options more than others and consequently has systematic effects on choice. Because attributes often serve as a heuristic cue for product usefulness, they benefit options that people perceive as relatively inferior on this dimension. Consistent with this perspective, five studies demonstrate that attribute numerosity benefits hedonic more than utilitarian options by increasing the extent to which the former appear useful. Consequently, increasing attribute quantity equally across the choice set shifts choice toward hedonic options, regardless of whether the attributes are hedonic, utilitarian, or mixed in nature. Consistent with this conceptualization, these effects become amplified when decision makers engage in heuristic processing and when priming makes usefulness salient. The findings have important implications for how marketers present attribute information, for public policy and consumer welfare, and for understanding argument numerosity effects in persuasion more broadly.","Aner Sela, Jonah Berger","attributes, numerosity, hedonic and utilitarian choice, attitudes, conjoint analysis",0

As a spectator (e.g., watching a game), independents’ (vs. interdependents') experience consumption evaluations are more likely to be influenced by outcome, while interdependent (vs. independent) consumers are more likely to be affected by process. The reverse is true when consumers assume the role of a participant in the experience (e.g., playing a game).

More than Fit: Brand Extension Authenticity,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0015,18-Oct-18,01-Dec-12,49,6,967,983,"This article introduces a new determinant of brand extension success, brand extension authenticity (BEA), as a complement to fit.

They demonstrate the power of BEA in predicting consumer reactions to brand extensions, particularly among consumers with strong self–brand connections. Not only is BEA distinct from two conceptualizations of fit in brand extension literature—fit as similarity and fit as relevance—but it also moderates the effects of both fit dimensions on brand extension responses. By capturing a cultural and consumer relational perspective that shapes reactions to brand extensions, BEA provides an important, complementary construct for predicting brand extension success and enhancing brand value. Brand managers attentive to BEA may be able to stretch brands further than assessments of fit alone would suggest, but they risk failure in otherwise well-fitting extensions perceived as inauthentic.","Susan Spiggle, Hang T.

Study 2 implicates resource depletion as the underlying process; warm temperatures lower cognitive performance for nondepleted people but do not affect the performance of depleted people. Study 3 illustrates the moderating role of task complexity to show that warm temperatures are depleting and decrease willingness to make a difficult product choice.

The tendency to experience these responses is captured in a new scale, the Response-to-Failure scale, which the authors develop and test in three consumer domains: eating, spending, and cheating. The results support the use of the same emotional and cognitive factors to predict post-failure behavior across these three domains, providing evidence of the generalizability of the scale structure.

Explicitly modeling consumer value of status products as coming from the information the product ownership conveys to other consumers, the authors show that a status-product manufacturer can benefit from a competitor's cost reduction because of the competitor's price reduction associated with it. In other words, they show that two status products that are (imperfect) substitutes in the consumer utility function may be complements in the profit function. As a consequence, competition could lead to higher prices than the optimal ones under monopoly ownership of both products. The authors confirm the assumptions that consumer value of a status good depends positively on the proportion of desirable type among owners and negatively on the proportion of the desirable type among nonowners in one experiment.

A company's transactional database can only be built from customers' transactions with that company. Any transactions that have been made with other companies are missing. The authors present a modeling approach designed to solve the incomplete information problem. They use transactions conducted with a single supplier in that category to infer consumers' behavior with other suppliers in that category. In particular, armed with prior knowledge of the parametric form of consumer interpurchase time distributions, they uncover elements of the stochastic process that dictates which supplier a consumer chooses on a particular purchase occasion. The authors focus on interpurchase times because they form the core of the incomplete information problem. If a company uses its observed interpurchase times to estimate interpurchase times in the category for a specific consumer, its estimate will be biased upward. Combined with the model developed in this study, a familiar analysis of transaction profitability can be used to build a new type of lifetime value: lifetime category value of the customer.","Yuxin Chen, Joel H.

In this research, the authors examine the influence of price order on consumer choice across differing brands in contexts in which consumer quality perceptions are free to covary with price and they are manipulated to be correlated or uncorrelated with price. Using reference dependence theory as a framework, they find that when differing brand options are presented in descending price order, consumers tend to choose higher-price options; when they are presented in ascending price order, consumers tend to choose lower-priced options (the price order effect).

Misresponse to Reversed and Negated Items in Surveys: A Review,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0368,01-Oct-12,01-Oct-12,49,5,737,747,"There are important advantages to including reversed items in questionnaires (e.g., control of acquiescence, disruption of nonsubstantive responding, better coverage of the domain of content of a construct), but reversed items can also lead to measurement problems (e.g., low measure reliability, complex factor structures).

"A Multicategory Model of Consumers' Purchase Incidence, Quantity, and Brand Choice Decisions: Methodological Issues and Implications on Promotional Decisions",https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0118,01-Aug-12,01-Aug-12,49,4,435,451,"The authors propose a multicategory model of consumers' purchase incidence, quantity, and brand choice decisions. The model specification allows for cross-category promotion effects in both components of the primary demand (incidence and quantity decisions) and uses a flexible functional form of consumer's utility to accurately measure those cross-category effects. To demonstrate the importance of the methodology, the authors investigate two issues of relevance to retailers, namely, how retailers should (1) allocate promotional expenditures across brands in a category and (2) coordinate timing of promotions of brands across categories. The authors estimate the proposed model using consumers' purchases in pasta sauce and pasta categories. The results reveal that using restrictive functional forms of utilities or ignoring cross-category effects in incidence and quantity decisions leads to incorrect assessments on relative allocation of promotional expenditures across brands. Furthermore, retailers are better off contemporaneously promoting brands across the two categories than promoting them in different periods, and ignoring cross-category effects in quantity decisions leads to the opposite inference, namely, that retailers are better off promoting brands across the two categories in different periods.","Nitin Mehta, Yu Ma","multicategory brand choice decisions, purchase incidence decisions, quantity decisions, basket utility maximization, choice models",3
The Quest for Content: How User-Generated Links can Facilitate Online Exploration,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.11.0091,01-Aug-12,01-Aug-12,49,4,452,468,"Online content and products are presented as product networks, in which nodes are product pages linked by hyperlinks.

Recently, websites have begun to offer social networks and user-generated links alongside the product network, creating a dual-network structure. The authors investigate the role of this dual-network structure in facilitating content exploration. They analyze YouTube's dual network and show that user pages have unique structural properties and act as content brokers. Next, the authors show that random rewiring of the product network cannot replicate this brokering effect. They present seven Internet studies in which participants browsing a YouTube-based website are exposed to different conditions of recommendations. The first set of studies shows that exposure to the dual network results in a more efficient (time to desirable outcome) and more effective (average product rating, overall satisfaction) exploration process.

Dynamic Effectiveness of Advertising and Word of Mouth in Sequential Distribution of New Products,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.07.0441,01-Aug-12,01-Aug-12,49,4,469,486,"Firms in many industries release new products in sequential stages. They also launch separate advertising campaigns at each distribution stage. Thus, communication mix elements—advertising and word of mouth (WOM)—can play important, distinct, and yet interdependent roles in stimulating new product demand. Their effectiveness may fluctuate within and across stages and spill over from earlier to later stages. Thus, the authors construct a dynamic linear model to study the dynamic effects of advertising and WOM on demand for heterogeneous products across stages. They further apply the model to examine a canonical example, the theater-then-video sequential distribution of motion pictures, and estimate the parameters using Kalman filtering/smoothing and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. The results show that advertising and WOM exert dynamic, yet diverse, influences on demand for new products. For example, while increased ad spending is more effective at an earlier stage due to repetition wear-in and synergy with WOM, increased WOM activities at a later stage could become more powerful in driving demand. Subsequent optimization exercises suggest that films of varied characteristics can potentially re-allocate their advertising budgets and reap additional revenues.","Norris I.

Can Small Victories Help Win the War?

In particular, should people begin by attempting relatively easy tasks or more difficult ones? How might these differing strategies affect the likelihood of completing the overarching goal? The authors examine this question in the context of an important goal for a large number of consumers—getting out of debt. Using a data set obtained from a debt settlement firm, they find that (1) closing debt accounts is predictive of debt elimination regardless of the dollar balance of the closed accounts, whereas (2) the dollar balance of closed accounts is not predictive of debt elimination when controlling for the fraction of accounts closed.

The authors study the effects of OOS on consumer stockkeeping unit (SKU) preference and price sensitivity, using a unique data set from multiple consumer packaged goods categories with information on recurring OOS incidents. They obtain several substantive findings: (1) Consumers' price sensitivity tends to be underestimated when OOS is not accounted for in a discrete choice model; (2) for consumers who have shorter interpurchase time, their preference for a SKU is attenuated when it is frequently OOS; and (3) for consumers who purchase from a small number of SKUs, their preference for a SKU is reinforced when facing OOS of other similar SKUs, whereas it is attenuated when facing OOS of other similar and also frequently purchased SKUs. The authors also illustrate that their findings can help retailers evaluate the effect of OOS on category revenue and predict time-varying market shares of SKUs in periods following OOS incidents.","Hai Che, Xinlei (Jack) Chen, Yuxin Chen","out-of-stock, SKU preference, price sensitivity, category management, retailing",0
Quantitative Trendspotting,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0167,01-Aug-12,01-Aug-12,49,4,514,536,"Trendspotting has become an important marketing intelligence tool for identifying and tracking general tendencies in consumer interest and behavior. Currently, trendspotting is done either qualitatively by trend hunters, who comb through everyday life in search of signs indicating major shifts in consumer needs and wants, or quantitatively by analysts, who monitor individual indicators, such as how many times a keyword has been searched, blogged, or tweeted online. In this study, the authors demonstrate how the latter can be improved by uncovering common trajectories hidden behind the coevolution of a large array of indicators. The authors propose a structural dynamic factor-analytic model that can be applied for simultaneously analyzing tens or even hundreds of time series, distilling them into a few key latent dynamic factors that isolate seasonal cyclic movements from nonseasonal, nonstationary trend lines. The authors demonstrate this novel multivariate approach to quantitative trendspotting in one application involving a promising new source of marketing intelligence—online keyword search data from Google Insights for Search—in which they analyze search volume patterns across 38 major makes of light vehicles over an 81-month period to uncover key common trends in consumer vehicle shopping interest.","Rex Yuxing Du, Wagner A.

Investing for Retirement: The Moderating Effect of Fund Assortment Size on the 1/N Heuristic,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.08.0355,01-Aug-12,01-Aug-12,49,4,537,550,"Does the number of funds offered in a defined contribution plan affect how many funds consumers choose to invest in or how they spread dollars across the funds they choose? Across three experiments and the analysis of defined contribution plan data, the authors explore these issues by examining investors' tendency to engage in the 1/n heuristic— that is, allocating their dollars evenly across all available investment options. The authors decompose this heuristic into its two underlying behavioral dimensions: the tendency to invest in all available funds (which they label “1/n#”) and the tendency to spread the invested dollars evenly across chosen funds (which they label “1/n$”). The authors argue that choosing from larger fund assortments taxes investors' cognitive resources, which leads to more simplified diversification strategies. They find that increasing the fund assortment size decreases the tendency to invest in all available funds (1/n#) but increases the tendency to spread the invested dollars evenly among the chosen alternatives (1/n$), provided that the number of funds chosen for investment allows for easy equal dollar allocations. The authors integrate their results with prior research regarding asset choice and allocation heuristics.","Maureen Morrin, J. Jeffrey Inman, Susan M.

The present research offers a theoretical perspective that provides a means to resolve these seemingly contradictory findings. Specifically, the authors compare the generation of WOM (i.e., consumers sharing information about their own experiences) with the transmission of WOM (i.e., consumers passing on information about experiences they heard occurred to others). They suggest that a basic human motive to self-enhance leads consumers to generate positive WOM (i.e., share information about their own positive consumption experiences) but transmit negative WOM (i.e., pass on information they heard about others' negative consumption experiences).

Implementing Changes in Marketing Strategy: The Role of Perceived Outcome-and Process-Oriented Supervisory Actions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.07.0466,01-Aug-12,01-Aug-12,49,4,564,580,"This study investigates the role of supervisors in implementing changes in marketing strategy. The authors propose that perceptions of outcome-oriented supervisory actions influence salespeople's primary appraisals of a strategic change (i.e., whether the change will affect them) and that perceptions of process-oriented supervisory actions influence salespeople's secondary appraisals (i.e., whether they can cope with the impact of the change on them). The results from a study of 828 salespeople in 204 branches of a large distributor of industrial goods provide evidence that perceived outcome risk containment and outcome reward emphasis enhance primary appraisals, whereas perceived process risk containment and process reward emphasis enhance secondary appraisals. In turn, the authors find that salespeople's primary and secondary appraisals influence their change implementation behaviors, leading to successful change implementation. Notably, they also find that (outcome and process) risk containment has a greater influence on appraisals of salespeople with a higher performance orientation, but the effects of (outcome and process) reward emphases are invariant across salespeople's performance orientation. The findings suggest that successful implementation of strategic change may depend not merely or even primarily on giving rewards to salespeople for implementing change but also on limiting salespeople's risks and recognizing them for their change-related efforts.","Shikhar Sarin, Goutam Challagalla, Ajay K.

The Influence of Mating Mind-Sets on Brand Extension Evaluation,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.09.0515,01-Aug-12,01-Aug-12,49,4,581,593,"Prior research has identified several factors that influence brand extension evaluations. Extending this research, the authors suggest that external, situational factors can have an important influence on brand extension evaluations. This research focuses on mating mind-sets (i.e., thinking about a mate), which consumers commonly experience. Specifically, the authors propose that mating mind-sets triggered by the external situation can influence brand extension evaluations, particularly for men. Mating mind-sets induce male consumers (but not female consumers) to engage in relational processing, increasing fit perceptions and evaluations for moderately dissimilar brand extensions. These differences are more likely to emerge when a short-term mating mind-set is primed (vs. a long-term mating mind-set). Furthermore, using prestige brands (vs. functional brands) reduces the gap between men and women. In addition, subbrand architecture (vs. direct brand architecture) boosts the evaluations of female consumers but decreases those of male consumers. The authors find that the effects of mating mind-sets on brand extension evaluation are driven by male consumers' need to express creativity.","Alokparna Basu Monga, Zeynep Gürhan-Canli","brand extensions, mating, mind-set, gender, creativity",0

Two studies test these hypotheses. The first study is a meta-analysis of triangulation applications. Using data from 127 studies published in six major marketing and management journals, the authors identify antecedents to key informant reliability. The second study, using eight multi-informant data sets, analyzes antecedents to key informant validity. The results from these studies inform survey researchers as to which conditions particularly call for the use of triangulation.

A General Consumer Preference Model for Experience Products: Application to Internet Recommendation Services,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.09.0467,01-Jun-12,01-Jun-12,49,3,289,305,"The authors present a general consumer preference model for experience products that overcomes the limitations of consumer choice models, especially when it is not easy to consider some qualitative attributes of a product or when there are too many attributes relative to the available amount of preference data, by capturing the effects of unobserved product attributes with the residuals of reference consumers for the same product. They decompose the deterministic component of product utility into two parts: that accounted for by observed attributes and that due to nonobserved attributes. The authors estimate the unobserved component by relating it to the corresponding residuals of virtual experts representing homogeneous groups of people who experienced the product earlier and evaluated it. Their methodology involves identifying such virtual experts and determining the relative importance they should be given in the estimation of the target person's residuals. Using Bayesian estimation methods and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation inference, the authors apply their approach to two types of consumer preference data: (1) online consumer ratings (stated preferences) data for Internet recommendation services and (2) offline consumer viewership (revealed preferences) data for movies. The results empirically show that this new approach outperforms several alternative collaborative filtering and attribute-based preference models with both in- and out-of-sample fits. The model is applicable to both Internet recommendation services and consumer choice studies.","Jaihak Chung, Vithala R.

A Latent Instrumental Variables Approach to Modeling Keyword Conversion in Paid Search Advertising,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0354,01-Jun-12,01-Jun-12,49,3,306,319,"The authors present a modeling approach to assess the purchase conversion performance of individual keywords in paid search advertising. The model facilitates estimation of daily keyword conversion and click-through rates in a sparse data environment while accounting for the endogenous position of the text advertisement served in response to a search. Position endogeneity in paid search data can arise from both omitted variables and measurement error. The authors propose a latent instrumental variable approach to address this problem. They estimate their model on keyword-level paid search data containing daily information on impressions, clicks, and reservations for a major lodging chain. They find that higher positions increase both the click-through and conversion rates. When advertisements are served in higher positions, approximately one-third of new conversions is due to increased click-through while approximately two-thirds are due to increased conversion rates. The authors show that the keyword list generated on the basis of their estimated conversion rates outperforms the status quo list as well as lists generated by observed conversion and click-through rates.","Oliver J.

All Things Considered? the Role of Choice Set Formation in Diversification,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0437,01-Jun-12,01-Jun-12,49,3,320,335,"The diversification effect, a tendency toward greater variety as multiple choices are made simultaneously, in advance of consumption, is a robust and important phenomenon. Researchers have typically explained the diversification effect in terms of differences in the process by which people select items from among those available. This precludes the possibility that the locus of the effect lies in people's choice sets themselves—that is, how people decide which options to consider when making choices. The authors examine the effects of set formation using an experimental choice sequence task and conjoined stochastic model of set formation and conditional choice. The findings demonstrate that set formation plays a critical role in diversification: Previously chosen options are indeed discounted, but only for simultaneous choices and only in the set formation portion of the model. Furthermore, the expected number of choice set items is substantially greater in multiple- versus single- item choice. Specifically, when consumers choose simultaneously choice set sizes appear relatively larger overall, but the previously chosen item is less likely to be in a person's (latent) choice set. These findings cannot be attributed to alternative patterns of covariation, including latent error correlations; to temporal stochastic inflation; or to unobserved heterogeneity.","Linda Court Salisbury, Fred M.

Base-Rate Information in Consumer Attributions of Product-Harm Crises,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0197,01-Jun-12,01-Jun-12,49,3,336,348,"Consumers spontaneously construct attributions for negative events such as product-harm crises. Base-rate information influences these attributions. The research findings suggest that for brands with positive prior beliefs, a high (vs. low) base rate of product-harm crises leads to less blame if the crisis is said to be similar to others in the industry (referred to as the “discounting effect”). However, in the absence of similarity information, a low (vs. high) base rate of crises leads to less blame toward the brand (referred to as the “subtyping effect”). For brands with negative prior beliefs, the extent of blame attributed to the brand is unaffected by the base-rate and similarity information. Importantly, the same base-rate information may have a different effect on the attribution of a subsequent crisis depending on whether discounting or subtyping occurred in the attribution of the first crisis. Consumers who discount a first crisis also tend to discount a second crisis for the same brand, whereas consumers who subtype a first crisis are unlikely to subtype again.","Jing Lei, Niraj Dawar, Zeynep Gürhan-Canli","base-rate information, consumer attributions, product-harm crises",0

Although a firm's profits might be expected to decrease when a competitor expands its product line because the firm loses some sales to the new product, this intuition is incomplete because a competitor's product line expansion can also soften price competition. The author first provides an example using the Hotelling model that demonstrates the possibility and mechanism of profit-increasing competitor entry. He then presents conditions under which a competitor's product line expansion increases profits under the mixed-logit model. The study demonstrates that firms benefit from a rival's entry most when a moderate number of customers are unserved before the new-product introduction and when the new product is positioned such that both the rivals' products appeal to similar sets of customers. With regard to extensions, this study demonstrates that the result continues to hold when firms choose product attributes endogenously and that a manufacturer's profits can increase from a rival's product line expansion even when the firms sell through a retailer.",Raphael Thomadsen,"pricing, competition, product line, product differentiation, new product introduction",0

The functional magnetic resonance imaging data, combined with an additional behavioral study, offer evidence of two noteworthy results.

The Effects of Brand Name Structure on Brand Extension Evaluations and Parent Brand Dilution,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.07.0418,01-Jun-12,01-Jun-12,49,3,373,382,"Three laboratory experiments explore how alternative brand name structures (i.e., family branded or subbranded) and varying degrees of category similarity (i.e., similar or dissimilar) influence extension evaluations and parent brand dilution. The results indicate that subbranded extensions (e.g., Quencher by Tropicana cola) evoke a slower, more thoughtful subtyping processing strategy than family branded extensions (e.g., Tropicana cola), which evoke a faster, category-based processing strategy. As a result, category similarity affects extension evaluations when the extension is family branded but not when it is subbranded. In addition, dilution effects are only evident when consumers have a negative experience with a similar family branded extension. Subbranding thus offers two key benefits to marketers: It both enhances extension evaluations and protects the parent brand from any unwanted negative feedback.","Sanjay Sood, Kevin Lane Keller","brand naming, brand dilution, subbranding, categorization, product experience",1

In this article, the author assesses when and to what extent new products change NBs' market position. To address this question, more than 300 NB and PL introductions are analyzed using a multibreak model that quantifies the impact of product introductions on own share, rival NB and PL share, and category sales. Drawing on empirical generalizations, the author finds that products introduced by leading NBs, standard PLs, and premium PLs are more likely to increase category sales than products introduced by follower NBs or economy PLs. New products introduced by leader and follower NBs more often boost own share. Thus, new products help prevent the decline of NB shares. With respect to competitive impact, new products affect rival shares, with the exception of those launched by economy PLs. Still, NBs tend to hurt rival NBs more often than PLs, and only the leading NB is likely to steal share from all three PL tiers. Moreover, standard PLs tend to be harmed less often by rival new products, unless introduced by the leading NB. Overall, PLs are more likely to be affected by a NB that maintains a large price gap and offers new products with new intrinsic or usage benefits. To fight economy PLs successfully, however, NBs must maintain a smaller price gap, while offering products that focus less on intrinsic and usage benefits.",Katrijn Gielens,"private labels, national brands, retailing, competition, new products, empirical generalizations",0

They assessed concentration of attention through eye tracking and viewer retention by recording zapping behavior. This allows tests of predictions about the interplay of these emotions and interperson attention differences at each point in time during exposure. Surprise and joy effectively concentrate attention and retain viewers. However, importantly, the level rather than the velocity of surprise affects attention concentration most, whereas the velocity rather than the level of joy affects viewer retention most. The effect of joy is asymmetric, with higher gains for increases than losses for decreases. Using these findings, the authors develop representative emotion trajectories to support ad design and testing.","Thales Teixeira, Michel Wedel, Rik Pieters","Internet video avoidance, emotions, attention, eye tracking, facial expressions, simultaneous dynamic model, frailty model",3
The Impact of Relative Standards on the Propensity to Disclose,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.09.0215,01-Apr-12,01-Apr-12,49,2,160,174,"Two sets of studies illustrate the comparative nature of disclosure behavior. The first set investigates how divulgence is affected by signals about others' readiness to divulge and shows a “herding” effect: Survey respondents are more willing to divulge sensitive information when told that previous respondents have made sensitive disclosures (Study 1a). The authors provide evidence of the process underlying this effect and rule out alternative explanations by showing that information on others' propensity to disclose affects respondents' discomfort associated with divulgence (Study 1b) but not their interpretation of the questions (Study 1c). The second set of studies investigates how divulgence is affected by the order in which inquiries of varying intrusiveness are made and suggests that divulgence is anchored by the initial questions in a survey. People are particularly likely to divulge when questions are presented in decreasing order of intrusiveness and less likely when questions are presented in increasing order (Study 2a). The authors show that the effect arises by affecting people's judgments of the intrusiveness of the inquiries (Study 2b). The effect is altered when, at the outset of the study, privacy concerns are primed (Study 2c) and when respondents are made to consider the relative intrusiveness of a different set of questions (Study 2d). This research helps illuminate how consumers' propensity to disclose is affected by continual streams of requests for personal information and by the equally unavoidable barrage of personal information about others.","Alessandro Acquisti, Leslie K.

Empirical Entry Games with Complementarities: An Application to the Shopping Center Industry,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0021,01-Apr-12,01-Apr-12,49,2,175,191,"The author proposes a strategic model of entry that allows for positive and negative spillovers among firms. The model is applied to a novel data set containing information about the store configurations of all U.S. regional shopping centers and is used to quantify the magnitude of interstore spillovers. The author addresses the estimation difficulties that arise due to the presence of multiple equilibria by formulating the entry game as a mathematical problem with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). Although this study constitutes the first attempt to use this direct optimization approach to address a specific empirical problem, the method can be used in a wide range of structural estimation problems. The empirical results support the agglomeration and clustering theories that predict that firms may have incentives to colocate despite potential business stealing effects. The author shows that the firms' negative and positive strategic effects help predict both how many firms can operate profitably in a given market and the firm-type configurations.

What Makes Online Content Viral?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0353,01-Apr-12,01-Apr-12,49,2,192,205,"Why are certain pieces of online content (e.g., advertisements, videos, news articles) more viral than others? This article takes a psychological approach to understanding diffusion. Using a unique data set of all the New York Times articles published over a three-month period, the authors examine how emotion shapes virality. The results indicate that positive content is more viral than negative content, but the relationship between emotion and social transmission is more complex than valence alone. Virality is partially driven by physiological arousal. Content that evokes high-arousal positive (awe) or negative (anger or anxiety) emotions is more viral. Content that evokes low-arousal, or deactivating, emotions (e.g., sadness) is less viral. These results hold even when the authors control for how surprising, interesting, or practically useful content is (all of which are positively linked to virality), as well as external drivers of attention (e.g., how prominently content was featured). Experimental results further demonstrate the causal impact of specific emotion on transmission and illustrate that it is driven by the level of activation induced. Taken together, these findings shed light on why people share content and how to design more effective viral marketing campaigns.","Jonah Berger, Katherine L.

The Importance of the Context in Brand Extension: How Pictures and Comparisons Shift Consumers' Focus from Fit to Quality,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.08.0060,01-Apr-12,01-Apr-12,49,2,206,217,"It is well established that consumers' evaluations of brand extensions depend on the quality of the parent brand and the fit between that brand and the extension category. The authors propose that the relative importance of these two factors is influenced by two key features of a typical shopping environment: the presence of visual information and the availability of comparison brands. In particular, the authors demonstrate that adding pictures and enabling brand comparisons shift consumers' preference from extensions of better-fitting brands to extensions of higher-quality brands. The authors propose that this occurs because pictures and brand comparisons create a more concrete representation of the extension, which in turn increases the importance of parent brand quality relative to brand–extension fit.

When Budgeting Backfires: How Self-Imposed Price Restraints Can Increase Spending,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0508,01-Apr-12,01-Apr-12,49,2,218,230,"A common strategy for controlling spending is to impose a price restraint on oneself. For example, a consumer who is concerned with limiting expenses may decide before going shopping that he or she only wants to spend approximately $100 for a particular purchase. Although conventional wisdom predicts that self-imposed price restraints will decrease consumer spending, the authors show that salient price restraints can actually increase consumers' preferences for high-priced, high-quality items. The authors propose that making a price restraint salient has the effect of partitioning consumers' evaluations of price and quality, leading to larger differences in perceived quality between options and a greater focus on quality during the final decision. Thus, while budgets and other types of price restraints can limit spending by eliminating some high-priced options from consideration, this research suggests that they can also have the ironic effect of increasing consumers' spending relative to a situation in which consumers have not imposed a price restraint.","Jeffrey S.

Consumption-Based Cross-Brand Learning: Are Private Labels Really Private?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.07.0416,01-Apr-12,01-Apr-12,49,2,231,246,"While some researchers view private labels (PLs) as a key tool for retailer differentiation, others imply that consumers do not distinguish between PLs of different chains. This debate raises the question: Do a retail chain's PL investments subsidize rival PLs? In addition, how does this affect their choice share vis-à-vis national brands? The authors investigate whether consumers generalize knowledge from product experience across PLs of different retail chains and whether such cross-brand learning depends on the PL brands' link with the chain name or on their quality differences. The proposed brand choice model captures cross-brand learning through quality perception spillovers (consumers adjust beliefs about PL quality on the basis of consumption experience) and familiarity spillovers (uncertainty about a PL diminishes with rival PL consumption). Household scanner panel data on dish soap and breakfast cereals yield clear evidence of cross-retailer learning among standard PLs, regardless of their name or quality differences. The results also reveal that familiarity spillovers dominate quality-level spillovers, implying that the presence of cross-learning benefits PLs and enhances their market position relative to national brands.

The current research addresses the challenge faced by new products that are extremely different from existing offerings by drawing on theory regarding the evaluation of schema incongruity. The authors posit that consumers' acceptance of extremely incongruent products will increase when firms use strategies that facilitate cognitive flexibility and thus the likelihood that consumers will be able to make sense of incongruent new products. The authors examine the influence of three manipulations of cognitive flexibility—positive affect, a future (vs. past) launch description, and a cognitive flexibility prime—on evaluations of new products. The results from four experiments show that these factors facilitate participants' ability to make sense of extremely incongruent new products and that incongruity resolution leads to more positive evaluations. The results also indicate that understanding the benefits provided by extremely new products, rather than affect arising from resolution, leads to higher evaluations of these products.","Ji Hoon Jhang, Susan Jung Grant, Margaret C.

Integrating three archival data sources and a survey of 206 franchisees across eight automotive brands, the authors find that franchisor reliance on contractual completeness appears to result in reduced ex post behavior monitoring and enforcement efforts, while contractual one-sidedness is associated with higher levels of behavior monitoring but reduced enforcement. Extracontractual incentives, when offered to the franchisee, are associated with increases in monitoring and enforcement. In isolation, franchisor monitoring and enforcement efforts are ineffective in eliciting desired franchisee behaviors. However, different combinations of franchisor monitoring and enforcement efforts affect franchisee compliance and opportunism, sometimes with counterproductive results. The study provides an initial baseline of understanding on how ex ante governance characteristics and combinations of ex post governance mechanisms function to facilitate or deter franchisee compliance and opportunism.","Vishal Kashyap, Kersi D.

Searching in Choice Mode: Consumer Decision Processes in Product Search with Recommendations,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.09.0481,01-Apr-12,01-Apr-12,49,2,277,288,"This article examines how a common form of decision assistance— recommendations that present products in order of their predicted attractiveness to a consumer—transforms decision processes during product search. Such recommendations induce a shift in consumers' decision orientation in search from being directed at whether additional alternatives should be inspected to identifying the best alternative among those already encountered, which is common when choosing from predetermined sets of alternatives. That is, recommendations cause consumers to search in “choice mode.” Evidence from three studies provides support for such a transformation of search decisions, which manifests itself in two respects. First, compared with unassisted search, recommendations lead consumers to assess a product they encounter in their search by comparing it less with the best one discovered up to that point and more with other previously inspected alternatives. Second, recommendations transform how variability in product attractiveness affects stopping decisions such that greater variability causes consumers to search less, which is contrary to what is commonly observed in search without recommendations.","Benedict G.C.

Spatiotemporal Allocation of Advertising Budgets,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0029,01-Feb-12,01-Feb-12,49,1,1,14,"This article develops a method for optimal allocation of resources based on an empirically validated model of how national and regional advertising generate sales over time. The authors derive the profit-maximizing total budget, its optimal split between national and regional spends, and its optimal allocation across multiple regions. They formulate a spatiotemporal model that accounts for spatial and serial dependence, spatial heterogeneity, neighborhood effects, and sales dynamics. Because of spatial and serial dependence, correlated multivariate Brownian motion drives the sales dynamics, resulting in a second-order differential equation for the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation with multiple states (i.e., regional sales) and multiple controls (i.e., regional and national advertising expenditures). By solving the HJB equation analytically, the authors furnish closed-form expressions for the optimal total budget and its regional allocations. In addition, they develop a method to estimate the proposed model and apply it to market data from a leading German cosmetics company. Using the estimated parameters, they evaluate the optimal budget and allocations. Comparing them with actual company policy, the proposed approach enhances profit by 5.07%, and it not only identifies which regions under-or overspend but also reveals how much budget to shift from national to regional advertising (or vice versa).","Ashwin Aravindakshan, Kay Peters, Prasad A.

Self-Signaling and the Costs and Benefits of Temptation in Consumer Choice,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.10.0490,10-Oct-18,01-Feb-12,49,1,15,25,"The literature on self-control emphasizes that temptation is costly.

Succumbing to temptation is a (costly) self-signal of weak willpower, whereas resisting temptation is a (beneficial) self-signal of strong willpower. Five experiments demonstrate that these self-signaling costs and benefits of temptation depend not only on the chosen item but also on the temptation from the nonchosen options.

While effectiveness cues may increase initial purchase, they can curb postpurchase consumption and potentially decrease long-term product sales. Four studies demonstrate that salient cues in advertising or packaging (e.g., pictures, brand names) can increase perceived product efficacy and lead to a lower usage amount on a single occasion. The authors show that the impact of effectiveness cues on product usage is driven by inference making and is moderated by cue salience and people's need for cognition. Furthermore, the authors find that promoting effectiveness with certain cues does not increase product choice yet reduces product usage. These results stress the importance of seeking salient cues that work to stimulate both choice and usage.","Meng Zhu, Darron M. Billeter, J.

To explain this effect, the authors argue that consumers uncertain about the importance of quality learn from observing market outcomes.

The Impact of an Item-Based Loyalty Program on Consumer Purchase Behavior,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.09.0211,01-Feb-12,01-Feb-12,49,1,50,65,"The authors conduct an empirical investigation of a new retail loyalty program (LP), called an item-based loyalty program (IBLP), in which price discounts are replaced by reward point promotions that need to be accumulated and redeemed later. The main objective is to examine its impact on various aspects of consumer purchase behavior and a retailer's sales revenue. They find that after a retailer switched from a conventional LP to the IBLP, consumers became more responsive to reward point promotions than to price discounts of the same monetary value, were no longer responsive to competitors' reward point promotions, and exhibited stronger cumulative reward point effects. In addition, the new LP had a significantly different impact on “current” LP members and nonmembers (defined by their status right before the switch), resulting in decreased (increased) total spending by the former (latter) group, under the retailer's current promotion practice. Furthermore, it is critically important for retailers to offer sufficient promotions under the new LP to achieve its full potential; otherwise, they risk alienating their loyal customers. Finally, the IBLP reduced attrition among existing customers and attracted more new customers, which contributed to most of the retailer's sales revenue gain after adopting the IBLP.","Jie Zhang, Els Breugelmans","retail management, loyalty program design, promotion strategy, reward point promotions, retailer–manufacturer collaboration",7
Paying with Money or Effort: Pricing When Customers Anticipate Hassle,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmr.09.0530,01-Feb-12,01-Feb-12,49,1,66,82,"For many services, customers subscribe to long-term contracts. Standard economic theory suggests that customers evaluate a contract on the basis of its overall net benefits. The authors suggest that rather than evaluating multiperiod service contracts at the contract level, customers use period-level bracketing. Customers evaluate the distinct per-period loss or gain they incur from choosing this contract. This has important consequences when benefits vary over the course of the contract—for example, due to “hassle costs.” If customers use period-level bracketing, they will value a lower price more in periods during which they have hassle than in other periods. The authors explore this using data from a field experiment for web hosting services. They find that a lower price in the initial period is more attractive to customers when they expect their hassle costs to be high at setup. In five lab experiments, the authors support and extend the field experiment's findings. They find evidence for period-level bracketing when customers have hassle costs, independently of whether hassle costs occur in the first, an intermediate, or the last period of a contract. They also rule out alternative explanations, such as hyperbolic discounting. The findings suggest that in setting prices, firms should consider the timing of hassle costs customers face.","Anja Lambrecht, Catherine Tucker","pricing, services, field experiment, contractual discounting, hassle costs, period-level bracketing",0

The profile of the readers matters because advertisers want to target readers who are likely to be receptive to their advertising messages. The authors demonstrate that when advertising supplements subscription fees, it may serve as a polarizing or moderating force, contingent on the extent of heterogeneity among advertisers in appealing to readers having different political preferences. When heterogeneity is large, each advertiser chooses a single outlet for placing advertisements (single-homing), and greater polarization arises in comparison to when the media outlet relies on subscription fees only for revenues. In contrast, when heterogeneity is small, each advertiser chooses to place advertisements in multiple outlets (multihoming) and reduces polarization results.","Esther Gal-or, Tansev Geylani, Tuba Pinar Yildirim","media competition, bias in news, advertising, two-sided markets",0

The study demonstrates that when formats have equivalent quality on a salient attribute, consumers perceive the formats as more complementary and are more likely to buy the bundle.

The results show that the firm faces reinforcing cross-market effects, its demand from both groups depends on marketing investments, and the model exhibits good forecasting capability. The authors use the estimated response model to determine optimal marketing investments over a finite planning horizon and find that the firm should significantly increase its newsroom and sales force investments.

In contrast, the authors propose and demonstrate that a single goal evokes a stronger implementation intention, which in turn has a greater effect on behavior change.

This study tests the hypothesis using data from three laboratory experiments in which participants play a time-management game that involves waiting for downloads from different computer servers, as well as field data about hang-ups in an emergency call center in India.

Contrary to expectations based on business press commentary, after controlling for seasonality and movie attributes, the authors find low cross-channel price and availability elasticity for both channels. To measure the extent of cross-channel cannibalization, they simulate a 28-day window of sequential release with either purchase or rental channel going first. They find that windowing reduces the sum of revenues across both channels, because more consumers choose to not purchase or rent when faced with older movies in their favored channel rather than to switch to the alternative channel with newer movies.","Anirban Mukherjee, Vrinda Kadiyali","multiple channel demand, market share, seasonality, entertainment industry",0

The results demonstrate that when a product is positioned on functional dimensions, consumers show more preferential evaluations for moderately incongruent form than for congruent form. However, when a product is positioned on experiential dimensions, consumers show more preferential evaluations for congruent form than for moderately incongruent form. Importantly, an increase in perceived hedonic benefits mediates the former, whereas a decrease in perceived utilitarian benefits mediates the latter.

This research proposes that because consumers’ certainty about their beliefs (e.g., attitudes, opinions) is less salient than the beliefs themselves, certainty information is more susceptible to being lost in communication. Consistent with this idea, the current studies reveal that though consumers transmit their core beliefs when they communicate with one another, they often fail to transmit their certainty or uncertainty about those beliefs. Thus, a belief originally associated with high uncertainty (certainty) tends to lose this uncertainty (certainty) across communications. The authors demonstrate that increasing the salience of consumers’ uncertainty/certainty when communicating or receiving information can improve uncertainty/certainty communication, and they investigate the consequences for rumor management and word-of-mouth communications.","David Dubois, Derek D.

These studies demonstrate that arm flexion (in which the motor action is directed toward the self) versus arm extension (in which the motor action is directed away from the self) influences purchase behavior, product preferences, and economic decisions. More specifically, arm flexion increases the likelihood of purchasing vice products (Study 1a), leads to a preference for vices over virtues (Studies 1b and 2a), and leads to preference for smaller, sooner over larger, later monetary rewards (Studies 2b, 3, and 4). The authors argue that arm flexion induces present-biased preferences through activation of approach motivation. The effect of bodily actions on present-biased preferences is regulated by the behavioral approach system (Studies 3 and 4) and relies on the learned association between arm flexion and activation of this approach system (Study 4).

The authors propose that when progress toward attaining a goal is low, consumers are primarily concerned about the question “Can I get there?” Thus, a high (vs. low) perceived velocity in progressing suggests greater expectations of goal attainment, resulting in greater motivation for pursuing the goal. However, when consumers have achieved sufficient progress and are approaching the end point, their attainment of the goal is relatively secured, so they become more concerned about the question “When will I get there?” and focus more on whether they are effectively reducing the remaining discrepancy so that they can attain the goal quickly. In this case, a low (vs. high) perceived velocity in progressing elicits greater motivation because it suggests that continued effort is needed to ensure a speedy attainment.

Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, the authors measure the impact of ad placement on both click-through and conversion rates. They find that while click-through rate decreases with position, conversion rate increases with position and is even higher for more specific keywords. The net effect is that, contrary to the conventional wisdom in the industry, the topmost position is not necessarily the revenue-or profit-maximizing position. The authors’ results inform the advertising strategies of firms participating in sponsored search auctions and provide insight into consumer behavior in these environments. Specifically, they help correct a significant misunderstanding among advertisers regarding the value of the top position.

Fast-Food Consumption and the Ban on Advertising Targeting Children: The Quebec Experience,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.5.799,01-Oct-11,01-Oct-11,48,5,799,813,"Amid growing concerns about childhood obesity and the associated health risks, several countries are considering banning fast-food advertising targeting children. In this article, the authors study the effect of such a ban in the Canadian province of Quebec. Using household expenditure survey data from 1984 to 1992, authors examine whether expenditure on fast food is lower in those groups affected by the ban than in those that are not. The authors use a triple difference-indifference methodology by appropriately defining treatment and control groups and find that the ban's effectiveness is not a result of the decrease in fast food expenditures per week but rather of the decrease in purchase propensity by 13% per week. Overall, the authors estimate that the ban reduced fast-food consumption by Us$88 million per year. The study suggests that advertising bans can be effective provided media markets do not overlap.","Tirtha Dhar, Kathy Baylis","advertising regulation, fast food, obesity, difference-in-difference estimator",28
Relaxation Increases Monetary Valuations,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.5.814,10-Oct-18,01-Oct-11,48,5,814,826,"This research documents an intriguing empirical phenomenon whereby states of relaxation increase the monetary valuation of products. The authors demonstrate this phenomenon in six experiments involving two methods of inducing relaxation, a large number of products of different types, and various methods of assessing monetary valuation. In all six experiments, participants who were put into a relaxed affective state reported higher monetary valuations than participants who were put into an equally pleasant but less relaxed state. This effect seems to be caused by differences in relaxed and nonrelaxed people's mental construals of the value of the products. Specifically, compared with less relaxed people, relaxed people seem to represent the value of products at a higher level of abstraction, which increases their perceptions of these products' value. The phenomenon appears to reflect an inflation of value by relaxed people rather than a deflation of value by less relaxed people.","Michel Tuan Pham, Iris W. Hung, Gerald J.

The article begins with the premise that when consumers do not have well-formed preferences for a product, they tend to focus on the usage process. The authors predict and find that outcome simulation is more effective than process simulation in increasing product evaluation under a cognitive mode, whereas process simulation is more effective than outcome simulation under an affective mode. Establishing boundary conditions, the authors further show the effect of two important moderators that alter consumers' focus on/away from the product's usage process. Specifically, they show a reversal of the effect for each type of mental simulation for hedonic products, for which product benefits are the more salient aspect (vs. the usage process). Furthermore, a distant-future (vs. near-future) evaluation frame shifts people's focus away from the usage process toward product benefits and reverses the effect of each type of simulation.

More specifically, they investigate how decision processes and preferences change when consumers have a no-choice option versus when they are forced to choose from a given choice set. They propose that the inclusion of a no-choice option in a choice set affects preferences by leading consumers to determine not only which alternative is best, but which, if any, are acceptable (i.e., meet the consumer's minimum needs). Accordingly, the authors demonstrate that the inclusion of a no-choice option in the choice set (1) leads to more alternative- (rather than attribute-) based information processing, (2) increases the importance of attributes that are more meaningful when alternatives are evaluated one by one (i.e., enriched attributes), and (3) increases the importance of attributes with levels that are closer to the consumer's minimum needs (thresholds). They demonstrate that such changes influence consumers' preference structures and ultimate choices.

In doing so, they demonstrate the interplay between self-construal and a specific social identity (i.e., that associated with the particular charity featured in a donation-based promotion) on consumers' preferences for these two types of promotions. The results show that, in general, consumers possessing interdependent self-construals prefer donations to a greater extent than those with independent self-construals. However, the findings further indicate that these effects of self-construal are attenuated if (1) the donation-based promotion does not involve a charity that is identity congruent or (2) a cause-congruent identity is more salient than self-construal at the time of decision making. The authors also identify boundary conditions of charity efficiency and product type for these self-construal effects.

Classic challenges in marketing such as pricing, campaign management, brand positioning, and new product development are rooted in an analysis of product substitutes and complements inferred from market structure. In this article, the authors present a method to support the analysis and visualization of market structure by automatically eliciting product attributes and brand's relative positions from online customer reviews. First, the method uncovers attributes and attribute dimensions using the “voice of the consumer,” as reflected in customer reviews, rather than that of manufacturers. Second, the approach runs automatically. Third, the process supports rather than supplants managerial judgment by reinforcing or augmenting attributes and dimensions found through traditional surveys and focus groups. The authors test the approach on six years of customer reviews for digital cameras during a period of rapid market evolution. They analyze and visualize results in several ways, including comparisons with expert buying guides, a laboratory survey, and correspondence analysis of automatically discovered product attributes.

They analyze how personality trait inferences based on candidate appearance interact with political party brand image, advertising spending, and negative advertising. The results indicate that appearance-based inferences about candidates influence election outcomes, but their impact is driven partially by trait associations at the party brand level. This interaction between appearance and party alters the effects of advertising spending, particularly the effects of negative advertising.

However, they also show that the weights can be shifted systematically by (1) directly manipulating the importance of the trade-in and (2) indirectly priming a seller (vs. buyer) mind-set.

Moreover, relational behavior diminishes financial performance when what is exchanged must be directly comparable in form (i.e., homeomorphic equivalence reciprocity) or returned over a short time horizon (i.e., short-term immediacy reciprocity). The authors further conclude that a longitudinal interaction effect model provides a more accurate understanding of the relational behavior–performance relationship when compared with a cross-sectional interaction effect model, because it minimizes the unobserved heterogeneity effect, thus strengthening causal inference.","Jessica J.

Tariff Choice with Consumer Learning and Switching Costs,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.4.633,01-Aug-11,01-Aug-11,48,4,633,652,"Consumers choosing flat-rate contracts tend to have insufficient usage to warrant the cost, particularly for new products. We propose and estimate a Bayesian learning model of tariff and usage choice that explains this flat-rate bias without relying on behavioral misjudgments or tariff-specific preferences. For new products, consumers are uncertain about both their utility relative to the population mean and the mean itself. We show that this latter uncertainty inflates prior variances, which leads consumers to weight their private signals more heavily when updating beliefs. Posteriors are unbiased across products. For a given product, however, the unknown mean yields a “winner's curse”: Consumers with high posteriors tend to overestimate their utility. These consumers choose fixed-rate tariffs and lower their usage as they correct their beliefs. The flat-rate bias arises when switching costs deter them from changing tariffs. Using the estimated model, the authors find that tariff menus are ineffective screening devices for price discrimination by an online grocer. Predicted revenues increase by 20% when the per-use tariff is dropped, because more consumers choose and stay with the flat rate.","Ronald L.

In a departure from the commonly made full information assumption, they incorporate limited information in the form of choice sets to reflect that consumers may not be aware of all available brands at purchase time. They find that both the estimated brand constants and the price coefficient are biased downward when consumer heterogeneity in choice sets is ignored. These biased estimates can lead firms to make costly price-setting mistakes. In addition, the tracking data enable the authors to identify separately two processes by which advertising influences market shares. They find that advertising has a direct effect on brand awareness (inclusion in choice set) in addition to its effect on consumer preferences (increase in utility).

Consumers whose preferences are dissimilar to the majority—”preference minorities”—are underserved offline and should be more likely to shop online. The authors use sales data from Diapers.com, the leading U.S. online retailer for baby diapers, to show why geographic variation in preference minority status of target customers explains geographic variation in online sales. They find that, holding the absolute number of the target customers constant, online category sales are more than 50% higher in locations where customers suffer from preference isolation. Because customers in the preference minority face higher offline shopping costs, they are also less price sensitive. Niche brands, compared with popular brands, show even greater offline-to-online sales substitution. This greater sensitivity to preference isolation means that these brands in the tail of the long tail distribution draw a greater proportion of their total sales from high–preference minority regions.

The authors propose a customer-response model that recognizes the evolvement of customer demand for various products; the possible multifaceted roles of cross-selling solicitations for promotion, advertising, and education; and customer heterogeneous preference for communication channels. They formulate cross-selling campaigns as solutions to a stochastic dynamic programming problem in which the firm's goal is to maximize the long-term profit of its existing customers while taking into account the development of customer demand over time and the multistage role of cross-selling promotion. The model yields optimal cross-selling strategies for how to introduce the right product to the right customer at the right time using the right communication channel. Applying the model to panel data with cross-selling solicitations provided by a national bank, the authors demonstrate that households have different preferences and responsiveness to cross-selling solicitations. In addition to generating immediate sales, cross-selling solicitations also help households move faster along the financial continuum (educational role) and build up goodwill (advertising role). A decomposition analysis shows that the educational effect (83%) largely dominates the advertising effect (15%) and instantaneous promotional effect (2%).

Finally, results indicate that if product information is not externally available (i.e., it must be recalled from memory), people are more likely to focus on pleasure and fail at self-regulation.

When the difficulty experienced during decisions later in the process deviates from that which occurs earlier in the process, consumer preference is affected by the discrepancy between actual and expected difficulty. Specifically, the results show that when the difficulty experienced during feature decisions deviates from expectations, consumers may spend more or less money on product features as a result of discrepant fluency than when they perform the same task and the level of difficulty is expected. The results demonstrate that discrepant fluency effects are not limited to sequential decisions but can influence a single feature decision, which was accomplished by altering consumers’ expectations before the decision. These discrepant fluency effects emerge even when the attributes of the alternatives and the composition of the focal decision settings remain the same.","Keith Wilcox, Sangyoung Song","fluency, customization, decision framing, sequential choice, expectations",0

That is, consumers who are agency oriented spend significantly more when they shop with a friend (vs. when they shop alone), whereas this effect is attenuated for consumers who are communion oriented. The results also show that this interactive effect is moderated by individual differences in self-monitoring such that friends are especially influential for consumers who are high in self-monitoring, but the effects occur in opposite directions for agency- and communion-oriented consumers (i.e., agentic consumers spend more with a friend, while communal consumers spend less when accompanied by a friend). Finally, the authors test the underlying process and document that the interaction of agency–communion orientation, the presence of a friend, and self-monitoring is reversed when the focal context is changed from “spending for the self” to “donating to a charity.” They conclude with a discussion of implications for research and practice.","Didem Kurt, J.

As shown in four studies, these problem types respond similarly to manipulations that trigger or suppress self-expression. Specifically, priming self-expression systematically increases the share of the self-expressive options across choice problems. Conversely, expecting to be evaluated decreases the share of the self-expressive options across the various choice dilemmas. In addition, priming risk seeking increases only the choice of risky gambles but not of other self-expressive options.

Incorporating Context Effects into a Choice Model,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.4.767,16-Oct-18,01-Aug-11,48,4,767,780,"The behavioral literature provides ample evidence that consumer preferences are partly driven by the context provided by the set of alternatives. Three important context effects are the compromise, attraction, and similarity effects. Because these context effects affect choices in a systematic and predictable way, it should be possible to incorporate them in a choice model. However, the literature does not offer such a choice model. This study fills this gap by proposing a discrete-choice model that decomposes a product's utility into a context-free partworth utility and a context-dependent component capturing all three context effects. Model estimation results on choice-based conjoint data involving digital cameras provide convincing statistical evidence for context effects. The estimated context effects are consistent with the predictions from the behavioral literature, and accounting for context effects leads to better predictions both in and out of sample. To illustrate the benefit from incorporating context effects in a choice model, the authors discuss how firms could utilize the context sensitivity of consumers to design more profitable product lines.","Robert P.

Consistent with standard agency arguments, the authors find that firms use higher-powered incentives as the importance of agent effort increases. At the same time, the authors find strong support for the selection role of these contracts. Specifically, agents with greater selling ability and lower risk aversion are associated with jobs offering higher-powered incentives. Finally, consistent with prior findings on incentive contracts, the authors find no support for the insurance implication of the typical agency model.

Network Effects and Personal Influences: The Diffusion of an Online Social Network,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.3.425,01-Jun-11,01-Jun-11,48,3,425,443,"This article discusses the diffusion process in an online social network given the individual connections between members. The authors model the adoption decision of individuals as a binary choice affected by three factors: (1) the local network structure formed by already adopted neighbors, (2) the average characteristics of adopted neighbors (influencers), and (3) the characteristics of the potential adopters. Focusing on the first factor, the authors find two marked effects. First, an individual who is connected to many adopters has a greater adoption probability (degree effect). Second, the density of connections in a group of already adopted consumers has a strong positive effect on the adoption of individuals connected to this group (clustering effect). The article also records significant effects for influencer and adopter characteristics. For adopters, specifically, the authors find that position in the entire network and some demographic variables are good predictors of adoption. Similarly, in the case of already adopted individuals, average demographics and global network position can predict their influential power on their neighbors. An interesting counterintuitive finding is that the average influential power of individuals decreases with the total number of their contacts. These results have practical implications for viral marketing, a context in which a variety of technology platforms are increasingly considering leveraging their consumers' revealed connection patterns. The model performs particularly well in predicting the next set of adopters.","Zsolt Katona, Peter Pal Zubcsek, Miklos Sarvary","diffusion, social networks, network marketing",6
The Value of Social Dynamics in Online Product Ratings Forums,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.3.444,01-Jun-11,01-Jun-11,48,3,444,456,"Research has shown that consumer online product ratings reflect both the customers' experience with the product and the influence of others' ratings. In this article, the authors measure the impact of social dynamics in the ratings environment on both subsequent rating behavior and product sales. First, they model the arrival of product ratings and separate the effects of social influences from the underlying (or baseline) ratings behavior. Second, the authors model product sales as a function of posted product ratings while decomposing ratings into a baseline rating, the contribution of social influence, and idiosyncratic error. This enables them to quantify the sales impact of observed social dynamics. The authors consider both the direct effects on sales and the indirect effects that result from the influence of dynamics on future ratings (and thus future sales). The results show that although ratings behavior is significantly influenced by previously posted ratings and can directly improve sales, the effects are relatively short lived once indirect effects are considered.","Wendy W.

How Well Does Advertising Work?

The study finds several new empirical generalizations about advertising elasticity. The most important are as follows: the average short-term advertising elasticity is .12, which is substantially lower than the prior meta-analytic mean of .22; there has been a decline in the advertising elasticity over time; and advertising elasticity is higher (1) for durable goods than nondurable goods, (2) in the early stage than the mature stage of the life cycle, (3) for yearly data than quarterly data, and (4) when advertising is measured in gross rating points than monetary terms. The mean long-term advertising elasticity is .24, which is much lower than the implied mean in the prior meta-analysis (.41). many of the results for short-term elasticity hold for long-term elasticity, with some notable exceptions. The authors discuss the implications of these findings.","Raj Sethuraman, Gerard J. Tellis, Richard A.

This is an important, substantive finding that persisted over a significant time span. in addition, in two additional laboratory studies, they find further evidence for this matching hypothesis, in which a pairing of loss- (gain-) framed messages that activates more concrete (abstract) mind-sets leads to enhanced processing fluency, increased efficacy, and, as a result, more positive recycling intentions.

Drawing on research on psychological distance and the “fit” literature, the authors hypothesize that others' recommendations are more persuasive when the construal levels associated with both social distance and temporal distance are congruent. Specifically, the authors first demonstrate a time-contingent effect of recommendation: Others' recommendations lead to a greater preference shift when people make decisions for distant-future consumption than for near-future consumption (Studies 1 and 2). Second, contrary to conventional wisdom, the authors find that close others do not always have a greater impact than distant others. instead, recommendations from close others are more influential in shifting near-future preferences than those from distant others, whereas recommendations from distant others are more influential than those from close others in shifting distant-future preferences (Study 3). The authors demonstrate that others' recommendations are perceived to be more relevant as the underlying mechanism when there is a match of construal levels between the social and temporal distance.

To measure consumer preferences for new product concepts, the authors apply a “securities trading of concepts,” or STOC, approach, in which new product concepts are traded as financial securities. The authors apply this method because market prices are known to efficiently collect and aggregate private information regarding the economic value of goods, services, and firms, particularly when trading financial securities. This research compares the STOC approach against stated-choice, conjoint, constant-sum, and longitudinal revealed-preference data. The authors also place STOC in the context of previous research on prediction markets and experimental economics. Across multiple product categories, the authors test whether STOC (1) is more cost efficient than other methods, (2) passes validity tests, (3) measures expectations of others, and (4) reveals individual preferences, not just those of the crowd. The results show that traders exhibit a self-preference bias when trading. Ultimately, STOC offers two key advantages over traditional market research methods: cost efficiency and scalability. For new product development teams deciding how to invest resources, this scalability may be especially important in the Web 2.0 world.","Ely Dahan, Adlar J. Kim, Andrew W.

Estimating the Value of Brand-Image Associations: The Role of General and Specific Brand Image,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.3.518,01-Jun-11,01-Jun-11,48,3,518,531,"The authors present a Bayesian simultaneous choice factor model that measures consumers' willingness to pay for brand-image associations. Previous research has found that general brand effects influence a brand's scores on specific image dimensions. To investigate the value of general versus specific brand image, the authors specify a higher-order factor model in which a set of correlated factor scores arise from a general brand factor and a set of orthogonal residual scores that measure the specific dimensions of brand image. The general brand factor is consistent with the concept of a halo effect, which theory ascribes to either an overall evaluative effect or errors in cognition. The authors apply the model to stated preference data on branded midsized sedans accompanied by data on consumer brand-image associations. The authors find that there is substantial value for the specific dimensions of brand image, but only after controlling for the general brand effect with the higher-order factor decomposition.","Garrett Sonnier, Andrew Ainslie","choice models, factor models, Bayesian methods",0

Two studies measure participants' levels of thinking in two different ways, showing that positive affect can promote forward-looking, high-level thinking. Two studies using a delay-of-gratification paradigm demonstrate this forward-looking thinking and show it to be a mindful process. Participants in positive (vs. neutral) affect were more likely to choose a larger mail-in rebate over a smaller instant rebate when the reward differences were moderate (but not when they were small). Two studies demonstrate the impact of positive affect on intertemporal preference in another way, showing that participants in positive affect do not discount the value of delayed outcomes as much as people in neutral affect do (decreased present bias). Together, the results indicate that positive affect promotes cognitive flexibility and fosters a higher level of thinking and a more future-oriented time perspective, without obscuring practical considerations and other needed detail, including context and opportunity costs, when evaluating intertemporal options.","Jin Seok Pyone, Alice M.

In this research, the authors show that this seemingly suboptimal behavior may actually confer benefits when factoring in the social context of consumption. The results demonstrate that choosing products with more capabilities (i.e., feature-rich products) provides social utility beyond inferences of wealth, signaling consumers' technological skills and openness to new experiences and that consumers' beliefs about the social utility of feature-rich products are predictive of their choices of such products. Furthermore, the authors examine when impression management concerns increase consumers' likelihood of choosing feature-rich products. They find that public choices in which participants display their preferences to others encourage feature-seeking behavior but that the anticipation of having to use a product in front of others provides an incentive to avoid additional features.","Debora V.

The authors consider a game-theoretic model in which firms compete for advertising positions and then compete in price for customers in a product market. Firms differ in their competence, and positions are differentiated in their prominence, which reflects consumers' online search behavior. They find that when endogenously evaluated within the product market competition, a prominent advertising position might not always be desirable for a firm with competitive advantage, even if it is cost-free. The profitability of a prominent advertising position depends on the trade-off between the extra demand from winning the position and the higher equilibrium prices when the weaker competitor wins it. Furthermore, the authors show that the bidding outcome might not align with the relative competitive strength, and an advantaged firm might not be able to win the prominent position even when it values that position. They derive two-dimensional equilibrium price dispersion with the realized prices at the same position varying and the expected prices differing across different positions. They find that the expected price in the prominent position might not always be higher, implying that an expensive location does not necessarily lead to expensive products.","Lizhen Xu, Jianqing Chen, Andrew Whinston","price competition, endogenous valuation, search advertising, online search, price dispersion, bidding incentive",0
Effects of Customer and Innovation Asset Configuration Strategies on Firm Performance,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.3.587,01-Jun-11,01-Jun-11,48,3,587,602,"Both customer and innovation assets are important to firm performance. Prior research has mostly examined these assets at the firm level and has not distinguished between the effects of asset depth relative to competitors and asset breadth across different segments. Using configuration theory and the resource-based view of the firm, the authors propose that how these assets interact to influence performance depends on both depth and breadth because these features reflect whether the assets are likely to create and/or appropriate value when deployed. Empirical results from two studies—one using secondary data and another using primary data from a survey of senior managers—indicate that performance is highest when firms employ configurations using deep customer and broad innovation assets or deep innovation and broad customer assets. In contrast, firm performance variability decreases in the presence of deep–deep and broad–broad asset configurations.

Data were collected in the fashion apparel market of South Korea using multisource, reciprocally matched data in which a manufacturer's directly employed sales force is deployed at department store retailers as the sole frontline employees for their brand.

The authors demonstrate that this effect holds in a single-offering, single-reviewer context. The authors also show that when consumers are exposed to multiple offerings with multiple reviewers, there may be a slight “cost” to ambiguity as opposed to similarity but that ambiguity remains much more persuasive than dissimilarity. Finally, the authors demonstrate that the effects of egocentric anchoring on persuasion can be moderated, first, by making other-related thoughts accessible and, second, by providing external cues about potential reviewer heterogeneity.

The results show that people are 8% less likely to say that they will purchase an alcoholic beverage in states that have alcohol advertising bans compared with states that do not. For consumers exposed to online advertising, this gap narrows to 3%. There are similar effects for four changes in local offline alcohol advertising restrictions when advertising effectiveness is observed both before and after the change. The effect of online advertising is disproportionately high for new products and for products with low awareness in places that have bans. This suggests that online advertising could reduce the effectiveness of attempts to regulate offline advertising channels because online advertising substitutes for (rather than complements) offline advertising.","Avi Goldfarb, Catherine Tucker","advertising, regulation, advertising media mix, Internet",15

Despite this complementary attraction, tightwad–spendthrift differences within a marriage predict conflict over finances, which in turn predicts diminished marital well-being.

An intriguing finding is that while negative WOM is more influential than positive WOM, positive OL information significantly increases sales, but negative OL information has no effect. This suggests that reporting consumer purchase statistics can help mass-market products without hurting niche products. The results also reveal that the sales impact of OL increases with WOM volume.","Yubo Chen, Qi Wang, Jinhong Xie","social interactions, social influences, observational learning, word of mouth, natural experiment",0

They estimate this model using a scanner panel data set that includes consumer purchase history before, during, and after a product-harm crisis that affected Kraft Foods australia's peanut butter division in June 1996. The proposed model fits the data better than the standard consumer learning model, which assumes consumers are uncertain about product quality level but the precision of information in conveying product quality is known.

The authors propose that the intrapersonal conflict that is evoked by choices involving incompatible goals can be resolved through scope-insensitive justifications. The authors describe one such mechanism, the “mere token” effect, a new phenomenon in decision making. They demonstrate that adding a certain and immediate mere token amount to both options increases choices of the later-larger option in intertemporal choice and of the riskier-larger option in risky choice. The authors find this effect to be scope insensitive, such that the size of the token amount does not moderate the effect. They show that intrapersonal choice conflict underlies the mere token effect and that reducing the degree of conflict by increasing the psychological distance to the choice outcomes debiases the effect. Moreover, they show that the mere token effect is enhanced when (1) opposing goals in choice are made salient and (2) the choice options represent a starker contrast that generates greater conflict. The authors empirically rule out alternative explanations, including diminishing marginal utility, normative and descriptive utility-based models, liquidity constraints, and naive diversification. They discuss the direct implications of the mere token effect for the marketing of financial services and, more generally, for consumer preference toward bundles and multiattribute products.","Oleg Urminsky, Ran Kivetz","choice conflict, intertemporal choice, risky choice, financial decision making, justification",0

Specifically, this article examines the case of consumers who value being unconstrained: people with independent self-construals and those who have high levels of reactance motivation. The authors argue that these people often view self-knowledge as a constraint on the self and subsequently reject it—even when the self-knowledge has neutral or positive implications for self-esteem. Results across five studies demonstrate that independents and high reactants feel constrained by self-knowledge, and this causes them to reject and make consumption choices inconsistent with it even as they actively seek to learn about themselves. In contrast, interdependents and low reactants do not feel constrained by self-knowledge, and consequently, they accept and incorporate it into their consumption decisions.","Eugenia C. Wu, Keisha M.

The authors demonstrate that to complicate their choices, consumers increase choice conflict by overweighting small disadvantages of superior alternatives, converging overall evaluations of alternatives, reversing preference ordering, and even choosing less preferred alternatives. Furthermore, the results from five studies support a unifying theoretical framework: the effort–compatibility principle. Specifically, the authors argue that consumers strive for compatibility between the effort they anticipate and the effort that they actually exert. When a decision seems more difficult than initially expected, a simplifying process ensues. However, when the decision seems easier to resolve than anticipated (e.g., when consumers face an important yet easy choice), consumers artificially increase their effort.","Rom Y.

Inventory shortages can have adverse consequences on both short- and long-term customer behaviors. Using data from an online grocer, this study has the following three main objectives: First, the authors empirically investigate the true nature of shortage costs by examining how stockouts and fulfillment rates affect customer's purchase behavior in both the short and long run. Second, the authors study how consumers’ reactions to inventory shortages differ across customer segments. They use these observations to illustrate how the seller might benefit from prioritizing fulfillment policies according to customer traits. Third, the authors study how the impact of inventory shortages varies across product categories. Using these insights, the authors discuss how the seller should allocate limited resources to improve order fulfillment across these categories. Overall, the authors find that stockout rates have a dramatic but nonlinear impact on the seller's profitability. This suggests that the firm can achieve many of the benefits of improving fulfillment rates through small decreases in stockout rates. They also find significant differences in how different types of customers respond to stockouts and that prioritizing inventory according to transaction history measures and basket contents can lead to large increases in contribution while only requiring moderate reductions in stockout rates.","Xiaoqing Jing, Michael Lewis","customer relationship management, customer lifetime value, yield management, customization, stockouts",0

Four studies show the deliberate consideration of price anchors that can play a key role in whether the effect of the anchors will generalize across product categories. Specifically, an explicit comparison of a product to a price anchor increases the accessibility of features that represent a product available at this price. In turn, these thoughts influence the price that consumers are willing to pay for these products.

Shaping Consumer Imaginations: The Role of Self-Focused Attention in Product Evaluations,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.2.381,01-Apr-11,01-Apr-11,48,2,381,392,"Consumers’ attraction to a product can often be based on the subjective reactions that they imagine they would have if they personally used it. Three experiments examine the effects of self-focused attention on the use of this criterion and the conditions in which it is applied. When features of the judgment (social or nonsocial) context are similar to those of the situation in which the products are normally used, self-focused attention increases participants’ disposition to imagine themselves using the products they evaluate, and in turn, these imaginings increase both their evaluations of these products and their likelihood of choosing these products as a gift for taking part in the experiment. The effects occur when features of the judgment context are manipulated both by incidental background music and by the presence of others in the situation at hand. However, when either self-focused attention is low or features of the judgment context are dissimilar to those in which the products are normally used, these effects are not apparent.","Iris W.

The novel insight on which this research is based is that the aesthetic incongruity involving products high in design salience is more likely than aesthetic incongruity involving products low in design salience to be resolved by accommodating the product within the consumption environment, often through additional purchases. Furthermore, the relative presence of frustration versus regret is shown to mediate the relationship between design salience and the decision to buy more.","Vanessa M.

Self-Regulatory Strength and Consumers’ Relinquishment of Decision Control: When Less Effortful Decisions Are More Resource Depleting,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.2.403,01-Apr-11,01-Apr-11,48,2,403,412,"Using the self-regulatory strength model and prior research on self-esteem threats, the authors predict and show that delegating decisions to surrogates (e.g., financial advisors, physicians) depletes consumers’ limited self-regulatory resources more than making the same decisions independently, thus impairing their subsequent ability to exercise self-control. This is the case even though decision delegation actually requires less decision-making effort than independent decision making (Study 1). However, the resource-depleting effect of decision delegation vanishes when consumers have an opportunity to affirm their belief in free will (Study 2). Moreover, when people remember a past decision that they delegated, their self-control is impaired more than when they remember a decision made independently (Studies 3 and 4). The authors conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.","Murat Usta, Gerald Häubl","consumer decision assistance, delegation, relinquishment of control, self-regulation, depletion",0
Misunderstanding Savings Growth: Implications for Retirement Savings Behavior,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.SPL.S1,06-Mar-19,01-Feb-11,48,S,S1,S13,"People systematically underestimate exponential growth. This article illustrates this phenomenon, its implications, and some potential interventions in the context of saving for retirement, where savings grow exponentially over long periods of time. Experiment 1 shows that a majority of participants expect savings over 40 years to grow linearly rather than exponentially, leading them to grossly underestimate their account balance at retirement. Experiment 2 demonstrates that this misunderstanding leads to underestimates of the cost of waiting to save, which makes putting off saving more attractive than it should be. Finally, Experiments 3–5 show that highlighting the exponential growth of savings motivates both college students and employees to save more for retirement. Making clear to employees the exponential growth of savings before they make crucial decisions about how much to save may be a simple and effective means of increasing retirement savings.","Craig R.M.

In four studies, participants interacted with realistic computer renderings of their future selves using immersive virtual reality hardware and interactive decision aids.

Normatively, consumers should repay the debt with the highest interest rate most quickly. However, because people tend to break complicated tasks into more manageable parts, and because losses are most distressing when segregated, the authors hypothesize that people will pay off the smallest loan first to reduce the total number of outstanding loans and achieve a sense of tangible progress toward debt repayment. To experimentally examine how consumers manage multiple debts, the authors develop an incentive-compatible debt management game, in which participants are saddled with multiple debts and need to decide how to repay them over time. Consistent with the hypothesis, four experiments reveal evidence of debt account aversion: Participants consistently pay off small debts first, even though the larger debts have higher interest rates. The authors also find that restricting participants’ ability to completely pay off small debts, and focusing their attention on the amount of interest each debt has accumulated, helps them reduce overall debt more quickly.","Moty Amar, Dan Ariely, Shahar Ayal,...","financial decision making, debt repayment, debt consolidation, goals, credit cards",6

Minimum Required Payment and Supplemental Information Disclosure Effects on Consumer Debt Repayment Decisions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.SPL.S60,06-Mar-19,01-Feb-11,48,S,S60,S77,"Repayment decisions—how much of the loan to repay and when to make the payments—directly influence consumer debt levels.

They find that while presenting minimum required payment information has a negative impact on repayment decisions, increasing the minimum required level has a positive effect on repayment for most consumers. Experimental evidence from U.S. consumers shows that consumers’ propensity to pay the minimum required each month moderates these effects; U.K. credit card field data indicate that borrowers’ credit limit and balance due also moderate these effects. However, increasing the minimum level is unlikely to completely eliminate the negative effect of presenting minimum payment information. In addition, disclosing supplemental information, such as future interest cost and time needed to repay the loan, does not reduce the negative effects of including minimum payment information and has no substantial positive effect on repayments.

However, many people strongly dislike paying taxes. Although this distaste could be rational on economic grounds, the authors show that this attitude extends beyond simply disliking the costs incurred and affects behavior in coun-ternormative ways. They demonstrate the phenomenon of tax aversion: a desire to avoid taxes per se that exceeds the rational economic motivation to avoid a monetary cost. Across five experiments, the authors provide evidence that people have a stronger preference to avoid tax-related costs than to avoid equal-sized (or larger) monetary costs unrelated to taxes. Tax aversion affects consumer preferences in a variety of domains, including standard store purchases, financial investments, and job selection. Furthermore, this tendency is most prevalent among people who identify with political parties that generally favor less taxation. Finally, encouraging participants who identify with “antitax” parties to consider positive uses of their tax payments mitigates tax aversion.

Using detailed trade data from two brokers, the authors document that investors are reluctant to repurchase stocks previously sold for a loss and stocks that have risen in price subsequent to a prior sale. The authors propose that this behavior reflects investors’ emotional reactions to trading and their attempts to distance themselves from negative emotions (e.g., disappointment, regret). Investors are disappointed when they sell a stock for a loss and regret having ever purchased the stock; these negative emotions deter investors from later repurchasing stocks they sold for a loss. Having sold a stock, investors are disappointed if the stock continues to rise and regret having sold the stock in the first place; these negative emotions deter investors from repurchasing stocks that go up since being sold. Thus, investors engage in reinforcement learning by repurchasing stocks whose previous purchase resulted in positive emotions and avoiding stocks whose previous purchase resulted in negative emotions.","Michal Ann Strahilevitz, Terrance Odean, Brad M.

The results show that fearful (vs. control) participants sell their stock earlier (Experiments 1–3). This effect, however, is contingent on particular features of the market. Fear leads to early sell-off when parti-pant believe the value of the stock is peer generated but not when they believe the value of the stock is computer generated (Experiment 2). Early sell-off as a result of incidental fear also occurs when participants believe their risk attitude is common in the market but not when they believe their risk attitude is unique (Experiment 3).

Using data from the peer-to-peer lending website Prosper.com, the authors find that unverifiable information affects lending decisions above and beyond the influence of objective, verifiable information. As the number of identity claims in narratives increases, so does loan funding, whereas loan performance suffers, because these borrowers are less likely to pay back the loan. In addition, identity content plays an important role. Identities focused on being trustworthy or successful are associated with increased loan funding but ironically are less predictive of loan performance than other identities (i.e., moral and economic hardship). Thus, some identity claims aim to mislead lenders, whereas others provide true representations of borrowers.","Michal Herzenstein, Scott Sonenshein, Utpal M.

In addition, a series of experiments show that people recognize when they could benefit from a second opinion but are more reluctant to do so when thinking about their own providers rather than someone else's. Further studies test a relationship maintenance hypothesis and show that consumers’ reluctance to seek second opinions is partially driven by their motivation to preserve relationship harmony, even when it is at their own personal expense and well-being.

The proposed method defines a product search network, consisting of the products and links that designate whether a product is searched conditional on searching other products. The authors model this network using a stochastic, hierarchical, and asymmetric multidimensional scaling framework and decompose the product locations as well as the product-level influences using product attributes. The advantages of the approach are twofold. First, the authors simultaneously visualize the positions of products and the direction of consumer search over products in a perceptual map of search proximity. Second, they explain the formation of the map using observed product attributes.

The authors demonstrate that when an individual-level trial hazard model is properly specified to account for potential sources of biases, substantial contagion effects may be detected in the diffusion of many CPGs. Using longitudinal panel data on individual-level trial and repeat purchases of 67 newly introduced CPGs, they show that standard diffusion models fail to detect contagion. However, after extending the model to allow for spatial and temporal heterogeneity in contagion and controlling for various cross-sectional and temporal confounds, they find statistically significant contagion effects in 33 to 40 of the 67 sample products. The empirical evidence of contagion in the diffusion of many CPGs has important implications because most new product trial models for CPGs have assumed a priori that there is no contagion in the diffusion of these products. Moreover, the individual-level simultaneous analysis of the diffusion of 67 newly introduced CPGs provides useful insights into the unobservable network of influences among consumers. Such analysis allows a vendor to identify the most influential early adopters among its customers, who could help diffuse a new product more effectively in the market.","Rex Yuxing Du, Wagner A.

Furthermore, the authors show that when prices increase as a result of an increase in marginal costs, consumers respond by searching more, which then leads to higher prices and instant price adjustment. In contrast, because consumer search activities decline when prices fall, sellers may respond by lowering their prices just enough to dampen consumers’ search tendencies when costs decrease.

From Generic to Branded: A Model of Spillover in Paid Search Advertising,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.1.87,01-Feb-11,01-Feb-11,48,1,87,102,"In Internet paid search advertising, marketers pay for search engines to serve text advertisements in response to keyword searches that are generic (e.g., “hotels”) or branded (e.g., “Hilton Hotels”). Although standalone metrics usually show that generic keywords have higher apparent costs to the advertiser than branded keywords, generic search may create a spillover effect on subsequent branded search. Building on the Nerlove–Arrow advertising framework, the authors propose a dynamic linear model to capture the potential spillover from generic to branded paid search. In the model, generic search advertisements serve to expose users to information about the brand's ability to meet their needs, raising awareness that the brand is relevant to the search. In turn, this can induce additional future search activity for keywords that include the brand name. Using a Bayesian estimation approach, the authors apply the model to data from a paid search campaign for a major lodging chain. The results show that generic search activity positively affects future branded search activity through awareness of relevance. However, branded search does not affect generic search, demonstrating that the spillover is asymmetric.

The authors develop a computer-based self-explicated approach that breaks down the attribute importance question into a ranking of attributes followed by a sequence of constant-sum paired comparison questions. In the proposed approach, the questions are chosen adaptively for each respondent to maximize the information elicited from each paired comparison question. Unlike the traditional self-explicated approach, the proposed approach provides standard errors for attribute importance. In two studies involving digital cameras and laptop computers described on 12 and 14 attributes, respectively, the authors find that the ability to correctly predict validation choices of the proposed adaptive approach is substantially and significantly greater than that of adaptive conjoint analysis, the fast polyhedral method, and the traditional self-explicated approach. In addition, the adaptive self-explicated approach yields a significantly higher predictive validity than a nonadaptive fractional factorial constant-sum paired comparison design.","Oded Netzer, V.

More or Less: A Model and Empirical Evidence on Preferences for Under- and Overpayment in Trade-In Transactions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.1.157,01-Feb-11,01-Feb-11,48,1,157,171,"Trade-in transactions typically involve an exchange of an old, used version for a new or newer version of the product. When consumers trade in their used model for a new model, the firm faces the choice of paying the consumer a relatively low price for the used model and charging a commensurately low price for the new model or paying a relatively high price for the used model and charging a commensurately high price for the new model. The extant literature suggests that consumers always prefer to be overpaid in trade-in transactions because they disproportionately value the gain associated with the revenues from the sale of the used version of the product. The authors draw from the prospect theory value function to develop a simple analytical model that identifies a condition under which this preference for overpayment is reversed. Their model predicts that even when faced with economically equivalent price formats, consumers prefer to be overpaid when the ratio of the price of their used product to the price of the new product is low, but when that ratio is high, the preference for overpayment is reversed. They observe support for the predictions that emerge from the model in laboratory experiments.","Jungkeun Kim, Raghunath Singh Rao, Kyeongheui Kim,...","trade-ins, behavioral decision theory, analytical models, consumer behavior, pricing",3
How Should Consumers’ Willingness to Pay be Measured? An Empirical Comparison of State-of-the-Art Approaches,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.1.172,01-Feb-11,01-Feb-11,48,1,172,184,"This study compares the performance of four commonly used approaches to measure consumers’ willingness to pay with real purchase data (REAL): the open-ended (OE) question format; choice-based conjoint (CBC) analysis; Becker, DeGroot, and Marschak's (BDM) incentive-compatible mechanism; and incentive-aligned choice-based conjoint (ICBC) analysis. With this five-in-one approach, the authors test the relative strengths of the four measurement methods, using REAL as the benchmark, on the basis of statistical criteria and decision-relevant metrics. The results indicate that the BDM and ICBC approaches can pass statistical and decision-oriented tests. The authors find that respondents are more price sensitive in incentive-aligned settings than in non-incentive-aligned settings and the REAL setting. Furthermore, they find a large number of “none” choices under ICBC than under hypothetical conjoint analysis. This study uncovers an intriguing possibility: Even when the OE format and CBC analysis generate hypothetical bias, they may still lead to the right demand curves and right pricing decisions.","Klaus M.

The Influence of Price Discount versus Bonus Pack on the Preference for Virtue and Vice Foods,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.48.1.196,01-Feb-11,01-Feb-11,48,1,196,206,"The authors find that consumers prefer a bonus pack to a price discount for virtue foods but they prefer a price discount to a bonus pack for vice foods. Prior research has shown that, all else being equal, consumers prefer bonus packs to price discounts. The authors propose that this preference does not hold for vice food, because consumers cannot generate good justifications for buying such food when a bonus pack is offered because this would mean consuming more of the vice. However, a price discount on a vice food can be justified because it acts as a guilt-mitigating mechanism. For virtue foods, the absence of both anticipated postconsumption guilt and the resultant need to justify leads consumers to prefer a bonus pack to a price discount. The authors demonstrate the proposed effect and test its underlying process across five experiments.","Arul Mishra, Himanshu Mishra","price discount, bonus pack, guilt, sales promotion, justification",0

Using advertising exposure information for seven of the brands in the study, the authors offer suggestive evidence that ad skipping occurs for a relatively small fraction of the total television content viewed.

What Makes Consumers Willing to Pay a Price Premium for National Brands over Private Labels?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.6.1011,01-Dec-10,01-Dec-10,47,6,1011,1024,"The growing sales of private labels (PLs) pose significant challenges for national brands (NBs) around the world.

Using consumer survey data from 22,623 respondents from 23 countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas across, on average, 63 consumer packaged goods categories per country, this article studies how marketing and manufacturing factors affect the price premium a consumer is willing to pay for an NB over a PL. These effects are mediated by consumer perceptions of the quality of NBs in relation to PLs. Although the results do not bode well for NBs in the sense that willingness to pay decreases as PLs mature, the authors offer several managerial recommendations to counter this trend. In countries in which PLs are more mature, the route to success is to go back to manufacturing basics. In PL development countries, there is a stronger role for marketing to enhance the willingness to pay for NBs.","Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp, Harald J.

Sales Drops from Closing Shops: Assessing the Impact of Store Outlet Closures on Retail Chain Revenue,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.6.1025,01-Dec-10,01-Dec-10,47,6,1025,1040,"Although store closures have become a common feature in grocery retailers’ strategic decisions, knowledge about their implications remains minimal. In this article, the authors study how closure of a particular store affects the chain sales of a multioutlet retailer operating multiple formats. The authors show that the chain sales losses from a closure vary widely across outlets (ranging from less than 30% to more than 80% of the closed outlet's revenue) and depend not only on the closed store's format and distance to competitors but also on the profile of its clientele and type of shopping trip. The authors offer a methodology for predicting the magnitude of these losses for specific store closures that outperforms models calibrated on observed “regular” shopping patterns. This approach offers guidance to retailers in deciding whether a particular store closure is beneficial to the chain or, if the objective is to prune an overly dense network, which of a set of local outlets is the best candidate for closure.","Hans Haans, Els Gijsbrechts","outlet closure, store switching, store formats, sales, survey",0

Using a large-scale longitudinal data set, the authors find that positive changes in customer satisfaction not only improve analyst recommendations but also lower dispersion in those recommendations for the firm. These effects are stronger when product market competition is high and financial market uncertainty is large. In addition, analyst recommendations at least partially mediate the effects of changes in satisfaction on firm abnormal return, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk. Analyst recommendations represent a mechanism through which customer satisfaction affects firm value. Thus, if analysts pay attention to Main Street customer satisfaction, Wall Street investors should have good reason to listen and follow. Overall, this research reveals the impact of satisfaction on analyst-based outcomes and firm value metrics and calls attention to the construct of customer satisfaction as a key intangible asset for the investor community.","Xueming Luo, Christian Homburg, Jan Wieseke","customer satisfaction, financial analysts, competition, marketing–finance interface, stock recommendations, return, risk",6
Making Products Feel Special: When Metacognitive Difficulty Enhances Evaluation,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.6.1059,01-Dec-10,01-Dec-10,47,6,1059,1069,"More than 200 studies suggest that metacognitive difficulty reduces the liking of an object. In contrast to those findings, the authors demonstrate that the effects of metacognitive experiences on evaluation are sensitive to the consumption domain. In the domain of everyday goods, metacognitive difficulty reduces the attractiveness of a product by making it appear unfamiliar. However, in the context of special-occasion products, for which consumers value exclusivity, metacognitive difficulty increases the attractiveness of a product by making it appear unique or uncommon. The authors reconcile their findings with prior research by positing that the effect of metacognitive experiences on evaluation depends on the naive theory people associate with product consumption. Four studies demonstrate the proposed effect and test for the role of lay theories in the interpretation of metacognitive experiences.

This brings up two questions of great managerial importance: Which type of message is generally more effective (category or brand level), and when is one type more effective than the other? The authors pursue these questions by analyzing the effects of advertising on new and refill prescriptions through the use of an augmented Kalman filter with continuous state and discrete observations. The findings suggest the presence of complex dynamics for both types of regulation-induced advertising messages. In general, brand advertising is more effective, especially after competitive entry.

The empirical results suggest that quantity-discount-induced gains or losses have a significant impact on consumer buying behavior. The authors also find a substantial amount of structural heterogeneity; that is, some consumers perceive quantity discounts as gains, whereas others perceive quantity discounts as losses. Conversely, the supply-side analysis suggests that manufacturers in the empirical application do not consider quantity-discount effects when setting prices. Through a series of policy experiments, the authors show that by accounting for quantity-discount-dependent consumer preferences, manufacturers can design more effective nonlinear pricing schemes and obtain greater profits.","Zheyin (Jane) Gu, Sha Yang","quantity-discount effects, perceived gains, perceived losses, nonlinear pricing, transaction utility",0

To test the hypotheses on the influence of serotonin on postconsumption impulsive choice, the authors collected data on the eve of Thanksgiving. The occasion of Thanksgiving dinner provides a naturalistic setting in which people consume a tryptophan-rich meal (tryptophan is a precursor to serotonin).

However, the impact of CMOs on financial performance is highly contingent on the managerial discretion available to them. Focusing on the role of customer power in limiting the managerial discretion available to CMOs, this study identifies individual and firm-specific conditions in which CMOs contribute more or less to firm value.

Consumers with low need for cognition use “the higher, the better” heuristic to select options labeled with ABs and choose brands with higher numeric portions.

A hierarchical Bayes formulation allows for a heterogeneous account of the individual-level adoption likelihood curves as a function of time and common antecedents of technology adoption. A third study generalizes these results among 354 consumer decision makers and, using behavioral data collected during a two-year longitudinal study involving a subsample of 143 consumer decision makers, provides empirical evidence for the accuracy of cumulative adoption likelihood curves for predicting whether and when a technology is adopted. Cumulative adoption likelihood curves outperform two single-intent measures as well as two widely validated intent models in predicting individual-level adoption for a fixed period of two years.

To investigate this issue, the authors apply a multivariate dynamic linear transfer function model to five years of advertising and scanner data for 25 product categories and 70 brands in France. The findings indicate that the total (short-term plus long-term) sales elasticity is 1.37 for product and .74 for distribution. Conversely, the total elasticities for advertising and discounting are only .13 and .04, respectively. This result stands in marked contrast to the previous emphasis in the literature on price promotions and advertising. The authors further find that the long-term effects of discounting are one-third the magnitude of the short-term effects.

Using detailed individual-level prescription data, along with self-reported social network information, the authors document that physician prescription behavior is significantly influenced by the behavior of research-active specialists, or “opinion leaders,” in the physician's reference group. The authors leverage a natural experiment in the category: New guidelines released about the therapeutic nature of the focal drug generated conditions in which physicians were more likely to be influenced by the behavior of specialist physicians in their network. The authors (1) find important, statistically significant peer effects that are robust across model specifications; (2) document asymmetries in response to marketing activity across nominators and opinion leaders; (3) measure the incremental value to firms of directing targeted sales force activity to these opinion leaders; and (4) present estimates of the social multiplier of detailing in this category.","Harikesh S.

Posterior Predictive Model Checking: An Application to Multivariate Normal Heterogeneity,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.5.896,01-Oct-10,01-Oct-10,47,5,896,909,"Analysts fitting a hierarchical Bayesian model must specify the distribution of heterogeneity. There are several distributions to choose from, including the multivariate normal, mixture of normals, Dirichlet processes priors, and so forth. Although significant progress has been made, estimating the models and obtaining measures for model selection remain ongoing areas of research for more flexible distributions of heterogeneity. As a result, the multivariate normal remains the default choice for many researchers and software packages. This article proposes model-checking statistics that signal the adequacy of the multivariate normal assumption for the distribution of heterogeneity; these methods do not require the analyst to fit alternative models. The authors use posterior predictive model checking to determine whether a discrepancy exists between the individual-level parameters and those implied by the assumed distribution of heterogeneity. In simulated and real data sets, the results show that these statistics are useful for identifying when the multivariate normal distribution is adequate, when there is a departure in the tails of the distribution, and when a multimodal distribution of heterogeneity may be more appropriate.","Timothy J.

Shaping Customer Satisfaction through Self-Awareness Cues,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.5.920,01-Oct-10,01-Oct-10,47,5,920,932,"Six studies show that subtle contextual cues that increase customers’ self-awareness can be used to influence their satisfaction with service providers (while holding the objective service delivery constant). Self-awareness cues tend to increase customers’ satisfaction when the outcome of a service interaction is unfavorable, but they tend to decrease customers’ satisfaction when the outcome of the interaction is favorable. This is because higher self-awareness increases customers’ tendency to attribute outcomes to themselves rather than to the provider. Self-awareness can even influence satisfaction with service interactions that occurred far in the past. The authors demonstrate these effects across a variety of lab and field settings with different simulated retail experiences and with different real-life service interactions, including college courses, meals taken at a university cafeteria, and items purchased at an actual clothing store. The results further show that attempts to shape customers’ satisfaction by means of self-awareness are more likely to be effective when there is substantial customer responsibility for the outcome; when customers’ responsibility is limited, such attempts may backfire.","Michel Tuan Pham, Caroline Goukens, Donald R.

Thus, orientation matching results in emotional benefit, increases preferences toward matched outcomes, and frees resources for subsequent tasks.","Aparna A. Labroo, Derek D.

Myopic management is contrasted with accounting accruals-based earnings inflation, and the author shows that the real activities (i.e., myopic management), and not the accounting numbers manipulation, have the greater negative impact on future financial performance.

Customer Satisfaction Heterogeneity and Shareholder Value,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.4.612,01-Aug-10,01-Aug-10,47,4,612,626,"It is widely recognized that business growth and shareholder value are engineered on the basis of investments aimed at acquiring and retaining customers. Along with this premise, however, the literature reveals a growing recognition that the manner in which important customer-based outcomes are constructed in the short term has vital implications for long-term firm performance. Adopting the view that customer satisfaction is a stochastic marketplace asset, the authors advance a mean-variance perspective that enables them to test two conjectures: (1) Objective service quality and advertising affect not only the level of customer satisfaction but also the heterogeneity in customer satisfaction, and (2) shareholder value is shaped by the interplay of satisfaction level and heterogeneity, through their impact on retention sales, acquisition sales, and servicing costs. The authors test these conjectures using secondary data from diverse sources that describe the dynamics in the U.S. airlines industry during a nine-year period (1997–2005). The results, derived from estimating structural models that account for the impact of several meaningful control variables, provide strong support for both conjectures. Importantly, the findings indicate that the return on satisfaction to shareholder value decreases by almost 70% in going from low to high satisfaction heterogeneity; at the same time, increasing levels of satisfaction heterogeneity serves to reduce the volatility in shareholder value.","Rajdeep Grewal, Murali Chandrashekaran, Alka V.

This research investigates how data on prior advertising expenditures and sales outcomes are used in budget allocation decisions and attempts to answer three important questions about data-based inferences. First, do biases exist that are strong enough to lead to seriously suboptimal decisions? Second, do graphical data displays, real-world experience, or explicit training reduce any observed biases? Third, are the observed biases well explained by a relatively small set of natural heuristics that managers use when making data-based allocation decisions? The results suggest answers of yes, no, and yes, respectively. The authors identify three broad classes of heuristics: difference-based (which assess causation by comparing adjacent changes in expenditures to changes in sales), trend-based (which assess causation by comparing overall trends in expenditures and sales), and exemplar-based (which emulate the allocation pattern of the observations with the highest sales). All three heuristics create biases in some situations. Overall, exemplar-based heuristics were used most frequently and induced the greatest biasing of the three (sometimes allocating the most to an advertising medium that was uncorrelated with sales). Difference-based heuristics were used less frequently but generated the most extreme allocations. Trend-based heuristics were used the least.","J. Wesley Hutchinson, Joseph W. Alba, Eric M.

Determining Influential Users in Internet Social Networks,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.4.643,01-Aug-10,01-Aug-10,47,4,643,658,"The success of Internet social networking sites depends on the number and activity levels of their user members. Although users typically have numerous connections to other site members (i.e., “friends”), only a fraction of those so-called friends may actually influence a member's site usage. Because the influence of potentially hundreds of friends needs to be evaluated for each user, inferring precisely who is influential—and, therefore, of managerial interest for advertising targeting and retention efforts—is difficult. The authors develop an approach to determine which users have significant effects on the activities of others using the longitudinal records of members' log-in activity. They propose a nonstandard form of Bayesian shrinkage implemented in a Poisson regression. Instead of shrinking across panelists, strength is pooled across variables within the model for each user. The approach identifies the specific users who most influence others' activity and does so considerably better than simpler alternatives. For the social networking site data, the authors find that, on average, approximately one-fifth of a user's friends actually influence his or her activity level on the site.","Michael Trusov, Anand V.

Consumers previously exposed to broad assortments or categorizations base their decisions on fewer pieces of information, typically those made salient by the environment. In contrast, consumers previously exposed to narrow assortments or categorizations employ multiple pieces of information, both salient and nonsalient, without exerting any extra effort. Consequently, prior exposure to broad versus narrow categorizations leads to greater susceptibility to some common context effects and to heuristic decision making.","Gülden Ülkümen, Amitav Chakravarti, Vicki G.

Mind-Set Metrics in Market Response Models: An Integrative Approach,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.4.672,01-Aug-10,01-Aug-10,47,4,672,684,"Demonstrations of marketing effectiveness currently proceed along two parallel tracks: Quantitative researchers model the direct sales effects of the marketing mix, and advertising and branding experts trace customer mind-set metrics (e.g., awareness, affect).

Vector autoregressive modeling of the metrics for more than 60 brands of four consumer goods shows that advertising awareness, brand consideration, and brand liking account for almost one-third of explained sales variance. Competitive and own mind-set metrics make a similar contribution. Wear-in times reveal that mind-set metrics can be used as advance warning signals that allow enough time for managerial action before market performance itself is affected. Specific marketing actions affect specific mind-set metrics, with the strongest overall impact for distribution.

Measuring Consumer Preferences for Complex Products: A Compositional Approach BasedonPaired Comparisons,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.4.685,02-Oct-18,01-Aug-10,47,4,685,698,"Conjoint analysis has become a widely accepted tool for preference measurement in marketing research, though its applicability and performance strongly depend on the complexity of the product or service. Therefore, self-explicated approaches are still frequently used because of their simple design, which facilitates preference elicitation when large numbers of attributes need to be considered. However, the direct measurement of preferences, or rather utilities, has been criticized as being imprecise in many cases. Against this background, the authors present a compositional consumer preference measurement approach based on paired comparisons, otherwise known as PCPM. The trade-off character of paired comparisons ensures that the stated judgments are more intuitive than traditional self-explicated preference statements. In contrast to the latter, PCPM accounts for response errors and thus allows for the elicitation of more precise preferences. The authors benchmark PCPM against adaptive conjoint analysis and computer-assisted self-explication of multiattributed preferences to demonstrate its relative validity and predictive accuracy in two empirical studies using complex, high-involvement products. They find that PCPM yields better results than the benchmark approaches with respect to interview length, individual hit rates, and aggregate choice share predictions.","Sören W.

A Comparative Study on Parameter Recovery of Three Approaches to Structural Equation Modeling,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.4.699,02-Oct-18,01-Aug-10,47,4,699,712,"Traditionally, two approaches have been employed for structural equation modeling: covariance structure analysis and partial least squares. A third alternative, generalized structured component analysis, was introduced recently in the psychometric literature. The authors conduct a simulation study to evaluate the relative performance of these three approaches in terms of parameter recovery under different experimental conditions of sample size, data distribution, and model specification. In this study, model specification is the only meaningful condition in differentiating the performance of the three approaches in parameter recovery. Specifically, when the model is correctly specified, covariance structure analysis tends to recover parameters better than the other two approaches. Conversely, when the model is misspecified, generalized structured component analysis tends to recover parameters better. Finally, partial least squares exhibits inferior performance in parameter recovery compared with the other approaches. In particular, this tendency is salient when the model involves cross-loadings. Thus, generalized structured component analysis may be a good alternative to partial least squares for structural equation modeling and is recommended over covariance structure analysis unless correct model specification is ensured.","Heungsun Hwang, Naresh K.

For example, consumers choose a greater quantity when flavor (or brand) decisions precede, rather than follow, size decisions. The authors find that the degree of attribute replaceability also moderates the effect of decision order on quantity chosen. Furthermore, marketers can influence the amount chosen by altering the organization of the shelf display. Finally, the authors find that when consumers explicitly consider the possibility of deferring their decisions, the effect of decision order declines.","Stephen M.

This intriguing retailing format appears in an increasing number of large department stores worldwide. The authors use a theoretical model to investigate the economic incentives a retailer faces when deciding on this arrangement. The retailer's trade-off is between channel efficiency and interbrand competition, moderated by returns to in-store service and increased store traffic. The retailer cannot credibly commit to the retail prices and service levels that the manufacturers effect in an integrated channel, so it decides instead to allow them to set up stores within its store. Thus, the stores-within-a-store phenomenon emerges when a powerful retailer, ironically, gives manufacturers autonomy in its retail space.

Such controls may be especially tempting given the findings that favorable salesperson product perceptions actually yield less effort on the new product, and behavior-based controls can offset this tendency. However, using longitudinal data from a sample of 226 salespeople, along with external ratings from customers and archival measures of effort and sales performance, the authors demonstrate that such a strategy is shortsighted. Behavior-based controls constrain a salesperson's ability to appropriately allocate effort across his or her customer base, negatively affecting customer product perceptions and, ultimately, new product sales. In contrast, outcome-based control systems enable salespeople to work smarter, and their corresponding effort on behalf of the new product has a more positive effect on customer product perceptions and new product sales.","Michael Ahearne, Adam Rapp, Douglas E.

Social Loss Aversion and Optimal Contest Design,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.4.777,01-Aug-10,01-Aug-10,47,4,777,787,"When managers are designing a contest to motivate effort by salespeople, service employees, franchisees, or product development teams, a key question is, What should the optimal proportion of winners and losers be? Prevailing marketing theory predicts that the proportion of winners in a contest should always be lower than the proportion of losers. Not only has this theory not been empirically tested, but it is also based on the assumption that contestants care solely about the value of the prizes they receive. This self-interested assumption has been increasingly challenged in marketing and economics. This article uses a behavioral economics model to formalize the idea that if contestants also care about their contest outcomes relative to other contestants, changing the proportion of winners in a contest can alter the reference points contestants use to make these social comparisons. Consequently, a contest with a higher proportion of winners than losers can yield greater effort than one with fewer winners than losers if the degree of social loss aversion in the contestants is sufficiently strong. Two incentive-aligned experiments show that this prediction can be valid in situations with public announcements of contest outcomes.",Noah Lim,"contests, sales management, loss aversion, behavioral economics, experimental economics",0
Raising the BAR: Bias Adjustment of Recognition Tests in Advertising,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.3.387,01-Jun-10,01-Jun-10,47,3,387,400,"Advertising recognition tests use advertisements as visual retrieval cues; they require consumers to report which advertisements they remember having seen earlier and whether they noticed the advertised brand and read most of the text at the time. Using a heterogeneous randomly stopped sum model, the authors establish the relationship between consumers' actual attention to print advertisements, as measured through eye tracking, and subsequent ad recognition measures. They find that ad recognition measures are systematically biased because consumers infer prior attention from the ad layout and their familiarity with the brands in the advertisements. Such biases undermine the validity of recognition tests for advertising practice and theory development. The authors quantify the positive and negative diagnostic value of ad recognition for prior attention and demonstrate how these diagnostic values can be used to develop bias-adjusted recognition (BAR) scores that more accurately reflect prior attention.

The authors examine the newly proposed ticket pricing mechanism in sports markets, in which there is uncertainty about the teams that will play in a final event (e.g., the National Collegiate Athletic Association Final Four basketball tournament). Fans who want to attend the game after knowing which teams will play are often disappointed because tickets typically sell out in advance. The authors propose that a fan can buy an option on a ticket before this uncertainty is resolved. Later, he or she can decide whether to exercise the option. The authors present a simple analytical model of consumer options in this setting. Then, they empirically demonstrate that profits under option pricing can exceed those from (1) advance selling and (2) pricing after uncertainty is resolved.

The authors study the pricing and new product introduction decisions of firms in the personal computer industry. Consistent with prior research, the authors find that firms mutually forbear in price and new product introductions.

Dynamics of Pricing in the Video Game Console Market: Skimming or Penetration?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.3.428,01-Jun-10,01-Jun-10,47,3,428,443,"Nintendo lost its dominant position in the video game industry during the console war between its Nintendo 64 and Sony's PlayStation. However, Nintendo could have made several different strategic decisions to change the outcome. This article develops a structural model and investigates these alternative strategies through policy simulations. In particular, the author provides a framework to study firms' optimal pricing strategies under network effects, consumer heterogeneity, and oligopolistic competition. Consumer heterogeneity provides an incentive for a durable goods manufacturer to price skim, while network effects lead to an opposite motive for penetration pricing. The proposed framework incorporates these two competing motives under oligopolistic competition. The author estimates a demand system that allows for indirect network effects and consumer heterogeneity and then numerically solves for the Markov perfect equilibrium in firms' dynamic pricing game. Policy simulations indicate that Nintendo could have won the console war either with 10% more games or with a “head start” of one million units in installed base at the time of the PlayStation introduction.",Hongju Liu,"price skimming, penetration pricing, policy simulation, indirect network effect, dynamic programming",3
Forecasting Marketing-Mix Responsiveness for New Products,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.3.444,01-Jun-10,01-Jun-10,47,3,444,457,"Before a new product launch, marketers need to infer how demand will respond to various levels of marketing-mix variables to set an appropriate marketing plan. A critical challenge in estimating marketing-mix responsiveness from historical data is that the observed decisions were affected by private information possessed by managers about the heterogeneous effects of marketing-mix variables on sales. The authors refer to this as the “slope endogeneity” problem. Such endogeneity differs from the “intercept endogeneity” problem, which has been widely acknowledged in the literature. To correct for the slope endogeneity bias, the authors develop a conceptually simple control function approach that is amenable to multiple endogenous variables and marketing-mix carryover effects. The method is applied to forecasting advertising responsiveness in the U.S. DVD market. The results suggest that advertising responsiveness varies substantially across DVD titles and that estimated marketing-mix elasticities would be biased if the slope endogeneity problem were ignored. This analysis also yields findings of substantive interest to researchers and managers involved in entertainment marketing.","Y. Jackie Luan, K.

Using survey and archival data from a sample of 185 pharmaceutical sales teams, the authors find that high team consensus regarding team-level leadership empowerment behaviors (LEBs) and team interpersonal climate quality enhances team potency given high LEBs but weakens team potency given low LEBs. In turn, team potency translates into sales team performance through both extra-role (team helping behavior) and in-role (team effort) behavior.

Modeling the Intrahousehold Behavioral Interaction,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.3.470,10-Oct-18,01-Jun-10,47,3,470,484,"Quantitative models in marketing typically focus on the household as the unit of analysis while ignoring the individual family members' behavior and the behavioral interactions among household members. However, knowledge of such intrahousehold behavioral interaction enables marketers to target their communications more effectively. In this article, the authors propose a modeling framework to capture the intrahousehold behavioral interaction based on family members' actual consumption behavior over time. The authors develop a model to capture multiple agents' (more than two individuals') simultaneous choice decisions over more than two choice alternatives. This is extremely difficult with other previously developed modeling approaches. The authors apply the proposed model to a context of family members' television viewing and simultaneously model whether the television is on, which type of program is playing, and which family members are watching. The proposed model makes it possible to estimate the individual's intrinsic preference and the extrinsic preference from a joint consumption with other members. In turn, these estimates enable the authors to test several alternative group decision-making heuristics that may operate in those joint consumption occasions and to conduct managerially useful counterfactual simulations.","Sha Yang, Yi Zhao, Tülin Erdem,...","autologistic choice model, joint consumption, behavioral interaction, family-member decision making, hierarchical Bayesian analysis",0

When Choosing Makes a Good Thing Better: Temporal Variations in the Valuation of Hedonic Consumption,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.3.497,01-Jun-10,01-Jun-10,47,3,497,507,"This research investigates how the valuation of delayed consumption of hedonic products, such as concerts and chocolate, varies with the passage of time between choice and consumption. The authors find that when consumers make their own choices, they exhibit increases in evaluations of delayed consumption, but only if the interval between choice and consumption is relatively short. The effect attenuates over longer periods, resulting in an inverted U-shaped relationship between evaluations and time. In contrast, when somebody else chooses the same option for the consumer, evaluations decrease with the passage of time. These effects depend on the extent of intrinsic motivation toward the object of consumption and occur only for consummatory consumption that is of inherent interest. Moreover, anticipatory increases in evaluations before consumption have ironic negative effects on postconsumption evaluations.

The underlying process for both outcomes is a recency effect, such that there is better recall for the most recently sampled experiential product. The recency effect observed for experiential products reverses to a primacy effect when sampling nonexperiential products (e.g., scissors). The authors also demonstrate that the placement of an undesirable experiential product in conjunction with two desirable experiential products can exaggerate preference for the later-sampled desirable product (when the undesirable product is sampled first) or result in preference for the earlier-sampled desirable product (when the undesirable product is sampled between the two desirable products). However, the preference for the earlier-sampled desirable product holds only if there is no time delay between the sampling of the products or between the sampling and the choice evaluations.","Dipayan Biswas, Dhruv Grewal, Anne Roggeveen","experiential products, sampling, order effects, choice behavior, mixed choice set",0

Initial forays into this area suggest that the depletion of self-regulatory resources is irrelevant when advertisement arguments are strong or consumers are highly motivated to process. In contrast to these conclusions, the authors contend that depletion has important but previously hidden effects in such contexts. That is, although attitudes are equivalent in valence and extremity, consumers are more certain of their attitudes when they form them under conditions of depletion than nondepletion. The authors propose that this effect occurs because feeling depleted induces the perception of having engaged in thorough information processing. As a consequence of greater attitude certainty, depleted consumers' attitudes exert greater influence on their purchase behavior. Three experiments, using different products and ad exposure times, confirm these hypotheses. Experiment 3 demonstrates the potential to vary consumers' naive beliefs about the relationship between depletion and thoroughness of processing, and this variation moderates the effect of depletion on attitude certainty. The authors discuss the theoretical contributions and implications for marketing.","Echo Wen Wan, Derek D. Rucker, Zakary L.

The authors show that the framing of the savings message on sales promotions (e.g., “Save $x” versus “Get $x Off”), the expiration date restriction cue (immediate versus future expiration), and the familiarity of brands (well-known versus less familiar) are independent primes of regulatory focus. Furthermore, such cues, when compatible with one another or with a prior regulatory focus, lead to more unrelated purchases in the store.

However, high uniqueness does not decrease willingness to generate WOM for privately consumed products (Study 1). Study 2 demonstrates that for publicly consumed products, WOM that includes positive recommendations is more persuasive than WOM that only contains product details. Consequently, the effect of uniqueness is more pronounced for WOM recommendations than for WOM that only provides details (Study 3). Study 4 confirms that high- (versus low-) uniqueness consumers are less willing to recommend a public product to others but are equally willing to discuss product details.

The collectivist perspective orients consumers toward the in-group and heightens concerns about “face” (i.e., status earned in a social network) that arise from in-group comparisons. Process evidence for the causal role of cultural differences derives from manipulated self-construal and measurement of the emotional role of shame evoked by face concerns.

This article examines the economic value implications of a social network between sellers in a large online social commerce marketplace. In this marketplace, each seller creates his or her own shop, and network ties between sellers are directed hyperlinks between their shops. Three questions are addressed: (1) Does allowing sellers to connect to each other create value (i.e., increase sales)? (2) What are the mechanisms through which this value is created? and (3) How is this value distributed across sellers in the network and how does the position of a seller in the network (e.g., its centrality) influence how much he or she benefits or suffers from the network? The authors find that (1) allowing sellers to connect generates considerable economic value, (2) the network's value lies primarily in making shops more accessible to customers browsing the marketplace (the network creates a “virtual shopping mall”), and (3) the sellers who benefit the most from the network are not necessarily those who are central to the network but rather those whose accessibility is most enhanced by the network.","Andrew T.

A comparable group of customers in a neighboring state serves as a control. The results show that Internet sales decrease significantly, but catalog sales are unaffected. Further investigation indicates that the difference in these outcomes is partly attributable to the ease with which customers can search for lower prices at competing retailers.

In contrast, people who believe either that self-control is a large resource (“unlimited theorists”) or that it cannot increase over time (“fixed theorists”) are less likely to engage in such behaviors. Field experiments conducted with parents demonstrate that limited-malleable theorists take their children less frequently to fast-food restaurants, give their children unhealthful snacks less often, and prefer educational to entertaining television programs for them. Similar patterns are observed when nonparent adults make gift choices for children or while babysitting.

Compatible appeals (i.e., appeals that elicit the same emotion as being incidentally experienced by the consumer) are less effective in influencing behavioral intentions and beverage consumption because of a process in which consumers discount the notion that they may cause the negative consequences outlined in the message.

As assortment sizes increase, so do consumers’ expectations of the degree of preference match they can achieve. Subsequently, consumers may experience greater negative expectation disconfirmation or less positive expectation disconfirmation when a chosen item comes from a larger rather than a smaller set.

In Studies 2 and 3, the IAT effect changes its sign when the order of the blocks reverses. Cognitive inertia distorts individual IAT scores and diminishes the correlations between IAT scores and predictor variables when the block order is counterbalanced between subjects. Study 4 shows that counterbalancing the block order repeatedly within subjects can eliminate cognitive inertia effects on the individual level.

A Control Function Approach to Endogeneity in Consumer Choice Models,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.1.3,01-Feb-10,01-Feb-10,47,1,3,13,"Endogeneity arises for numerous reasons in models of consumer choice. It leads to inconsistency with standard estimation methods that maintain independence between the model's error and the included variables. The authors describe a control function approach for handling endogeneity in choice models. Observed variables and economic theory are used to derive controls for the dependence between the endogenous variable and the demand error. The theory points to the relationships that contain information on the unobserved demand factor, such as the pricing equation and the advertising equation. The authors’ approach is an alternative to Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes's (1995) product-market controls for unobserved quality. The authors apply both methods to examine households’ choices among television options, including basic and premium cable packages, in which unobserved attributes, such as quality of programming, are expected to be correlated with price. Without correcting for endogeneity, aggregate demand is estimated to be upward-sloping, suggesting that omitted attributes are positively correlated with demand. Both the control function method and the product-market controls method produce downward-sloping demand estimates that are similar.","Amil Petrin, Kenneth Train","customer choice, endogeneity, advertising, price effects, econometric models",7
Reducing Social Desirability Bias through Item Randomized Response: An Application to Measure Underreported Desires,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.1.14,01-Feb-10,01-Feb-10,47,1,14,27,"The authors present a polytomous item randomized response model to measure socially sensitive consumer behavior. It complements established methods in marketing to correct for social desirability bias a posteriori and traditional randomized response models to prevent social desirability bias a priori. The model allows for individual-level inferences at the construct level while protecting the privacy of respondents at the item level. In addition, it is possible to incorporate covariates in to various parts of the model. The proposed method is especially useful to study social issues in marketing. In the empirical application, the authors use a two-group experimental survey design and find that with the new procedure, participants report their sensitive desires more truthfully, with significant differences between socioeconomic groups. In addition, the method performs better than methods based on social desirability scales. Finally, the authors discuss truthfulness in data collection and confidentiality in data utilization.","Martijn G.

The Effect of Customer Satisfaction on Consumer Spending Growth,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.1.28,01-Feb-10,01-Feb-10,47,1,28,35,"Predicting aggregate consumer spending is vitally important to marketing planning, yet traditional economic theory holds that predicting changes in aggregate consumer spending is not possible. Previous attempts to predict consumer spending growth using standard macroeconomic predictor variables have met with little success. The authors show that the lagged change in customer satisfaction, which contributes to future demand, has a significant impact on spending growth. However, this impact is moderated by increases in consumers’ debt service ratio, a key budget constraint that affects consumers’ ability to spend. Using an asymmetric growth model, more than 23% of the variation in the one-quarter-ahead spending growth is explained, which represents a notable improvement over prior specifications.","Claes Fornell, Roland T.

Ties that Bind: The Impact of Multiple Types of Ties with a Customeron Sales Growth and Sales Volatility,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.1.36,01-Feb-10,01-Feb-10,47,1,36,50,"Suppliers in business-to-business settings are increasingly building a portfolio of multiple types of ties with individual customers. For example, in addition to supplying goods and services, a supplier may have a research-and-development alliance and a marketing alliance with a customer. This study investigates the effect of multiple types of ties with a customer on a supplier's performance with the customer. The findings from panel data on supplier–customer relationships suggest that an increase in the number of different types of ties with a customer results in an increase in supplier sales to the customer and a decrease in sales volatility to that customer. The effect of a change in relationship multiplexity (i.e., number of different types of ties) on the change in sales becomes weaker and its effect on the change in sales volatility becomes stronger as the competitive intensity in the customer's industry increases. The results also indicate that the effect of a change in the number of different types of ties on the change in sales volatility becomes stronger when the intangibles intensity in a customer's industry increases. The results are robust to alternative measures, alternative estimators, heteroskedasticity, and endogeneity, among other methodological concerns. These findings have clear implications for managing multiple types of ties with a customer and indicate that relationship multiplexity is a valuable nonfinancial metric.","Kapil R. Tuli, Sundar G.

The Impact of Product Line Extensions and Consumer Goalson the Formation of Price Image,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.1.51,01-Feb-10,01-Feb-10,47,1,51,62,"How do vertical product line extensions influence a retailer’ sprice image? Conventional wisdom suggests that adding an upscale or downscale item to a product line has a directionally consistent impact on price image, such that upscale extensions increase price image and downscale extensions decrease price image. In contrast, this research argues that vertical extensions can have the opposite effect, such that upscale extensions can decrease rather than increase price image, and vice versa for downscale extensions. The authors further propose that the impact of vertical extensions on price image is a function of consumer goals and, in particular, whether consumers have the intent of browsing or buying.

An important goal of this study is to establish the validity of the existing practice to infer consideration sets from observed choices in panel data. The authors show with experimental data that underlying consideration sets can be reliably retrieved from choice data alone and that consideration is positively affected by display and shelf space. Next, the model is applied to Information Resources Inc. panel data. The findings suggest that promotion effects are larger when they are included in the consideration stage of the two-stage model than in a single-stage model.

Spatiotemporal Analysis of Imitation Behavior across New Buyers at an Online Grocery Retailer,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.1.75,01-Feb-10,01-Feb-10,47,1,75,89,"For Internet retailers, demand propagation varies not only through time but also over space. The authors develop a Bayesian spatiotemporal model to study two imitation effects in the evolution of demand at an Internet retailer. Building on previous literature, the authors allow imitation behavior to be reflected both in geographic proximity and in demographic similarity. As these imitation effects can be time varying, the authors specify their dynamics using a “polynomial smoother” embedded within the Bayesian framework. They apply the model to new buyers at Netgrocer. com and calibrate it on 45 months of data that span all 1459 zip codes in Pennsylvania. The authors find that the proximity effect is especially strong in the early phases of demand evolution, whereas the similarity effect becomes more important with time. Over time, new buyers are increasingly likely to emerge from new zip codes beyond the “core set” of zip codes that produce the early new buyers, and spatial concentration declines. The authors explore the managerial implications stemming from these findings through a hypothetical “seeding” experiment.

Forward Buying by Retailers,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.1.90,01-Feb-10,01-Feb-10,47,1,90,102,"Conventional wisdom in marketing holds that (1) retailer forward buying is a consequence of manufacturer trade promotions and (2) stockpiling units helps the retailer but hurts the manufacturer. This article provides a deeper understanding of forward buying by analyzing it within the context of manufacturer trade promotions, competition, and demand uncertainty. The authors find that regardless of whether the manufacturer offers a trade promotion, allowing the retailer to forward buy and hold inventory for the future can, under certain conditions, be beneficial for both parties. Disallowing forward buying by the retailer may lead the manufacturer to lower merchandising requirements and change the depth of the promotion. In competitive environments, there are situations in which retailers engage in forward buying because of competitive pressures in a prisoner's-dilemma situation. Finally, when the authors consider the case of uncertain demand, they find further evidence of strategic forward buying. In particular, the authors find cases in which the retailer orders a quantity that is higher than what it expects to sell in even the most optimistic demand scenario.","Preyas S.

Patient-or Physician-Oriented Marketing: What Drives Primary Demand for Prescription Drugs?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.1.103,01-Feb-10,01-Feb-10,47,1,103,121,"The authors analyze primary demand effects of marketing efforts directed at the physician (detailing and professional journal advertising) versus marketing efforts directed at the patient (direct-to-consumer advertising). The analysis covers 86 categories, or approximately 85% of the U.S. pharmaceutical market, during the 2001–2005 period. Primary demand effects are rather small, in contrast with the estimated sales effects for individual brands. By using a new brand-level method to estimate primary demand effects with aggregate data, the authors show that the small effects are due to intense competitive interactions during the observation period but not necessarily to low primary demand responsiveness. In contrast with previous studies, the authors also find that detailing is more effective in driving primary demand than direct-to-consumer advertising. A category sales model cannot provide such insights. In addition, a category sales model likely produces biased predictions about period-by-period changes in primary demand. The suggested brand-level method does not suffer from these limitations.","Marc Fischer, Sönke Albers","primary demand effects, marketing-mix effects, econometric models, pharmaceutical marketing",0

Furthermore, the implicit attitude has more influential consequences than the explicit attitude, highlighting the possible subtle impact of flattery even when a person has consciously corrected for it. The authors also clarify the underlying process by showing how and why the discrepancy between the implicit and explicit attitudes induced by flattery may be reduced.

Effects of Indirectly and Directly Competing Reference Group Messages and Persuasion Knowledge: Implications for Educational Placements,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.47.1.134,01-Feb-10,01-Feb-10,47,1,134,145,"Educational placements increasingly appear to replace public service announcements as a means of communication, but their efficacy seems questionable because they contain mixed messages. Two experiments, conducted with 2850 adolescents, test versions of a real television program with an antismoking educational placement against a control program. Typical antismoking programs contain three indirectly competing messages: Smokers are attractive and prevalent but also worthy of disapproval. Experiment 1 tests several program versions with these three messages and reveals that the disapproval message dominates and elicits negative smoker thoughts and beliefs, despite the otherwise potent smoker attractiveness message. Experiment 2 indicates corresponding effects for intent but shows that adding a directly competitive smoker approval message nullifies this effect. Furthermore, Experiment 2 tests an educational epilogue designed to reinforce the disapproval message, but this message instead induces boomerang effects among smokers. That is, among smokers, an educational placement is counterattitudinal, so when the epilogue discloses the placement and evokes persuasion knowledge, smokers generate more positive smoker beliefs and intentions.

First, informative advertising can lead to lower prices if consumer valuations are high. However, if consumer valuations are low, informative advertising can lead to higher prices. Second, when consumer valuations are high, price increases with greater diversity in tastes, though this result reverses if consumer valuations are low.

By imposing a bilinear parameter structure on a multinomial logit model, the authors graphically distinguish the effects on the response behavior of the characteristics of a respondent and the content of an item. The authors combine this approach with finite mixture modeling, yielding two segmentations of the respondents: one for response style and one for item content. They apply this latent-class bilinear multinomial logit model to the well-known List of Values in a cross-national context. The results show large differences in the opinions and the response styles of respondents and reveal previously unknown response styles. Some response styles appear to be valid communication styles, whereas other response styles often concur with inconsistent opinions of the items and seem to be response bias.","Joost Van Rosmalen, Hester Van Herk, Patrick J.F.

The proposed model provides managers with a valuable tool to evaluate their allocation of marketing expenditures over time. An application of the model to many pharmaceutical products, estimated through (exact initial) Kalman filtering, indicates that both persistent and transient effects occur predominantly immediately after a brand's introduction. Subsequently, the size of the effects declines. The authors theoretically and empirically compare their methodology with methodology based on unit root testing and demonstrate that the need for unit root tests creates difficulties in applying conventional persistence modeling.

The “heavier” (“lighter”) locations are on the bottom (top), right (left), and bottom-right (top-left) of the package. For products for which heaviness is considered a positive attribute, packages with the product image placed at heavy locations are preferred, whereas for products for which heaviness is considered a negative attribute, packages using light locations are preferred. Furthermore, in the former category (e.g., snacks), a salient health goal, as opposed to a neutral goal, weakens the preference for packages using heavy locations, though this moderating effect of goal is weaker for healthful snacks than for regular snacks. Store shelf context is a boundary condition, such that the location effects on perceived product heaviness and package evaluation appear in a contrasting context but disappear in an assimilating context. Moreover, perceived product heaviness mediates (1) the location effect on package evaluation and (2) the moderating role of store shelf context (i.e., mediated moderation).","Xiaoyan Deng, Barbara E.

In three laboratory experiments and two field studies, the authors find that changes in size appear smaller when packages and portions change in all three spatial dimensions—height, width, and length—than when they change in only one dimension. Specifically, they show that size estimations follow an inelastic power function of the actual size of the product, especially when all three spatial dimensions change simultaneously. As a result, consumers are more likely to supersize their orders when products change in one dimension and are more likely to downsize their orders when products change in three dimensions. When changing dosage, consumers pour more product into and out of conical containers (e.g., martini cocktail glasses, in which volume changes in three dimensions) than cylindrical containers (e.g., highball glasses, in which volume changes in one dimension).

In addition, the by-attribute customization procedure leads to a lower level of experienced difficulty greater satisfaction, and higher willingness to purchase the customized option than the by-alternative method. Finally the decrease in experienced difficulty in the by-attribute customization method is not solely due to the reduction in information consideration but also due to less explicit trade-offs among competing characteristics.

Retention of the benefits leader is evidenced by the distortion of new information to favor the benefits leader and by greater-than-normative reversion to it. The authors also find that reversion does not occur when the initially leading product (that consumers switch from) is based on a cost savings.

This relationship between closeness and participation is intriguing because (1) it implies that people participate in elections because their vote might be decisive, but (2) such an incentive to vote is unreasonable. This study presents a theoretical model that suggests that closeness does not affect the turnout rate directly but rather through the marketing activities of the parties. In other words, in equilibrium, close elections attract higher marketing spending, which in turn increases turnout. The author uses data on the 1996–2004 presidential elections in the United States to examine the model and its implications. Using structural (and nonstructural) estimation, the author finds that the data support the model and its implications. Furthermore, the effect of marketing on turnout is dramatic.

Statistical Benefits of Choices from Subsets,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.6.816_JMR6I,01-Dec-09,01-Dec-09,46,6,816,831,"Marketers often analyze multinomial choice from a set of branded products to learn about demand. Given a set of brands to study, the authors analyze three reasons why choices from strict subsets of the brands can contain more statistical information about demand than choices from all the brands in the study: First, making choices from smaller subsets is easier, so it is possible to use more choice tasks when the choice data come from a choice-based conjoint survey. Second, choices from subsets of brands better identify and more accurately estimate the covariance structure of unobserved utility shocks associated with brands. Third, subsets automatically balance the brand shares when some of the brands are less popular than others. The authors demonstrate these three benefits of subsets using a mixture of analytical results and numerical simulations and provide implications for the design of choice-based conjoint analyses. They find that the optimal subset size depends on the model, the number of brands in the study and the designer's resource constraint. In addition to showing that subsets can be beneficial, this article provides a simulation methodology that helps designers pick the best subset size for their setting.","Robert Zeithammer, Peter Lenk","choice models, conjoint, experiment design, choice set, probit",0

Second, the authors investigate the impact of priors for the covariance of parameter heterogeneity when the predictor variables are qualitative. Estimates of the omitted effects are spurious with the standard prior. The authors propose an effects prior that treats all effects symmetrically. Third, the authors consider willingness to pay.

Despite a substantial interdisciplinary literature reporting a weak relationship between customers' perceptions of service and their tipping behavior, the results show that a policy of voluntary tipping has positive effects on the motivation and behavior of service workers and on customers' perceptions of the service those workers provide. These findings call attention to buyer monitoring as both a topic for academic research and a practical mechanism for motivating service employees.

Learning from a Service Guarantee Quasi Experiment,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.5.584,01-Oct-09,01-Oct-09,46,5,584,596,"The authors analyze data from a service guarantee program implemented by a midpriced hotel chain. Using a multisite regression discontinuity quasi-experimental design developed over 16 months, they control for unobserved heterogeneity among guests and treatments across hotels and develop Bayesian posterior estimates of the varying program effect for each hotel. The results contribute to theory and practice. First, they provide new insights into how service guarantee programs operate in the field. Specifically, the guarantee was more effective at hotels with a better prior service history and an easier-to-serve guest population, which is consistent with signaling arguments but does not comport with the incentive argument that guarantees actually improve service quality. Second, the results offer managers better decision rules. Specifically, the authors devise program continuation rules that are sensitive to both observed and unobserved differences across sites. In addition, they devise policies to reward hotels that exceed site-specific expectations. By controlling for observed and unobserved differences across sites, the authors show that these policies potentially reward even hotels with negative net program effects, which is useful in reducing the organizational stigma of failure. Finally, the authors identify sites that should be targeted for future program rollout by computing the odds of succeeding.","Xinlei (Jack) Chen, George John, Julie M.

When Should Original Equipment Manufacturers Use Branded Component Contracts with Suppliers?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.5.597,01-Oct-09,01-Oct-09,46,5,597,611,"Branded components are becoming increasingly popular in industrial markets; yet extant research provides limited understanding of the use of such arrangements in the real world. The authors use the governance lens of transaction cost economics to propose that leveraging the vendor's brand reputation and safeguarding the vendor's customization investments are key motivators for choosing branded component contracts. Data on 191 contracts from three engineering-intensive industry sectors provide support to the authors' hypotheses. The authors find that firms are more likely to choose branded component contracts when the supplier's brand name adds significant differentiation (leveraging) and when the component supplier has made significant component customization investments (safeguarding). This safeguarding motivation is relevant even to suppliers with modest brand reputation. The authors also investigate the normative consequences of these contracting decisions and find significant adverse outcomes from choosing the “wrong” contract form. Furthermore, they find that these outcomes are asymmetric in nature. In particular, choosing a “white box” contract when the theory argues for a branded component contract leads to more adverse outcomes than choosing a branded component contract when the theory predicts a “white box” contract. Finally, the authors draw key conclusions for theory and managerial practice.","Mrinal Ghosh, George John","component branding, self-enforcing agreements, transaction cost analysis, business-to-business marketing, organizational relationships",0

Using the cognitive hierarchy framework of Camerer, Ho, and Chong (2004), the authors develop a structural econometric model that estimates the level of strategic thinking. In the model, firms with a high level of strategic thinking are more likely to correctly conjecture the expected actions of their competitors. The authors apply this model to decisions by managers at 2233 Internet service providers of whether to offer their customers access through 56K modems in 1997. The model is validated by showing that firms with a higher estimated probability of strategic thinking were more likely to have survived through April 2007. The estimation results show considerable heterogeneity in the degree to which firms behave strategically and suggest that strategic ability affects marketing outcomes; specifically, a simulated increase in strategic ability means that fewer firms offer the technology to their customers.","Avi Goldfarb, Botao Yang","behavioral game theory, empirical industrial organization, technology diffusion, Internet service providers, cognitive hierarchy",0
The Role of National Culture in Advertising's Sensitivity to Business Cycles: An Investigation across Continents,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.5.623,01-Oct-09,01-Oct-09,46,5,623,636,"The authors conduct a systematic investigation into the cyclical sensitivity of advertising expenditures in 37 countries, covering four key media: magazines, newspapers, radio, and television. They show that advertising is considerably more sensitive to business-cycle fluctuations than the economy as a whole. Advertising behaves less cyclically in countries high in long-term orientation and power distance, but it is more cyclical in countries high in uncertainty avoidance. Furthermore, advertising is more sensitive to the business cycle in countries characterized by significant stock market pressure and few foreign-owned multinational corporations. The authors provide initial evidence on the long-term social and managerial losses incurred when companies tie ad spending too tightly to business cycles. Countries in which advertising behaves more cyclically exhibit slower growth of the advertising industry. Moreover, private-label growth is higher in countries characterized by more cyclical advertising spending, implying significant losses for brand manufacturers. Finally, an examination of 26 global companies shows that stock price performance is lower for companies that exhibit stronger procyclical advertising spending patterns.","Barbara Deleersnyder, Marnik G.

The authors find that foreign takeoffs, but not foreign introductions, accelerate a focal country's time to takeoff. The larger the country, the higher its economic wealth, and the more it exports, the more clout it has in the global spillover process. In contrast, the poorer the country, the more tourists it receives, and the higher its population density, the more susceptible it is to global spillover effects. Cross-country spillover effects are stronger the closer the countries are to one another, both geographically and economically, but not necessarily in terms of culture.

Sales Effects of Attention to Feature Advertisements: A Bayesian Mediation Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.5.669,01-Oct-09,01-Oct-09,46,5,669,681,"There is much evidence that the presence of a feature advertisement can increase the sales and market share of the featured product. However, little is known about how feature ad characteristics (e.g., size, color, and location of the advertisement) affect the sales outcomes and how the effects take place. Prior research has predicted that feature advertisements lead to behavioral outcomes through their effect on consumers' attention. Building on this idea, the authors propose a Bayesian statistical model to study how feature ad characteristics affect sales of the featured products and the mediating role of attention in these relationships. They use data from eye-tracking tests of feature advertisements, aggregated and matched with sales data at the level of the feature advertisement. Their approach accounts for endogeneity in the key variables involved and overcomes limitations of standard mediation analyses. They show that the gaze duration on a feature advertisement affects sales of the featured product beyond the mere presence of the advertisement and that a standard mediation analysis that does not accommodate endogeneity produces biased estimates of the effects of feature ad characteristics on sales. Their proposed methodology is widely applicable to mediation analyses. The findings imply that attention data collected in lab tests can help marketers compare the relative sales outcomes of different feature ad designs and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of feature adverting decisions.","Jie Zhang, Michel Wedel, Rik Pieters","endogeneity, instrument variable, promotion, eye tracking, visual marketing",0

The empirical work controls for factors that are known to influence the bond market, such as firm profitability and risk, as well as potential unobservable factors. The findings indicate that firms with lower customer satisfaction exhibit lower credit ratings and higher debt costs—financial consequences of customer satisfaction not previously observed.

This article challenges this claim. The authors formulate an empirically realistic model of dynamic price competition that allows for differentiated products and imperfect lock-in. They calibrate this model with data from frequently purchased packaged goods markets. These data are ideal in the sense that they have the necessary variation to identify switching costs separately from consumer heterogeneity. Equally important, consumers exhibit inertia in their brand choices, a form of psychological switching cost. This makes the results applicable to the broad range of products that are distinctly identified (i.e., branded) rather than just to products for which there is a product adoption cost or explicit switching fee. In the simulations, prices are as much as 18% lower with than without switching costs.

These regressions use the results of the initial model to correct for the endogeneity of observed market structures. The results from both exercises illustrate several important asymmetries across the firms. Kmart and Wal-Mart prefer similar markets, but Wal-Mart's competitive position is dominant enough to prevent Kmart's operation in otherwise attractive markets. In contrast, Target prefers substantially different market characteristics.

To test for spillovers across competing brands, the authors develop a structural Bayesian learning model and estimate it using prescription choice and marketing communication data from a panel of physicians. From their model results, the authors find evidence of prior and dynamic perception spillovers across competing brands only when brands are sufficiently similar. In contrast, they find no evidence of spillover effects across brands that are highly dissimilar. Finally, several policy experiments illustrate the strength and significance of competitive spillovers for product diffusion, and from the results, the authors derive strategic implications for order-of-entry effects and the entry of “me-too” products.","Ramkumar Janakiraman, Catarina Sismeiro, Shantanu Dutta","spillovers, branding, new products, consumer choice, Bayesian learning framework",3
The Importance of Modeling Temporal Dependence of Timing and Quantity in Direct Marketing,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.4.482,02-Oct-18,01-Aug-09,46,4,482,493,"The analysis of customer value in direct marketing typically combines customer timing and quantity data into a single statistic that is used to compute lifetime values, rank-order customers for differential action, and identify prospects for cross-selling.

In this article, the authors show that customer value calculations can be severely biased in these models when timing and quantity are dependently related. The authors propose alternative models that lead to substantial gains in profitability in two direct-marketing data sets.

“Speed of Replacement”: Modeling Brand Loyalty Using Last-Move Data,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.4.494,02-Oct-18,01-Aug-09,46,4,494,505,"The authors study brand loyalties for durable goods using automobile survey data that are peculiarly censored and track only elapsed times since transitions but not the transition times themselves.

The proposed model fits observed brand choice outcomes even better than a model with a fully unrestricted (and, therefore, highly parameterized) transition structure. The authors also obtain several substantive findings. For example, Chrysler is significantly “weaker” than General Motors and Ford insofar as it has the lowest brand loyalty during the study period.

Predicting New Customers' Risk Type in the Credit Card Market,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.4.506,02-Oct-18,01-Aug-09,46,4,506,517,"Recent studies in marketing have consistently shown that all customers are not equally profitable. In the credit card business, all customers are not equally risky. When a customer misses one payment on a credit card bill, a signal is sent to the credit card company. It is important for the card issuer to interpret the signal and to identify whether the customer is a low-risk one, who will eventually pay back the debt and contribute to the card issuer's profits by paying interest on the overdue balance, or a high-risk one, who will not pay back the debt. The issuer can then customize its policies to deal with these different consumer types. This article develops a dynamic model for debt repayment behavior of new customers in the credit card market that makes it possible to differentiate between low-risk, delinquent customers and high-risk customers.

Category-Based Screening in Choice of Complementary Products,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.4.518,01-Aug-09,01-Aug-09,46,4,518,530,"Consumers often make complex choices involving complementary categories, such as cell phones and service plans. In the fast-growing high-tech and entertainment industries, products from complementary categories are often incompatible with one another. This research shows that when choosing a pair of such complementary products, a consumer is likely to use a two-stage decision strategy: screening by one category first to narrow down the number of pairs for further evaluation in the second stage. In the presence of incompatibility, screening by one category rather than by the other may lead to different choice outcomes. The authors develop a behavioral theory–driven choice model that accounts for both preference heterogeneity and structural heterogeneity of decision strategies to examine the extent to which consumers engage in category-based screening. Analysis of data from a 2 × 2 conjoint choice experiment reveals that consumers tend to screen a category that has higher intracategory differentiation and is congruent with their decision goals. The authors further suggest possible marketing actions a firm can take to promote the use of a specific decision strategy that leads consumers to choose its product.","Anocha Aribarg, Natasha Zhang Foutz","category-based screening, complementary products, decision heuristics, structural heterogeneity, Bayesian",0
Simulated Maximum Likelihood Estimator for the Random Coefficient Logit Model Using Aggregate Data,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.4.531,02-Oct-18,01-Aug-09,46,4,531,542,"The authors propose a simulated maximum likelihood estimation method for the random coefficient logit model using aggregate data, accounting for heterogeneity and endogeneity. The method allows for two sources of randomness in observed market shares: unobserved product characteristics and sampling error. Because of the latter, the method is suitable when sample sizes underlying the shares are finite. In contrast, Berry, Levinsohn and Pakes's commonly used approach assumes that observed shares have no sampling error. The method can be viewed as a generalization of Villas-Boas and Winer's approach and is closely related to Petrin and Train's “control function” approach. The authors show that the proposed method provides unbiased and efficient estimates of demand parameters. They also obtain endogeneity test statistics as a by-product, including the direction of endogeneity bias. The model can be extended to incorporate Markov regime-switching dynamics in parameters and is open to other extensions based on maximum likelihood. The benefits of the proposed approach are achieved by assuming normality of the unobserved demand attributes, an assumption that imposes constraints on the types of pricing behaviors that are accommodated. However, the authors find in simulations that demand estimates are fairly robust to violations of these assumptions.","Sungho Park, Sachin Gupta","random coefficients, logit model, endogeneity, heterogeneity, simulated maximum likelihood, aggregate data, brand choice, scanner data",0

More important, this lack of sensitivity can explain hyperbolic discounting. The results replicate standard hyperbolic discounting effects with respect to objective time but show a relatively constant rate of discounting with respect to subjective time perceptions. The results are replicated between subjects (Experiment 1) and within subjects (Experiments 2), with multiple time horizons and multiple descriptors, and with different measurement orders.

In Experiment 1, bargainers use informational and relational messages to establish a positive social tenor in the interaction. Compared with when bargainers communicate only through offers and counteroffers, explicit communication produces quicker and more efficient agreements. The effects are stronger when manufacturer uncertainty is relatively high. In Experiment 2, mutual reputations of high (versus low) trustworthiness also produce quicker and more efficient agreements. In both studies, the larger extracted surplus increases manufacturer profits without affecting distributor profits. However, contrary to economic intuition, the gains from communication accrue asymmetrically to the uninformed manufacturer. Experiment 3 shows the effects of communication type are contingent on the prevailing level (high or low) of trustworthiness reputations in the dyad. Compared with no communication, relational messages elicit the most positive (negative) outcomes when trustworthiness reputations are high (low). Informational messages have a smaller but positive impact on bargaining outcomes in both trustworthiness conditions and appear to build trust.","Joydeep Srivastava, Dipankar Chakravarti","marketing negotiations, distribution channels, communication, trust, asymmetric information",0

This research examines the implications of the interplay between these two types of decision processes for context effects in choice by exploring the consequences of the depletion of executive resources in a prior, unrelated task. Building on a substantial body of psychological literature that points to a single underlying resource used for self-regulation and executive control, this article demonstrates that resource depletion has a systematic influence on choice in context. Specifically, resource depletion enhances the role of intuitive reasoning by impairing deliberate, careful processing. In five experiments, the authors find that resource depletion increases the share of reference-dependent choices, decreases the compromise effect, and magnifies the attraction effect. The results shed light on the mechanisms underlying context effects in choice and suggest that the scope of the depleted resource is not constrained to self-regulation activities but rather extends to choice in general.","Anastasiya Pocheptsova, On Amir, Ravi Dhar,...","behavioral decision theory, context-dependent preferences, resource depletion, constructed preferences, choice constriction",22

In each study, the authors investigate the incremental effects of introducing multiple prizewinners and unique rank-ordered prizes into a sales contest. The first study consists of two laboratory experiments in which participants make decisions that closely reflect the decision trade-offs in the theoretical model of sales contests. The second study consists of two field economic experiments in which trained salespeople sell fundraising sponsorships to companies. The results across the experiments are remarkably consistent: The number of prizewinners in a sales contest should indeed be greater than one.

However, after experiencing an actual loss in the first gamble, people bet in a subsequent gamble significantly more than they had initially planned, whereas on average, there were no observable differences from the plan after an actual gain. The reason for such asymmetry is due in part to people's tendency to underestimate, at the planning phase of the gamble, the impact of negative emotions in betting decisions during the actual phase of the gamble.","Eduardo B.

Three experiments examine how fear-inducing versus romantic contexts influence the effectiveness of two widely used heuristics—social proof (e.g., “most popular”) and scarcity (e.g., “limited edition”). The results support the predictions from an evolutionary model, showing that fear can lead scarcity appeals to be counterpersuasive and that romantic desire can lead social proof appeals to be counterpersuasive. The findings highlight how an evolutionary theoretical approach can lead to novel theoretical and practical marketing insights.","Vladas Griskevicius, Noah J. Goldstein, Chad R.

To address this question, the authors evaluate a finer level than overall happiness and distinguish three specific types of happiness: with money, with the acquisition of an item, and with the consumption of an item. They find that happiness with money and with acquisition is relative and that happiness with consumption can be either absolute or relative, depending on whether the consumption is inherently evaluable or not. Including both lab and field data, this research yields implications for how to increase consumer happiness from one generation to the next.","Christopher K.

Assortment Size and Option Attractiveness in Consumer Choice among Retailers,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.3.410,01-Jun-09,01-Jun-09,46,3,410,420,"An important decision that retailers make involves selecting the number of items constituting their assortments. A key issue in making these decisions is the role of assortment size in determining consumers’ choice of a retailer. The authors address this issue by investigating how consumer choice among retailers offering various-sized assortments is influenced by the attractiveness of the options constituting these assortments. The data show that consumer preference for retailers offering larger assortments tends to decrease as the attractiveness of the options in their assortments increases and can even lead to a reversal of preferences in favor of retailers offering smaller assortments. This research further presents evidence that the relationship between assortment size and option attractiveness is concave, such that the marginal impact of assortment size on choice decreases as the attractiveness of the options increases. Data from eight empirical studies offer converging evidence in support of the theoretical predictions.","Alexander Chernev, Ryan Hamilton","assortment, retailing, consumer choice, context effects, consumer behavior",0
Differences in Perspective and the Influence of Charitable Appeals: When Imagining Oneself as the Victim is not Beneficial,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.3.421,01-Jun-09,01-Jun-09,46,3,421,434,"Advertisements often stimulate consumers to imagine themselves in a situation in which they would personally benefit from using the product being advertised. However, when an advertisement is intended to induce consumers to benefit someone else (e.g., to donate money for relief of disaster victims), stimulating them to imagine themselves in the situation confronting the beneficiary can sometimes conflict with the image they form of themselves as a potential helper. This conflict in imagined perspective can decrease the advertisement's effectiveness. Five studies confirm this hypothesis. When participants took the perspective of the beneficiary at the time they read an appeal for help, characteristics of the appeal that increased the ease with which they could imagine the situation from this perspective (e.g., a picture of the victim) had a positive effect on both their urge to help and the amount of money they donated. However, when they had an a priori disposition to take the perspective of a potential donor at the time they read the appeal, these same characteristics decreased the appeal's effectiveness.","Iris W.

Does Quality Win?

On the one hand, some researchers assert that high-tech markets are efficient with best-quality brands being dominant. On the other hand, many scholars suspect that network effects lead to perverse markets in which the dominant brands do not have the best quality. The authors develop scenarios about the relative importance of these effects and the efficiency of markets. Empirical analysis of historical data on 19 categories shows that though both quality and network effects affect market share flows, in general markets are efficient. In particular, market share leadership changes often, switches in share leadership closely follow switches in quality leadership, and the best-quality brands, not the ones that are first to enter, dominate the market. Network effects enhance the positive effect of quality.","Gerard J. Tellis, Eden Yin, Rakesh Niraj","network effects, tipping, path dependence, quality, high-tech products",11

The Diffusion of Services,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.2.163,01-Apr-09,01-Apr-09,46,2,163,175,"Many of the products introduced during the past two decades have been services rather than goods. An important influence on the growth and long-term profits of these services is customer attrition, which can occur at the category level (disadoption) or between firms (churn). However, the literature has rarely modeled how services penetrate a market and has not evaluated the effect of attrition on growth. The authors combine diffusion modeling with a customer relationship approach to investigate the influence of attrition on growth in service markets. In particular, the authors model the effects of disadoption and churn on evolution of a category and on growth of individual firms in a competitive environment. The authors show how neglecting disadoption can bias parameter estimation and, especially, market potential. They also derive an expression for the customer equity of a growing service firm and apply it to valuation of firms operating in competitive industries. The results for six of seven firms in four service categories are remarkably close to stock market valuations, an indicator for the role of customer equity in valuations of growing service firms.","Barak Libai, Eitan Muller, Renana Peres","diffusion, attrition, customer relationship management, services",0
How Does Assortment Affect Grocery Store Choice?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.2.176,01-Apr-09,01-Apr-09,46,2,176,189,"The authors investigate the impact of product assortments, along with convenience, prices, and feature advertising, on consumers’ grocery store choice decisions. Extending recent research on store choice, they add assortments as a predictor, specify a general structure for heterogeneity, and estimate store choice and category needs models simultaneously. Using household-level market basket data, the authors find that, in general, assortments are more important than retail prices in store choice decisions. They find that the number of brands offered in retail assortments has a positive effect on store choice for most households, while the number of stockkeeping units per brand, sizes per brand, and proportion of stockkeeping units that are unique to the store (a proxy for presence of private labels) have a negative effect on store choice for most households. They also find more heterogeneity in response to assortment than to either convenience or price. Therefore, optimal assortments depend on the particular preferences of a retailer's shoppers. Finally, the authors find a correlation in household-level responses to assortment and travel distance (r = .43), which suggests that the less important an assortment is to a consumer's store choices, the more the consumer values convenience, and vice versa.","Richard A.

They find that (1) optimization procedures lead to substantial profit improvements over the current practice for all types of promotions (customized and undifferentiated); (2) loyalty promotions are more profitable in online stores than in offline stores, while the opposite holds for competitive promotions; (3) the incremental payoff of individual-level over segment- and mass market–level customized promotions is small in general, especially in offline stores; (4) for categories that are promotion sensitive, individual-level customized promotions can lead to a meaningful profit increase over segment- and mass market–level customized promotions in online stores; and (5) low redemption rates are a major impediment to the success of customized promotions in offline stores.

Quantifying the Benefits of Individual-Level Targeting in the Presence of Firm Strategic Behavior,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.2.207,01-Apr-09,01-Apr-09,46,2,207,221,"The authors develop a method to quantify the benefits of individual-level targeting when the data reflect firm strategic behavior—that is, when firms (1) are engaged in targeting and (2) take into account the actions of competing firms.

For this analysis, the authors develop, at the individual level, a model of prescriptions and a model of detailing. Using physician panel data, they estimate, at the physician level, the parameters of the prescription and detailing models jointly using full-information Bayesian methods. The results suggest that accounting for firm strategic behavior improves profitability by 14%–23% compared with segment-level targeting.

The authors also find that consumers judge others’ behavior more negatively for excluding ethical products than for including ethical products.

In particular, the authors show that both consumers’ preferences for a counterfeit brand and the subsequent negative change in their preferences for the real brand are greater when their luxury brand attitudes serve a social-adjustive rather than a value-expressive function. In addition, consumers’ moral beliefs about counterfeit consumption affect their counterfeit brand preferences only when their luxury brand attitudes serve a value-expressive function. Finally, the authors demonstrate that the social functions served by consumers’ luxury brand attitudes can be influenced by elements of the marketing mix (e.g., product design, advertising), thus enabling marketers to curb the demand for counterfeit brands through specific marketing-mix actions.","Keith Wilcox, Hyeong Min Kim, Sankar Sen","counterfeiting, luxury brands, attitude functions, social identity, advertising",6
The Role of Spatial Demand on Outlet Location and Pricing,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.46.2.260,01-Apr-09,01-Apr-09,46,2,260,278,"In this article, the authors consider the problem of outlet pricing and location in the context of unobserved spatial demand. The analysis constitutes a scenario in which capacity-constrained firms set prices conditional on their location, demand, and costs. This enables firms to develop maps of latent demand patterns across the market in which they compete. The analysis further suggests locations for additional outlets and the resultant equilibrium effect on profits and prices. Using Bayesian spatial statistics, the authors apply their model to seven years of data on apartment location and prices in Roanoke, Va. They find that spatial covariation in demand is material in outlet choice; the 95% spatial decay in demand extends 3.6 miles in a region that measures slightly more than 9.5 miles. They also find that capacity constraints can cost complexes upward of $100 per apartment. As they predict, price elasticities and costs are biased downward when spatial covariance in demand is ignored. Costs are biased upward when capacity constraints are ignored. Using the analysis to suggest locations for entry, the authors find that properly accounting for spatial effects and capacity constraints leads to an entry recommendation that improves profitability by 66% over a model that ignores these effects.","Jason A.

They find that the underlying mechanism for this effect is imagination's impact on the perceived value of new benefits rather than on the learning costs. Furthermore, they show that the advantage of an imaginative focus is not simply due to the increased focus on product benefits, because imagination still leads to higher product evaluation than memory-focused visualization, even if participants in both conditions are asked to think about product benefits exclusively. Finally, an explicit focus on learning costs while using an imaginative approach draws attention away from product benefits and attenuates the advantage of imagination on product evaluation.","Min Zhao, Steve Hoeffler, Darren W.

This proposition is supported in two studies that feature advertising messages. The mechanism underlying these effects differs as a function of implicit theory orientation. Entity theorists’ focus on the outcome and incremental theorists’ reliance on the process form the basis for the observed findings.

When people receive money under negative circumstances, this tag can include a negative affect component, which people aim to reduce by engaging in strategic consumption. The authors investigate two such strategies, laundering and hedonic avoidance, and demonstrate their effect on consumption of windfalls. The authors find that people avoid spending their negatively tagged money on hedonic expenditures and prefer to make utilitarian or virtuous expenditures to reduce, or “launder,” their negative feelings about the windfall.

The results from a set of experiments show that ease of computation can affect judgments of the magnitude of price differences, discount magnitudes, and brand choices. Participants seem to believe that it is easier to judge the size of a larger difference than that of a smaller difference. In the absence of appropriate corrective steps, this naive belief can lead to systematic biases in judgments. For example, when presented with two pairs of numbers, participants incorrectly judged the magnitude of the difference to be smaller for pairs with difficult computations (e.g., 4.97 – 3.96, an arithmetic difference of 1.01) than for pairs with easy computations (e.g., 5.00 – 4.00, an arithmetic difference of 1.00). The effect does not manifest when judgments do not entail mental computations or when participants are made aware that the ease or difficulty is caused by computational complexity. Furthermore, this effect is mitigated when participants’ prior experience is manipulated in a learning phase of the experiment. The results have implications for buyers and sellers and for understanding the role of metacognitive experiences in numerical judgments.","Manoj Thomas, Vicki G.

The model is considered in a charitable giving setting, in which households often receive many direct mailings of different charities within a short period and competition is strong. The authors construct a unique database by merging the databases of three large charity organizations in the Netherlands. This results in household-level data on the direct mailings households received from and their donations to each of the three charities. The results show that a charity's own mailings are short-term substitutes; that is, an extra mailing cannibalizes the revenues of subsequent mailings. Furthermore, competitive charitable direct mailings tend to be short-term complements; that is, the direct mailings increase the total pie that is divided among the charities. In the long run, these effects die out.

The Effect of Partitions on Controlling Consumption,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.6.665,01-Dec-08,01-Dec-08,45,6,665,675,"The authors demonstrate that partitioning an aggregate quantity of a resource (e.g., food, money) into smaller units reduces the consumed quantity or the rate of consumption of that resource. Partitions draw attention to the consumption decision by introducing a small transaction cost; that is, they provide more decision-making opportunities so that prudent consumers can control consumption. Thus, people are better able to constrain consumption when resources associated with a desirable activity (which they are trying to control) are partitioned rather than when they are aggregated. This effect of partitioning is demonstrated for the consumption of chocolates (Study 1) and gambles (Study 2). In Study 3, process measures reveal that partitioning increases recall accuracy and decision times. Importantly, the effect of partitioning diminishes when consumers are not trying to regulate consumption (Studies 1 and 3). Finally, Study 4 explores how habituation may decrease the amount of attention that partitions draw to consumption. In this context, partitions control consumption to a greater extent when the nature of partitions changes frequently.","Amar Cheema, Dilip Soman","self-control, partitions, consumption, attention, guilt",13

Five studies demonstrate that anticipating long-term regret relaxes self-control and motivates consumers to counteract their righteousness. Consumers are more likely to select indulgences and luxuries when they judge the longer-term regrets of others, anticipate their own regret in the distant future, and reflect on their regret regarding an actual decision made in the more distant past. The article concludes with two field experiments that examine the effect of anticipatory regret on real consumer purchases at a shopping mall and during Thanksgiving. These experiments demonstrate that anticipating long-term regret leads consumers to buy pleasurable products rather than practical necessities and to spend more on shopping. The implications for marketers and consumers are discussed.","Anat Keinan, Ran Kivetz","hyperopia, self-control, regret, consumer behavior",22
Positive Consumer Contagion: Responses to Attractive Others in a Retail Context,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.6.690,16-Oct-18,01-Dec-08,45,6,690,701,"This research examines the impact of attractiveness on consumers during a consumption experience. Specifically, it examines the effects of an attractive social influence in the context of touching and contamination of store products by investigating how consumers respond when they see attractive others touching the same products they want to purchase. In doing so, it provides the first experimental evidence of a positive contagion effect in either the marketing or the psychology literature. Across three field experiments using an actual retail shopping environment, the authors find that product evaluations are higher when consumers perceive a product as having been physically touched by a highly attractive other. Moreover, they identify sex as a critical moderating variable in the realization of this positive contagion effect; the contact source and observing consumer must be of the opposite sex for positive contagion to occur. Finally, in contrast to previous work, the authors demonstrate that these effects are driven by a physical model of contagion.","Jennifer J. Argo, Darren W. Dahl, Andrea C.

Endogeneity and Individual Consumer Choice,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.6.702,01-Dec-08,01-Dec-08,45,6,702,714,"In many markets, there is likely to be correlation both across periods in terms of the choices of one consumer and across consumers in terms of their choices in each period. The former is caused by consumer heterogeneity, and the latter may be the result of demand common shocks across consumers. Furthermore, if firms partially observe these common shocks, their market decisions may end up being endogenous and correlated with the common shocks. Because researchers cannot typically fully observe consumer heterogeneity and the common shocks, the estimation method must account for the endogeneity of firms’ decisions. In this article, the authors present a test for endogeneity under unobserved consumer heterogeneity and common shocks, which is based on a quasi-likelihood estimation method, to estimate the model parameters consistently when endogenous firm behavior, unobserved heterogeneity, and common shocks are present. The test examines the differences in general method of moments coefficient estimates of a model with and without instrumenting for the explanatory variables. The authors show theoretically that in their estimation method, unobserved heterogeneity does not affect the consistency of the parameter estimates, but if it is not accounted for, endogeneity may bias the results. They present estimation results from simulated and scanner panel data.","Dmitri Kuksov, J. Miguel Villas-Boas","choice models, panel data, endogeneity, unobserved heterogeneity",1
Who's Got the Coupon?

In this article, the authors propose the use of individual-level Bayesian methods for studying this problem when only aggregate data on consumer choices (market share) and coupon usage (number of distributed coupons and/or number of redeemed coupons) are available. The methodology is based on augmenting the aggregate data with unobserved (simulated) sequences of choices and coupon usage consistent with the aggregate data. The authors analyze various marketing scenarios that differ in terms of their assumptions about consumer choices, coupon availability, and coupon redemption. They illustrate the proposed methods using both simulated data and a real data set for which an extensive set of posterior predictive checks helps validate the aggregate-level estimation. In addition, the authors relate the empirical results to some of the findings in the literature about the coordination of coupon promotions and pricing and show how the methodology can be used to evaluate alternative coupon targeting policies.","Andrés Musalem, Eric T.

In the final two studies, the authors show that variety and uniqueness arrays activate distinct constructs; specifically, they find no effect of exposure to uniqueness arrays on variety seeking (Study 4a) and no effect of exposure to variety arrays on uniqueness seeking (Study 4b). Taken together, these studies build on the existing literature about nonconscious effects on consumer behavior and choice behavior in particular by showing that consumers’ real choices are affected by subtle exposure to novel stimuli that do not have any previous associations.","Michal Maimaran, S.

Winners and Losers in a Major Price War,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.5.499,01-Oct-08,01-Oct-08,45,5,499,518,"Although retail price wars have received much business press and some research attention, it is unclear how they affect consumer purchase behavior. This article studies an unprecedented price war in Dutch grocery retailing that started in fall 2003, initiated by the market leader to halt its sliding market share. The authors investigate the short- and long-term effects of the price war on store visits, on spending, and on the sensitivity of these decisions to weekly prices and price image. They use a unique data set with consumer hand-scan and perceptual data for a national panel of 1821 households, covering two years before and two years after the price war started. Although the price war initially entailed more shopping around and increased spending, spending per visit ultimately dropped because consumers redistributed their purchases across stores. The price war made consumers more sensitive to weekly prices and price image, which helped both the chain that showed an improvement in price image (the price war initiator) and the chains that already had a favorable price image (hard discounters). The price war initiator managed to halt the slide in its market share, and its stock price improved. The losers were the rival mid-level and high-end chains. Unlike the initiator, their price image did not improve, and they suffered from increased price image sensitivity. The authors provide managerial implications for firms that are (or about to be) involved in a price war.","Harald J.

Dancing with a Giant: The Effect of Wal-Mart's Entry into the United Kingdom on the Performance of European Retailers,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.5.519,01-Oct-08,01-Oct-08,45,5,519,534,"The authors examine the value-destroying and value-enhancing effects of a giant player's foreign entry on incumbents operating in that region. They use Wal-Mart's entry into the United Kingdom, through its acquisition of Asda, as the empirical context. Drawing on the marketing, strategy, and finance literature streams, the authors develop hypotheses as to why some incumbents are negatively affected whereas others actually may benefit from the entry of a giant competitor. Their measure of performance impact is the change in shareholder value around the announcement date, which has recently been recognized as an important metric to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing actions. The authors find strong support for the conceptual model, which distinguishes between the seriousness of the threat to the incumbents and their capacity to withstand the threat. The authors validate their findings using three alternative measures of company performance: percentage growth in the incumbent retailer's sales, earnings before interest and taxes, and return on assets between 1998 (the year before the Asda takeover) and 2002 (three years after the takeover). The authors discuss various managerial implications of their results. By acting proactively, incumbents can mitigate the negative performance consequences, while maximally benefiting from the positive implications of a giant competitor's entry.","Katrijn Gielens, Linda M.

Individual Team Incentives and Managing Competitive Balance in Sports Leagues: An Empirical Analysis of Major League Baseball,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.5.535,10-Oct-18,01-Oct-08,45,5,535,549,"Major League Baseball and other professional sports leagues have long been concerned with competitive imbalances caused by differences in local revenues. The fear is that in the absence of salary caps or other regulatory mechanisms, smaller-market teams will be unable to remain competitive. This research uses a structural dynamic programming model to analyze ownership's payroll investment decisions. This model estimates the relationship between optimal payrolls and local-market populations and the influence of long-term customer equity dynamics on payroll investments. In addition, the author analyzes the impact of a recent policy intervention that implemented revenue transfers from high-local-revenue markets to low-local-revenue markets. The statistical results indicate that market population has a significant impact on the value of a team's payroll investments. For example, optimal payrolls double as the population increases from 2.5 million to 7.5 million. Furthermore, rather than improving competitive balance, the adoption of revenue sharing has decreased the incentives for small-market teams to remain competitive. The author uses the estimation results to evaluate alternative approaches to managing competitive balance. Specifically, the results suggest that basing revenue-sharing payments on local-market population and (higher) attendance rates reduces payroll dispersion.",Michael Lewis,"customer equity, sports marketing, dynamic programming, alliance management",0
Interorganizational Relationships and Bidding Behavior in Industrial Online Reverse Auctions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.5.550,01-Oct-08,01-Oct-08,45,5,550,561,"The authors model (1) the impact of the supplier's relationship propensity before the auction on the supplier's bidding aggressiveness in the auction (in terms of the number of bids it submits, the rate at which the bids are submitted, and the price concessions offered) and (2) the impact of bidding behaviors in the auction on the buyer–supplier relationship after auction through longitudinal survey data from 12 online reverse auctions across various product categories. The results suggest that incumbency, many bidders, and a willingness to make specific investments lead to less aggressive bidding, whereas the total number of bids from competing suppliers increases aggressiveness. In turn, aggressive bidding behavior reduces suppliers' disposition toward developing a relationship with the buyer and sours incumbent satisfaction with the relationship. Finally, auctions that are longer in duration can improve the relationship but may risk bidding competition. Collectively, the results suggest that pricing and relationships are intertwined and traded off against each other in complex ways and that the auction does not operate in isolation of key organizational variables.","Sandy D.

Eliciting Preference for Complex Products: A Web-Based Upgrading Method,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.5.562,01-Oct-08,01-Oct-08,45,5,562,574,"The authors propose a new incentive-aligned upgrading method for eliciting attribute preferences in complex products, which combines the merits of a self-explicated approach and conjoint analysis. The upgrading method first endows a participant with a product profile and then allows him or her to upgrade it, one attribute at a time, to a more desirable product configuration. During the process, the participant states his or her willingness to pay for each potential upgrade he or she is interested in, and a BDM (Becker–DeGroot–Marschak) procedure ensures that it is in the best interest of the participant to state truthfully his or her willingness to pay. Each participant receives the upgraded product at the end of the study. The authors empirically implement this procedure in a Web-based study with digital cameras.

To Innovate or Imitate? Entry Strategy and the Role of Market Research,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.5.575,01-Oct-08,01-Oct-08,45,5,575,592,"A firm planning market entry can attempt to develop a product that is either similar to the incumbent's existing offering (imitation) or entirely novel (innovation). The authors establish that when the incumbent is more aggressive in research and development (R&D), this negatively affects the entrant's marginal return on R&D. Thus, if greater profits produce a strong (weak) desire for the incumbent to increase its R&D level, the entrant will respond by sharply decreasing (increasing) its R&D level. As a result, the incumbent's likelihood of retaining the lead position will exhibit an inverse U-shaped pattern as a function of monopoly and duopoly profits. The authors then examine the impact of uncertainty about the rewards from new products and allow firms to conduct market research to resolve the uncertainty. They characterize the conditions for the entrant's innovation versus imitation decision to reveal information about future rewards to the incumbent. When duopoly profits are uncertain and can be either high (upside potential) or low (downside potential), the entry strategy will be revealing if the upside potential is attractive enough relative to monopoly profits. In contrast, when innovation has uncertain commercial potential (i.e., either valued or not valued by consumers), the entry strategy will be revealing if duopoly profits are unattractive relative to monopoly profits. In these cases, the entrant's innovation–imitation decision is driven by market research; this allows the incumbent to forgo market research and infer the true state of demand from the type of entry strategy it observes.","Elie Ofek, Ozge Turut","new product development, entry strategy, market research, innovation management",0

The model facilitates inference about respondents' preferences for choice alternatives, their diligence in providing responses, and the accessibility of attitudes and the speed of thinking. Thus, the model distinguishes between respondents who are quick to think and those who are quick to react but do so without much thought. Empirically, the authors find support for the endogenous nature of response times and demonstrate that models that treat response times as exogenous variables may result in misleading inferences.","Thomas Otter, Greg M.

Massive questionnaires are pervasive in marketing practice. As an alternative to the heuristic methods that are currently used to split questionnaires, this study develops a methodology to design the split questionnaire in a way that minimizes information loss. Using estimates from a first wave or pilot study, the authors apply the modified Fedorov algorithm using the Kullback–Leibler distance as a design criterion to find the optimal splits. Their design criterion is based on a general mixed data model that accommodates continuous, rank-ordered, and discrete measurement scales. The optimal construction of the split questionnaire design is easy and fast. The authors use Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures to impute missing values that result from the design. They generate split questionnaire designs by selecting either entire blocks of questions (between-block design) or sets of questions in each block (within-block design). They compare the efficiency of split questionnaires generated with the proposed method with multiple matrix sampling designs, incomplete block designs, and a heuristic procedure, using synthetic and empirical Web survey data. The authors illustrate in a field study that as a result of reduced respondent burden, the quality of data using split questionnaire designs improves.","Feray Adigüzel, Michel Wedel","questionnaire design, missing data, Kullback–Leibler distance, modified Fedorov algorithm, multiple imputation",0

The model is shown to be general enough to apply to any discrete promotion in which the carryover effect duration is unknown. The authors present several model-based metrics that allow for an objective comparison of a BPP's return on investment with that of other forms of promotion. The results suggest that a BPP, when contrasted with feature, leads to higher sales lift per household for some of the brands.

The authors propose that this phenomenon, which they term “reverse alliesthesia,” occurs as a result of the activation of a general motivational state by cues that are high in incentive value. They test this proposition by showing that the effect is (1) attenuated if the activated motivational state is satiated before the subsequent consumption task and (2) stronger for people who are high rather than low on the behavioral activation system scale. Finally, the authors extend their core findings to nongustatory cues by showing that (un)pleasant odors can also lead to an increase (decrease) in subsequent reward-seeking behaviors.","Monica Wadhwa, Baba Shiv, Stephen M.

For decisions that are mainly driven by achievement of gains (e.g., investment decisions), men's risk-taking propensity is more influenced by their levels of issue capability than women's because the nature of the decision task is consistent with men's agentic orientation focused on the self. Conversely, for decisions that are mainly driven by avoidance of losses (e.g., insurance decisions), women's risk taking is more sensitive to issue capability than men's because the nature of such decisions is consistent with women's communion orientation.

Importantly, these effects are moderated by the information seeker's goal orientation. The information provider's experience in responding to questions in different domains of knowledge increases judgments of information value for information seekers with a decision-making orientation, whereas the information provider's reputation for providing valuable contributions within the focal domain increases judgments of information value for information seekers with a learning orientation.","Allen M.

Specifically, consumers are more sensitive to the price of components that provide low consumption benefits than to the price of components that provide relatively high consumption benefits. Consequently, when evaluating different partitions of the same total price, consumers prefer partitions in which the price of the low-benefit component is lower and the price of the high-benefit component is higher.","Rebecca W.

They capture distribution intensity by car make (e.g., Honda, Toyota) at the disaggregate level using the exact geographic locations of individual buyers and new car dealers. They develop three buyer-centric measures for the intensity level of each competing make from this information: (1) dealer accessibility (the buyer's distance to the nearest outlet for each make), (2) dealer concentration (the extent to which multiple dealers for each make are located near a given buyer), and (3) dealer spread (the dispersion of the multiple dealers for each make relative to the buyer's location). The authors propose a logit choice model, estimated with Bayesian methods, to study the association of these measures with new car choices. They apply the model to buyer records in the midsize premium sedan category, drawn from an anonymous sample provided by the Power Information Network. All three buyer-centric measures of intensity were significantly related to new car choice. Buyers were more likely to select cars whose dealer networks had shorter distances to the closest outlet (accessibility), more dealers within a given radius from the buyer (concentration), and locations that skewed toward the buyer (spread). Based on the modeling results, the market share elasticity of distribution intensity averages approximately .6 across the new car models included in the study. The approach should help firms evaluate the potential effects of expanding or contracting distribution networks for mature products.","Randolph E. Bucklin, S. Siddarth, Jorge M.

They develop a dynamic structural model of a household that decides when, what, and how much to buy, as well as how much to consume, to maximize its expected utility over an infinite horizon. By making certain simplifying assumptions, the authors reduce the dimensionality of the problem. They estimate the proposed model using household purchase data in the canned tuna and paper towels categories. The results from the model offer insights into the decomposition of promotional effects into its components. This could help managers make inferences about which brand's sales are more responsive to stockpiling or increase in consumption expansion and how temporary price cuts affect future sales. Contrary to previous literature, the authors find that brand switching is not the dominant force for the increase in sales. They show that brand-loyal consumers respond to a price promotion mainly by stockpiling for future consumption, whereas brand switchers do not stockpile at all. The authors also find that heavy users stockpile more, whereas light users mainly increase consumption when there is a price promotion.","Tat Chan, Chakravarthi Narasimhan, Qin Zhang","decomposition of promotional effects, dynamic structural model, flexible consumption, consumer heterogeneity",3

A Clusterwise Bilinear Multidimensional Scaling Methodology for Simultaneous Segmentation and Positioning Analyses,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.3.280,01-Jun-08,01-Jun-08,45,3,280,292,"The segmentation–targeting–positioning conceptual framework has been the traditional foundation and genesis of marketing strategy formulation. The authors propose a general clusterwise bilinear spatial model that simultaneously estimates market segments, their composition, a brand space, and preference/utility vectors per market segment; that is, the model performs segmentation and positioning simultaneously. After a review of related methodological research in the marketing, psychometrics, and classification literature streams, the authors present the technical details of the proposed two-way clusterwise bilinear spatial model. They develop an efficient alternating least squares procedure that estimates conditional globally optimum estimates of the model parameters within each iteration through analytic closed-form expressions. The authors present various model options. They provide a conceptual and empirical comparison with latent-class multidimensional scaling. They use an illustration of the new bilinear multidimensional scaling methodology with an actual commercial study sponsored by a large U.S. automotive manufacturer to examine buying/consideration intentions for small sport-utility vehicles. The authors conclude by summarizing the contributions of this research, discussing the marketing implications for managers, and providing several directions for further research.","Wayne S.

The Impact of Brand Equity and Innovation on the Long-Term Effectiveness of Promotions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.3.293,01-Jun-08,01-Jun-08,45,3,293,306,"Although managers often hope to obtain long-term benefits with temporary marketing actions, academic studies imply that their chances are slim. Extant research has implicitly assumed that the brand itself carries no influence over whether marketing promotions have the power to lift sales permanently. Using panel data for seven years from 100 brands across seven product categories, the authors employ a two-stage approach in which long-term promotional effectiveness is first estimated with persistence modeling and then these effectiveness estimates are related to brand equity and new product introductions. By examining a broad range of brands in each category, the authors find that positive sales evolution from promotional efforts is fairly common, especially for small brands. Moreover, the authors find that both permanent and cumulative sales effects from marketing promotions are greater for brands with higher equity and more product introductions, whereas brands with low equity gain greater benefits from product introductions. These results offer new research and managerial insights into the presence and conditions for persistent benefits from marketing promotions.","Rebecca J.

Managing Consumer Uncertainty in the Adoption of New Products: Temporal Distance and Mental Simulation,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.3.320,01-Jun-08,01-Jun-08,45,3,320,336,"Drawing on theories of new product adoption and intertemporal choice, the authors show in cross-sectional and longitudinal investigations (Study 1) that when adoption is in the distant future, people are more concerned about performance- and symbolic-benefit uncertainties. In contrast, in the near future, the concerns are more about switching- and affective-cost uncertainties. In Studies 2 and 2a, using theories of mental simulation, the authors show that in the distant-future adoption scenario, communication strategies that promote outcome simulations are more effective in reducing performance uncertainty, bolstering positive feelings, and enhancing behavioral intentions. In contrast, in the near-future adoption scenario, communication strategies that promote process simulations are better at reducing switching cost and affective uncertainties, assuaging anxiety, and increasing behavioral intentions. The authors also find positive effects of these communication strategies on actual adoption rates and postconsumption satisfaction (Study 2) and on delayed behavioral intentions (Study 2a). In addition, these communication strategies are more efficacious in increasing behavioral intentions when uncertainty levels are higher (Study 3). The key managerial implications are that communication strategies for new products need to reduce uncertainties about costs and benefits and account for temporal distance to adoption.","Raquel Castaño, Mita Sujan, Manish Kacker,...","new products, temporal distance, mental simulation, postconsumption satisfaction, communication strategies",3
How Far Can a Brand Stretch?

This research examines the role of an individual-difference variable (self-construal) in enhancing a brand's stretchability potential. It is postulated that an interdependent self-construal leads to a superior ability to uncover relationships among stimuli (e.g., an extension and its parent brand) and thus is likely to enhance the perceived fit of an extension and the likelihood of its acceptance. However, these beneficial effects are likely to emerge only under conditions in which the interdependent consumer is motivated to elaborate extensively on the extension information.

Disposition Effects and Underlying Mechanisms in E-Trading of Stocks,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.3.362,01-Jun-08,01-Jun-08,45,3,362,378,"People have a tendency to sell stocks more quickly if their value has increased since the time they were purchased than if their value has decreased during this period.

Based on an analysis of transaction data in a simulated trading environment, Study 1 provides evidence of the disposition effect in a newly emerging Internet-based stock trading (“e-trading”) situation. Three laboratory studies then examine the mechanisms that underlie the effect. The magnitude of the disposition effect is unaffected by experimental manipulations of the subjective likelihood of future gains or losses. However, it is eliminated by inducing participants to define gains and losses in similar subjective units. Furthermore, the effect depends on whether participants make selling decisions on their own stocks or serve as an agent for someone else. Thus, the disposition effect is largely a result of differences in the subjective value that participants attach to possible gains and losses rather than of differences in their beliefs that these outcomes will occur.

This explanation is corroborated by controlled experiments involving potential home buyers and professional real estate price setters.

The authors argue that this is not necessarily the case. Instead, they show that when people learn preferences in context (e.g., through repeated choices made from a trinary choice set that includes an asymmetrically dominated decoy), they learn a context-specific choice heuristic (e.g., they always choose the asymmetrically dominating option), which leads to less consistent preferences across contexts. In contrast, repeated choices from sets containing only two options impel people to learn their subjective attribute weights, yielding preferences that are consistent across contexts. The difference between choice construction and preference construction is of importance to marketing managers because repeat purchase is typically interpreted as a signal of customer preference. The authors show that this “preference” might just be a learned solution to the choice problem and that as soon as the competitive context changes (even in a normatively meaningless way), so will consumers' preferences.","On Amir, Jonathan Levav","behavioral decision theory, preference learning, context-dependent preferences, constructed preferences, choice construction",0
Can Trade-Ins Hurt You? Exploring the Effect of a Trade-In on Consumers' Willingness to Pay for a New Product,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.2.159,01-Apr-08,01-Apr-08,45,2,159,170,"When consumers decide to upgrade to a new or better product, they often trade in their currently owned or used product for the new one. The authors examine whether such trade-in behavior, in which consumers must negotiate the price for both the new and the used product, affects their willingness-to-pay price for the new good. Drawing on research on mental accounting, the authors reason that when consumers engage in a transaction involving a trade-in (i.e., when they act as both buyer and seller simultaneously), they place more importance on getting a good value for the used product than on getting a good price for the new product. As a result, such consumers exhibit a higher willingness-to-pay price for the new product than consumers who just buy the new product alone. The results from a series of laboratory experiments provide systematic support for this hypothesis.

In doing so, they must frequently choose among items that are grouped in assortments, such as those offered by a particular store or brand. This article examines how the number of to-be-purchased items influences consumer choice among assortments. It is argued that when consumers are uncertain about their preferences, they are more likely to prefer an assortment for which the number of available options matches the desired purchase quantity. This prediction is based on the notion that a match between the size of an assortment and the number of to-be-purchased items enables consumers to simplify the selection process by eliminating the need to trade off the benefits and costs of individual choice alternatives—a strategy referred to as the “quantity-matching heuristic.” The theoretical predictions are supported by data from five empirical studies that offer converging evidence for the role of purchase-quantity goals in assortment choice and identify moderating factors and boundary conditions.",Alexander Chernev,"assortment, purchase quantity, consumer choice, heuristics, retailing",0
Incorporating Subjective Characteristics in Product Design and Evaluations,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.2.182,01-Apr-08,01-Apr-08,45,2,182,194,"Consumers often use both objective and subjective criteria to evaluate a product.

This research emphasizes incorporating subjective characteristics in new product design. The authors propose a model in which consumers' purchase intentions can be affected by both the objective attributes and the subjective characteristics. This model has the form of a hierarchical Bayesian structural equation model, in which the subjective characteristics are treated as latent constructs. The authors also propose a Bayesian forecasting procedure in which the estimated relationships are used to improve the out-of-sample prediction. They illustrate the proposed approach in two empirical studies. The results indicate that by collecting additional information about consumers' perceptions of the subjective characteristics, the proposed model provides the product designer with a better understanding and a more accurate prediction of consumers' product preferences than the traditional conjoint models.","Lan Luo, P.K.

A Conjoint Approach to Multipart Pricing,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.2.195,10-Oct-18,01-Apr-08,45,2,195,210,"Multipart pricing is commonly used by service providers such as car rentals, prescription drug plans, health maintenance organizations, and wireless telephony. The general structure of these pricing schemes is a fixed access fee, which sometimes entitles users to a certain level of product use; a variable fee for additional use; and still another fee for add-on features that are priced individually and/or as bundles. The authors propose a method using conjoint analysis for multipart pricing. The method reflects the two-way dependence between prices and consumption and incorporates consumers' uncertainty about their use of a service. The proposed method estimates both choice probabilities and usage levels for each consumer as functions of the product features and the different price components. The authors then use these estimates to evaluate the expected revenues and profits of alternative plans and pricing schemes. They illustrate this method using data from a conjoint study of cell phone services. They compare the results with those obtained from using several competing models. Finally, they use the proposed procedure to identify the optimal set of features in a base plan and the pricing of optional features for a provider of cell phone services.","Raghuram Iyengar, Kamel Jedidi, Rajeev Kohli","conjoint analysis, multipart pricing, optimal product design",0
The Effect of Competitive Advertising Interference on Sales for Packaged Goods,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.2.211,10-Oct-18,01-Apr-08,45,2,211,225,"Competitive advertising interference can occur when viewers of advertising for a focal brand are also exposed to advertising messages for competing brands within a short period (e.g., one week for television advertising). Although competitive advertising interference has been shown to reduce advertising recall and recognition and brand evaluation measures, no studies have examined its impact on brand sales. In this research, the authors use a market response model of sales for two grocery categories for a large grocery chain in the Chicago area to study the extent to which competitive advertising interference influences sales. The model enables the authors to capture the “pure” own-brand advertising elasticities that would arise if there were no competitive interference. The results show that competitive interference effects on sales are strong. When one or more competing brands advertise in the same week as the focal brand, the advertising elasticity diminishes for the focal brand. The decrease depends on the number of competing brands advertising in a particular week and their total advertising volume. The authors find that having one more competitor advertise is often more harmful to a focal brand's advertising effectiveness than if the current number of advertising brands increase their total advertising volume.","Peter J.

The Temporal and Spatial Dimensions of Price Search: Insights from Matching Household Survey and Purchase Data,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.2.226,01-Apr-08,01-Apr-08,45,2,226,240,"Price promotions are pervasive in grocery markets. A household can respond to price promotions by effectively cherry-picking through (1) spatial price search across stores and (2) temporal price search across time. However, extant research has analyzed these two dimensions of price search only separately and therefore underestimates both the consumer response to price promotions and the impact of promotions on retail profit. In this article, the authors introduce an integrated analysis of spatial and temporal price search. They seek answers to three questions: First, what are the predictors of household decisions to perform either spatial or temporal price search? Second, how effective are the temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal price search strategies in obtaining lower prices? and Third, what is the impact of alternative price search strategies on retailer profit? The authors use a unique data collection approach that combines household surveys with observed purchase data to address these questions. Their key results are as follows: Geography (the spatial configuration of store and household locations) and opportunity costs are useful predictors of a household's price search pattern. Households that claim to search spatiotemporally avail approximately three-quarters of the available savings on average. Households that search only temporally save about the same as those that search only spatially. The negative effect of cherry-picking on retailer profits is not as high as is typically believed.","Dinesh K. Gauri, K.

This view suggests that firm/representative trust is not always critical, especially for customers with high trust in the context. An alternative perspective is that trust in the context fosters and legitimates trust in firms and their representatives. This view implies that firm/representative trust is a necessary mediator of the influence of trust in the context.

In turn, this increased accessibility influences product evaluation and choice, which are found to vary directly with the frequency of exposure to conceptually related cues.

Analysis shows that perceived brand relevance and energy provide incremental information to accounting measures in explaining stock returns. However, esteem and knowledge do not; that is, their effects are reflected in current-term accounting measures and in brand relevance and energy. The financial markets do not view brand differentiation as having incremental information content, but they should. Changes in differentiation are indicative of future-term accounting performance, which in turn affects stock return. These conclusions are invariant to the use of alternative accounting performance measures, risk adjustments, and the inclusion of additional brand attributes into the analysis.","Natalie Mizik, Robert Jacobson","brand equity, brand dimensions, stock return, financial market performance, brand energy",0

Recommendation Systems with Purchase Data,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.1.077,01-Feb-08,01-Feb-08,45,1,77,93,"Many firms use decision tools called “automatic recommendation systems” that attempt to analyze a customer's purchase history and identify products the customer may buy if the firm were to bring these products to the customer's attention.

First, the method improves on existing procedures by allowing different items to be differentially useful for measuring ERS and by accommodating the possibility that an item's usefulness differs across groups (e.g., countries). Second, the model integrates an advanced item response theory measurement model with a structural hierarchical model for studying antecedents of ERS. The authors simultaneously estimate a person's ERS score and individual- and group-level (country) drivers of ERS. Through simulations, they show that the new method improves on traditional procedures.

Assessing Three Sources of Misresponse to Reversed Likert Items,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.45.1.116,01-Feb-08,01-Feb-08,45,1,116,131,"Data collected through multi-item Likert scales that contain reversed items often exhibit problems, such as unexpected factor structures and diminished scale reliabilities.

Counter to prevailing thought, the patterns of misresponse and response latency across manipulated items could not be attributed to respondent inattention or acquiescence. Instead, the pattern supports an item verification difficulty explanation, which holds that task complexity, and thus misresponse and response latency, increases with the number of cognitive operations required for a respondent to compare a scale item with his or her belief.

A Model of Consumer Learning for Service Quality and Usage,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.4.529,01-Nov-07,01-Nov-07,44,4,529,544,"In many services (e.g., the wireless service industry), consumers choose a service plan according to their expected consumption. In such situations, consumers experience two forms of uncertainty. First, they may be uncertain about the quality of their service provider and can learn about it after repeated use of the service. Second, they may be uncertain about their own usage of minutes and learn about it after observing their actual consumption. The authors propose a model to capture this dual learning process while accounting for the nonlinearity of the pricing scheme used in wireless services. The results show that both quality learning and quantity learning are important. The authors conduct several policy experiments to capture the effects of consumer learning, pricing, and service quality on customer lifetime value (CLV). They find that consumer learning can result in a win–win situation for both consumers and firm; consumers leave less minutes on the table, and the firm experiences an increase in overall CLV. For example, the authors find that there is a 35% increase (approximately $75) in overall CLV with consumer learning than without. The key driver of this result is the change in the retention rate with and without learning.","Raghuram Iyengar, Asim Ansari, Sunil Gupta",,0
Brand-Level Effects of Stockkeeping Unit Reductions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.4.545,01-Nov-07,01-Nov-07,44,4,545,559,"When retailers make product assortment changes by eliminating certain stockkeeping units (SKUs), how does this affect sales of individual brands? This is the main question the authors address in this article. Using data from an online retailer that implemented a permanent systemwide SKU reduction (SR) program, the authors investigate how the program affected various components of purchase behavior for individual brands. They find substantial variations in the SR effects across brands, categories, and consumers. They explore possible drivers for these differences and find that higher-market-share, higher-priced, and more frequently promoted brands tend to gain share and that reduction in the number of sizes, reduction in the number of SKUs, and change in SKU share in the category are important in affecting change in a brand's purchase share after the SR. They also find that SRs lead to an increase in category purchase incidence and quantity for highly state-dependent consumers and frequent buyers but a decrease in category purchase and quantity for mildly state-dependent consumers and infrequent buyers. In addition, SRs tend to cause more changes in brand choice probabilities among consumers of lower state dependence and higher price and promotion sensitivity. These findings are of importance both to retailers wanting to make product assortment changes and to manufacturers affected by them.","Jie Zhang, Aradhna Krishna",,0
Optimal Marketing Strategies for a Customer Data Intermediary,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.4.560,01-Nov-07,01-Nov-07,44,4,560,578,"Advances in data collection and storage technologies have given rise to the customer data intermediary (CDI), a firm that collects customer data to offer customer-specific marketing services to marketers. With widespread adoption of customer relationship management (CRM) and one-to-one (1:1) marketing, the demand for such services continues to grow. Extant empirical research using customer data for CRM and 1:1 marketing tends to have an engineering emphasis and focuses on developing analysis techniques to implement CRM and 1:1 marketing optimally (i.e., the technology for the CDI). In contrast, this article focuses on marketing strategy issues that the intermediary faces, given the availability of the technology to implement such services. Specifically, the authors develop an empirical framework to evaluate the optimal customer (exclusive/nonexclusive), product (quality or accuracy of the 1:1 customization), and pricing strategy for a CDI. They illustrate the framework for one type of CDI—a 1:1 coupon service firm that caters to grocery manufacturers—using household purchase history data from the ketchup market. The authors find that selling on a nonexclusive basis using the maximum available purchase history data is the most profitable strategy for the CDI in the particular market. They also evaluate the potential impact of retailers entering the 1:1 coupon service business. Because 1:1 marketing can increase the retailer's profits from goods sold, it is optimal for the retailer to undercut the prices of a pure-play CDI that offers 1:1 coupon services.","Joseph Pancras, K.

Optimal Customer Relationship Management Using Bayesian Decision Theory: An Application for Customer Selection,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.4.579,01-Nov-07,01-Nov-07,44,4,579,594,"This study addresses significant challenges that practitioners face when using customer lifetime value (CLV) for customer selection. First, the authors propose a Bayesian decision theory–based customer selection framework that accommodates the uncertainty inherent in predicting customer behavior. They develop a joint model of purchase timing and quantity that is amenable for selecting customers using CLV. Second, the authors compare performance of the proposed customer selection framework (1) with the current customer selection procedure in the collaborating firm and (2) with different customer-level cost allocation rules that are necessary for computing CLV. The study finds that given a budget constraint, customers selected by means of a Bayesian decision theory–based framework (i.e., using the maximized expected CLV of a customer and the corresponding optimal marketing costs as an estimate of future costs) provide the highest profits. The study provides guidelines for implementation and illustrates how the proposed customer selection framework can aid managers in enhancing marketing productivity and estimating return on marketing actions.","Rajkumar Venkatesan, V.

A Discrete–Continuous Model for Multicategory Purchase Behavior of Households,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.4.595,01-Nov-07,01-Nov-07,44,4,595,612,"This article provides an integrated utility-maximizing framework for households’ multicategory purchase incidence, brand choice, and purchase quantity decisions. On a store visit, households maximize utility across several categories subject to an overall budget constraint. Then, they choose to purchase a subset of categories, in which they select a specific brand and an associated quantity level. Under their assumptions for the stochastic terms in the specification, the authors obtain closed-form expressions for the household demands, the marginal and joint purchase incidence, and the brand choice probabilities along with conditional purchase quantities. The authors show that the modeling framework accounts for both coincidence and complementarity/ substitutability across categories. In addition, it accounts for unobserved heterogeneity in the estimation. Thus, the three key features of multicategory models proposed in the literature are all reflected in the framework. The authors provide an empirical application of the methodology using four categories from the Stanford market basket data—laundry detergent, fabric softener, toilette tissue, and paper towel. The results indicate that, in general, cross-category effects, as measured by the cross-category price elasticities between brands in the categories, are small, and they arise mostly through consumers’ joint purchase incidence decisions rather than at the purchase quantity decision conditional on brand choice. This finding indicates that the effects of coincidence are larger than the effects of complementarity in these data.","Inseong Song, Pradeep K. Chintagunta",,3
Estimating Disaggregate Models using Aggregate Data through Augmentation of Individual Choice,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.4.613,01-Nov-07,01-Nov-07,44,4,613,621,"In this article, the authors propose a Bayesian method for estimating disaggregate choice models using aggregate data. Compared with existing methods, the advantage of the proposed method is that it allows for the analysis of microlevel consumer dynamic behavior, such as the impact of purchase history on current brand choice, when only aggregate-level data are available. The essence of this approach is to simulate latent choice data that are consistent with the observed aggregate data. When the augmented choice data are made available in each iteration of the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, the dynamics of consumer buying behavior can be explicitly modeled. The authors first demonstrate the validity of the method with a series of simulations and then apply the method to an actual store-level data set of consumer purchases of refrigerated orange juice. The authors find a significant amount of dynamics in consumer buying behavior. The proposed method is useful for managers to understand better the consumer purchase dynamics and brand price competition when they have access to aggregate data only.","Yuxin Chen, Sha Yang",,0
An Econometric Model of Location and Pricing in the Gasoline Market,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.4.622,01-Nov-07,01-Nov-07,44,4,622,635,"The authors propose an econometric model of both the geographic locations of gasoline retailers in Singapore and price competition among retailers conditional on their geographic locations. Although market demand for gasoline is not observed, the authors are able to infer the effects of such demand from stations’ locations and pricing decisions using available data on local market-level demographics. Using the proposed location model, which is based on the assumption of social welfare maximization by a policy planner, the authors find that local potential gasoline demand depends positively on the local demographic characteristics of the neighborhood. Using the proposed pricing model, which is based on the assumption of Bertrand competition between retail chains, the authors find that retail margins for gasoline are approximately 21%. The authors also find that consumers are willing to travel up to a mile for a savings of $.03 per liter. Using the estimates of the proposed econometric model, the authors answer policy questions pertaining to a recent merger between two firms in the industry. Answering these questions has important policy implications for both gasoline firms and policy makers in Singapore.","Tat Y. Chan, V. Padmanabhan, P.B. Seetharaman",,3
Measuring Consumer and Competitive Impact with Elasticity Decompositions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.4.636,01-Nov-07,01-Nov-07,44,4,636,646,"Marketing investments are designed to change consumer behavior in ways that help goods compete in the marketplace. Previous research has focused on using elasticity decompositions to measure how these investments affect either consumer decision making or competing goods. On the one hand, decision-based decompositions attribute the growth in own-good demand to changes in the consumers’ decision-making processes. On the other hand, unit-based and share-based decompositions attribute the same growth to either rivalrous or nonrivalrous sources. The objective of this article is to provide a clear and accurate method that simultaneously attributes the growth in own-good demand to changes in (1) consumers’ decisions, (2) competitive demand, and (3) competitive market share. The author accomplishes this by settling some confusion about what the decision- and share-based decompositions mean, by discussing how each of the decompositions are related to the others, and by discussing the research questions that each of the decompositions can answer. From a managerial perspective, the author discusses how this method can be used to simplify and clarify the data needed for decision making.",Thomas J. Steenburgh,,0
Shopper Response to Bundle Promotions for Packaged Goods,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.4.647,01-Nov-07,01-Nov-07,44,4,647,662,"Bundle promotions—the practice of granting consumers a discount when they buy a certain number of units from a designated range of stockkeeping units—have gained popularity among manufacturers and retailers. In this research, the authors investigate the purchase effects of bundle promotions for a category of packaged goods. Contrary to intuition, they find that promotional bundles are far more effective at inducing switching than at boosting category sales. The strong switching effects result from two mechanisms: (1) Stockkeeping units that are part of a bundle promotion appear to reinforce each other's choice probability, and (2) the bundle discount tends to attract consumers even if they do not buy enough to qualify for the price reduction. The weak category effects follow from the notion that the purchase quantity requirement is often too stringent to make consumers buy earlier and/or more in the category. The authors develop incidence, quantity, and choice models that incorporate the intricate bundle mechanisms, and they use simulations to contrast the sales impact of bundle and traditional per-unit promotions. On the basis of the model estimates, they present managerial implications and tentative guidelines for optimal bundle design.","Bram Foubert, Els Gijsbrechts",,0
Brand Synergy Effects in Multiple Brand Extensions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.4.663,01-Nov-07,01-Nov-07,44,4,663,670,"Three experiments demonstrate that the simultaneous introduction of two brand extensions can have a positive influence on their evaluations independently of parent–extension similarity. This “synergy” effect occurs when the extensions are complementary (e.g., a digital camera and a digital photo printer) but is not evident when they belong to the same category (two models of digital cameras) or to unrelated categories (a digital camera and a snowboard). In addition, the effect is restricted to extension products that are introduced by the same manufacturer. Finally, it occurs only among participants who are promotion focused and therefore are disposed to consider the benefits of owning the extensions rather than the disadvantages of doing so. These and other results suggest that the synergy effect is due to the appeal of completing a set of related products from the same manufacturer rather than the physical or functional similarity of their features to those of either the parent or each other.","Byung Chul Shine, Jongwon Park, Robert S.

In two experiments, 1000 adolescents saw either antismoking advertising about smoking's social consequences or control advertising in a television show. The authors find that for promotion-focused adolescents, a promotion-focused positively framed antismoking message is the most effective at persuading them not to smoke; for prevention-focused adolescents, a prevention-focused negatively framed antismoking message is the most effective. The enhanced ad effectiveness is mediated by message accessibility and diagnosticity.","Guangzhi Zhao, Cornelia Pechmann",,4

When message cues make manipulative intent highly salient or when manipulative intent is not salient, brand evaluations do not differ across regulatory foci. In addition, externally priming suspicion of manipulative intent makes promotion-focused people react similarly to prevention-focused people, suggesting that regulatory focus affects vigilance against persuasion.","Amna Kirmani, Rui (Juliet) Zhu",,0

These predictions are confirmed. Furthermore, an analysis of the intensities of these specific emotions reveals the following additional insights: (1) Under conditions in which the options in a choice set meet or exceed both functional and hedonic cutoffs, consumers attach greater importance to the hedonic attribute, and (2) whereas the functionally superior option is preferred in choice tasks, the hedonically superior one is preferred in willingness-to-pay tasks.","Ravindra Chitturi, Rajagopal Raghunathan, Vijay Mahajan",,0

Four studies manipulate the fluency of preference formation by presenting descriptions in an easy- or difficult-to-read font (Study 1) or by asking participants to think of few versus many reasons for their choice (Studies 2–4). As the authors predict, subjective experiences of difficulty increase choice deferral (Studies 1 and 2) and the selection of a compromise option (Studies 3 and 4), unless consumers are induced to attribute the experience to an unrelated cause. Unlike studies of decision conflict, these effects are obtained without changing the attributes of the alternatives, the composition of the choice sets, or the reference points.

The Shopping Momentum Effect,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.3.370,01-Aug-07,01-Aug-07,44,3,370,378,"Shopping momentum occurs when an initial purchase provides a psychological impulse that enhances the purchase of a second, unrelated product. The authors propose that the most promising theoretical mechanism for shopping momentum comes from Gollwitzer's (1990) theory of implementation and deliberation mind-sets. Under this theory, shopping momentum occurs because the initial purchase moves the consumer from a deliberative to an implemental mind-set, thus driving subsequent purchases. After demonstrating the main shopping momentum effect, the authors support the mind-set theory by (1) demonstrating how an initial purchase induces implemental orientation and (2) by illustrating that an implementation mind-set leads to greater purchase. The authors then explore the boundaries of this effect by demonstrating how shopping momentum can be interrupted. Finally, they discuss alternative theoretical accounts for the results and explore consequences for marketing managers.","Ravi Dhar, Joel Huber, Uzma Khan",,58
Mental Simulation and Preference Consistency over Time: The Role of Process- versus Outcome-Focused Thoughts,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.3.379,01-Aug-07,01-Aug-07,44,3,379,388,"Research on choice over time has found that people tend to focus on concrete aspects of near-future events and abstract aspects of distant-future events.

In this research, the authors integrate research on choice over time with mental simulation. They propose and show that counter to people's natural tendencies, outcome simulation for near-future events and process simulation for distant-future events lead to preference consistency over time.

With regard to the form of monitoring, the results from a longitudinal field study of buyer–supplier relationships show that output monitoring decreases partner opportunism, as transaction cost and agency theory predict, whereas behavior monitoring, which is a more obtrusive form of control, increases partner opportunism. With regard to the context, the authors find that informal relationship elements in the form of microlevel social contracts serve as buffers that both enhance the effects of output monitoring and permit behavior monitoring to suppress opportunism in the first place.","Jan B.

Rather than assuming that firms are perfectly forward looking and therefore solving accordingly for dynamic equilibriums that would arise in the presence of state dependence, the authors systematically evaluate whether boundedly rational firms indeed look ahead when they set prices and, if so, to what extent. They illustrate the procedure using household-level scanner-panel data on breakfast cereals and replicate the substantive results using data on ketchup. The authors find that (1) omission of state dependence in demand biases inference of firm behavior (i.e., tacit collusion is erroneously inferred when firms are competitive); (2) observed retail prices are consistent with a pricing model in which both manufacturers and retailers are forward looking (i.e., they incorporate the effects of their current prices on their future profits), but firms have short time horizons when setting prices (i.e., they look ahead by only one period, suggesting that firms are boundedly rational in their dynamic pricing behavior); and (3) even a myopic pricing model of firms that accounts for state dependence in demand is a reasonable approximation of the observed prices in the market.","Hai Che, K.

However, the resultant increase in consumer inventory has two potential benefits: increased category consumption and preemptive brand switches (the additional inventory of the promoted brand preempts the consumer's purchase of a competing brand in the future). Furthermore, there is a potential impact on repeat purchases of the stockpiled brand after the promotion. In this article, the authors present a model and simulation-based method to measure the benefits and costs of stockpiling and assess their relative magnitudes. They find that the benefits are substantial, but consumption appears to be the most important, followed by preemptive switching and then an increase in repeat purchases. These benefits easily offset the negative aspect of consumer stockpiling—namely, purchase acceleration by loyal customers who would have bought the brand at regular price at a later date.","Kusum L.

They have been touted as effective means of deterring competitor entry, informing potential customers, and even tipping the balance of technological standard battles in favor of the preannouncing firms. However, preannouncements also carry the risks of unwanted competitive reaction and the negative consequences of undelivered promises. From a shareholder value standpoint, do the benefits outweigh the risks of preannouncing? To address this question, the authors build on agency and signaling theories to develop hypotheses about the effects of preannouncements on shareholder value, and they empirically test these hypotheses on a sample of software and hardware new product preannouncements. The findings indicate that the financial returns from preannouncements are significantly positive in the long run. The authors show that preannouncements generate positive short-term abnormal returns only for firms that offer specific information about the preannounced product. They also show that firms earn positive long-term abnormal returns after a preannouncement if they continue to update the market on the progress of the new product. Both the short-term and the long-term returns are further magnified if the reliability of the preannouncement (i.e., the credibility of the preannouncing firm) is high. The findings offer executives of preannouncing firms clear guidelines on how to manage communications in the market to extract financial value from new product preannouncements.","Alina Sorescu, Venkatesh Shankar, Tarun Kushwaha",,0

A key finding is that consumers are myopic and prefer contracts with lower payment streams even when they have higher total costs. The authors also find that consumers are more likely to lease than to finance cars with higher maintenance costs because this provides them with the option to return the car before maintenance costs become too high.

In most industries, competing firms may have competitive sales data from syndicated services or trade organizations, but they seldom have access to data on competitive promotions at the customer level. Promotion response models in the literature either have ignored competitive promotions, focusing instead on the focal firm's promotions and sales response, or have considered the ideal situation in which the analyst has access to full information about each firm's sales and promotion activity. The authors propose a random coefficients hidden Markov promotion response model, which takes the competitor's unobserved promotion level as a latent variable driven by a Markov process to be estimated simultaneously with the promotion response model. This enables the authors to estimate cross-promotion effects by imputing the level of competitive promotions. The authors test the proposed model on synthetic data through a Monte Carlo experiment. Then, they apply and test the model to actual prescription and sampling data from two main competing pharmaceutical firms in the same therapeutic category. The two tests show that compared with several benchmark models, the proposed random coefficients hidden Markov model successfully imputes unobserved competitive promotions and, accordingly, reduces biases in the own- and cross-promotion parameters. Furthermore, the proposed model provides better predictive validity than the benchmark models.","Sangkil Moon, Wagner A. Kamakura, Johannes Ledolter",,3
Hedging Your Bets and Assessing the Outcome,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.3.516,01-Aug-07,01-Aug-07,44,3,516,524,"Hedging offsets the risk of an existing stake by counterbalancing it with a new stake—for example, complementing a bet on the race favorite with another bet on a promising upstart. In three experiments, the authors find that rather than assessing the hedge as a whole, people tend to react to the hedging outcome by focusing on either the original stake or the new one. The authors show that the hedger's focus is linked to a psychological motivation of whether to pursue safety and security by minimizing losses, known as a “prevention orientation,” or to pursue growth and advancement by maximizing gains, known as a “promotion orientation.” When the context is gambling, prevention-oriented people fixate on what happens to the status quo stake, whereas promotion-oriented people attend to the new stake (Experiment 1). The same conclusion emerges from a stock-investing context (Experiments 2a and 2b). Moreover, because selective attention to status quo and change is the mechanism at work, the authors find that a choice between options characterized as maintaining the status quo elicits greater discrimination among prevention-oriented than promotion-oriented people; similarly, a choice between options characterized as initiating change elicits greater discrimination among promotion-oriented than prevention-oriented people (Experiment 3). These effects drive behavioral intentions.","Susan Jung Grant, Ying Xie",,0

They find that only salesperson-owned loyalty, a newly identified construct, directly affects the more tangible seller financial outcomes of sales growth and selling effectiveness, whereas both salesperson-owned loyalty and loyalty to the selling firm increase the customer's willingness to pay a price premium. A longitudinal study verifies that the positive effect of salesperson-owned loyalty on sales growth persists over time. However, because salesperson-owned loyalty simultaneously increases the seller's risk of losing business if the salesperson defects to a competitor, managers need to manage effectively the benefit–risk trade-off. Increasing relationship-enhancing activities and value received by the customer builds both salesperson-owned loyalty and loyalty to the selling firm. The loyalty-building impact of relationship-enhancing activities is moderated by selling-firm consistency and by the selling firm's and salesperson's loyalty-capturing strategies.","Robert W.

Reservation Price as a Range: An Incentive-Compatible Measurement Approach,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.2.200,01-May-07,01-May-07,44,2,200,213,"Drawing from the literature on buyers' uncertainty in preference and product knowledge, the authors suggest and empirically test the proposition that a consumer's reservation price for a product is more meaningfully and accurately represented as a range than as a single point. Given this conceptualization, they propose an approach for incentive-compatible elicitation of a consumer's reservation price range (ICERANGE) that builds on Becker, DeGroot, and Marschak's (1964) point-of-purchase method. Two empirical applications of the approach provide an assessment of its practicality and its predictive performance relative to current methodologies for reservation price elicitation. The results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the benchmark approaches in terms of predictive validity and yields valuable incremental information about uncertainty in product valuation.","Tuo Wang, R.

The Effect of Measurement Task Transparency on Preference Construction and Evaluations of Personalized Recommendations,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.2.224,01-May-07,01-May-07,44,2,224,233,"Marketing activities frequently involve personalizing product offers to consumers' individually measured preferences. Because preferences are often ill-defined, responses to customized offers may depend on how easy it is for consumers to identify the preferences they stated in the measurement task. A series of experiments shows that the likelihood of choosing a personalized recommendation that matches measured preferences most closely is greater with measurement tasks that allow consumers to identify their stated preferences more easily (i.e., transparent tasks). However, this difference in choice likelihood due to task transparency is observed only for novices (versus experts), and making the identification of stated preferences more difficult eliminates the effect by decreasing the choice likelihood following more (versus less) transparent tasks. The author identifies consumers' understanding of their own preferences as the mechanism underlying the task transparency effect. The findings provide evidence that consumers must be able to “see through” or understand the construction of their preferences to maximize utility.",Thomas Kramer,,3

A mall-intercept field study shows that consumers with a chronic disposition to be promotion focused own more new high-technology goods and newly launched repeat-purchase items than prevention-focused consumers. There is no difference in ownership of products that have been available for many years. Two laboratory experiments further investigate these findings. In Study 2, the authors manipulate regulatory focus and find that when risks associated with a really new product are not specified to consumers, promotion-focused consumers state higher purchase intentions than prevention-focused consumers. However, when the judgmental context makes the risks salient, prevention- and promotion-focused participants are equally unlikely to purchase the product. Study 3 demonstrates that consumers' self-regulation is unrelated to purchase intentions for products that are not portrayed as new. Mediation analyses in both laboratory studies show that the effect of regulatory focus on purchase intentions for new products is due to concerns about the performance of the new technology, which are more pronounced among prevention-focused consumers. Finally, the authors discuss managerial implications.","Michal Herzenstein, Steven S. Posavac, J. Joško Brakus",,0

The authors take an intrapsychic perspective on social desirability and propose that the presence of others––in the absence of direct interaction––leads to the automatic activation of a concern with the impression others are forming. They find that words applicable to social desirability are accessed faster when respondents are in the presence of another person than when they are alone. Across three experiments, semantic (but not perceptual) memory for words and advertisements applicable to social desirability is greater than that for neutral cues after respondents are exposed to these in the actual or imagined presence of others than when they are alone. Respondents' chronic impression management tendencies (self-monitoring) moderate the effects, suggesting that the effects are, at least in part, determined by motivational factors. This novel theoretical framework provides direct implications for advertisers and marketing researchers who rely on recall memory as one of the most common measures of advertising effectiveness.","Stefano Puntoni, Nader T.

The authors propose a process according to which impulsive eaters (versus nonimpulsive eaters) spontaneously develop a promotion focus on exposure to hedonically tempting food, such as chocolate cake; their subsequent decision to consume the food is guided by this promotion orientation. Furthermore, the evoked promotion focus also influences subsequent choices in completely unrelated domains.

The mere measurement effect has been attributed to an increased accessibility of the attitude toward the behavior. Another source of the mere measurement effect may be the redundancy in the cognitive processes used to generate the mere measurement response and the cognitive processes used to decide whether to engage in the behavior. Process redundancy creates a fluency that can be interpreted as supportive of the behavioral tendency. Across eight studies, the authors show that processing fluency also contributes to the mere measurement effect.","Chris Janiszewski, Elise Chandon",,3

In other words, the authors propose a “no-regret” rule in bidding. They impose no other restrictive assumptions on “maximands” or the bidders' behaviors in a competitive auction context. The authors model WTP as having two components: a pure product feature component and one based on the auction market environment. The latter includes bidder experience, seller reputation, and measures for competition among bidders and items. The proposed model is general enough to include a “buy-it-now” (equivalent to a posted price) auction mechanism. The authors use data on notebook auctions from one of the largest Internet auction sites in Korea. They find that most product characteristics matter in the expected ways. There are two additional primary findings: First, WTP declines as more similar items are concurrently listed with the focal item; there is an additional effect if these similar items also belong to the same brand. Therefore, market thickness matters for consumer WTP. Second, more extensive site surfing and bidding histories lead to lower WTP, implying that search costs and experience matter in bidding. As specific substantive benefits, the authors demonstrate how sellers can calculate changes in WTP and, thus, the expected revenue as the number of concurrently available similar items varies.","Tat Y.

The marketing literature offers little guidance on how to do this, and the psychology literature suggests that negative initial impressions are much more resistant to change than positive initial impressions. The authors contrast the efficacy of comparative and noncomparative new information about a target brand when the initial impression of the brand is positive or negative. A body of extant research shows that positive initial impressions change more in the face of comparative information than when the same information is noncomparative and does not mention a competitor. The authors replicate this effect for positive initial impressions but deduce and show that the opposite is true for negative initial impressions. Thus, the authors show that when evaluations are memory based rather than stimulus based and when the initial evaluation is negative, new information that is noncomparative leads to a greater change in consumer attitudes. The authors discuss the implications of this finding for firms that are attempting to recover from negative initial impressions.","A.V. Muthukrishnan, Amitava Chattopadhyay",,0

The authors of this comment extend this surprising and previously undocumented result in several respects. First, they replicate this basic finding in France and find that it is robust to time and region aggregation and data duration. Second, because of regional variation in chain locations and the limited research on the relative effect of chains on market shares, they link chain effects to market shares in France. The authors find that (1) chain effects explain more variation in market share than either time or region effects and (2) the addition of chain effects attenuates region-specific effects. Thus, chain structure is both another source of regional variation in demand and an important consideration in its own right. Finally, by coupling brand–time effects with longer data, the authors note that brand–time effects are larger than brand–region effects in France. This result suggests the importance of long-term effects in marketing and the need to collect longer durations of data to explain variation in market shares.","M. Berk Ataman, Carl F. Mela, Harald J.

They also show how to assess the economic value of each channel to each firm and to its customers. They apply such policy simulations to the personal computer market, which is characterized by multiple firms competing through various channels using multiple products. The analysis quantifies the profit impact on firms and the welfare impact on consumers of many proposed channel actions and provides an economic rationale for different actions observed in this marketplace, such as decisions to add or drop marketing channels.

Competitive Pricing of Information: A Longitudinal Experiment,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.1.042,01-Feb-07,01-Feb-07,44,1,42,56,"Theoretical work on the pricing of information reveals that competition between independent information sellers can result in prices that are negatively related to the quality or reliability of the information. The theory argues that when information products are unreliable (low quality), independent products become complements, and competition can increase prices. The goal of this study is to test empirically the theory's counterintuitive predictions with the help of an experimental market based on a business simulation. Information products are market forecasts that are available from different competing information sellers; information buyers use these products to make repeated marketing decisions. Sellers set prices to maximize their profit, and buyers decide from which sellers to buy to maximize their own profit (through their marketing decisions). Buyers and sellers are assigned to one of two quality conditions: high-quality, reliable information and low-quality, unreliable information. The reliability of information products (forecasts) is exogenously set and must be inferred by both buyers and sellers from historical forecasts about another market. The results from this experimental market fully support the theory. After some experimentation, prices converge to levels that are strikingly different between the two quality conditions: Prices are significantly higher when the information sold is unreliable (low quality). Moreover, with few competing sellers of low-quality information, prices are higher than with a single seller or with a large number of competing sellers.","Markus Christen, Miklos Sarvary",,0
Why Some Acquisitions Do Better than Others: Product Capital as a Driver of Long-Term Stock Returns,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.44.1.057,01-Feb-07,01-Feb-07,44,1,57,72,"Corporate acquisitions are strategic actions that loom large in the minds of many senior managers. Despite decades of study, little systematic research exists on a central question: Why do the acquisitions of some firms perform better than those of others? The work that has examined this question has mostly focused on deal-specific variables (i.e., how the acquisitions are conducted). In this article, the authors highlight a firm-specific, marketing-driven variable—namely, product capital—that affects acquisition performance and predicts which firms are better positioned to acquire in the first place. The authors also present a mechanism by which product capital affects performance— namely, through acquirers' superior selection and deployment of targets' innovation potential. This article shows that firms with high product capital (i.e., those with greater product development and support assets) make smarter acquisition decisions. Such firms are better at selecting targets with innovation potential and then deploying this potential to gain competitive advantage. The performance consequences of this superiority in the selection and deployment of target firms manifest in the long-term financial rewards to the acquiring firm. The results of an analysis of acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry across seven countries and over 11 years (1992–2002) provide empirical support for the arguments.","Alina B.

In addition, the authors find that a firm's competitor orientation, as embodied in its strategies and objectives, can strengthen or weaken this curvilinear effect. Overall, these findings indicate that both competition and cooperation have dark sides that a firm must carefully manage when working with rivals.","Xueming Luo, Aric Rindfleisch, David K. Tse",,0
Is Obesity Caused by Calorie Underestimation?

By developing a psychophysical model of meal size estimation, the authors show that the association between body mass and calorie underestimation found in health science research is a spurious consequence of the tendency of high-body-mass people to choose—and thus estimate—larger meals. In four studies involving consumers and dieticians, the authors find that the calorie estimations of high- and low-body-mass people follow the same compressive power function; that is, they exhibit the same diminishing sensitivity to meal size changes as the size of the meal increases. The authors also find that using a piecemeal decomposition improves calorie estimation and leads people to choose smaller, but equally satisfying, fast-food meals. The findings that biases in calorie estimation are caused by meal size and not body size have important implications for allegations against the food industry and for the clinical treatment of obesity.","Pierre Chandon, Brian Wansink",,8

Therefore, this research examines the effectiveness of health messages that present consequences for the self or for the family, focusing specifically on the dual role of emotions in serving these stakes as a provider of resources and information. The authors theorize that (1) the valence dimension of discrete emotions influences resources, thus fostering or hindering the processing of aversive health information, whereas (2) the self-/other-relatedness dimension of discrete emotions provides information that interacts with the focal referent in the message (self or family) to determine compatibility. In Experiments 1–3, the authors demonstrate that when people are primed with a positive emotion (e.g., happiness, peacefulness), the compatibility between the referent and the discrete emotion fosters the processing of health information. When the primed emotion is negative (e.g., sadness, agitation), however, compatibility hinders processing of the message. In Experiment 4, the authors track emotions before and after exposure to a health message to demonstrate that the observed effect occurs because of an increase in the negative emotional state in compatible situations when people process disease-related information. The authors conclude by discussing the implications of the findings for increasing the effectiveness of health-related messages.","Nidhi Agrawal, Geeta Menon, Jennifer L. Aaker",,0

The results show that money can function as the invoking cue for this rule, that the reliance on this rule can undermine utility maximization, and that this rule may be used as a first response to the decision problem but can be overridden.

In this article, the authors focus on identifying which customers are vulnerable to defection despite their stated high levels of satisfaction. Building on the recently developed Judgment Uncertainty and Magnitude Parameters (JUMP) model, the authors decompose customers' stated satisfaction into two related but independent facets—satisfaction level and satisfaction strength—and then examine the role of satisfaction strength in the translation of satisfaction into loyalty. Using data from an ongoing customer satisfaction tracking study being conducted by a large U.S.-based service organization, Study 1 examines the role of satisfaction strength in shaping the satisfaction–loyalty link in a business-to-business setting. Study 2, a conceptual replication in a business-to-consumer context, examines the hypothesized relationships in a service failure/recovery situation. The studies strongly demonstrate that satisfaction strength plays a central role in the translation of stated satisfaction into loyalty. A key finding is that though satisfaction translates into loyalty when satisfaction is strongly held (i.e., low uncertainty), the translation is significantly lowered, on average, by approximately 60% when the same satisfaction is more weakly held (i.e., high uncertainty). The studies also indicate that prior relationship aspects (length of relationship, volume of business, and favorability of prior experiences) result in even greater vulnerability.","Murali Chandrashekaran, Kristin Rotte, Stephen S.

The authors examine alternative theoretical predictions about the impact of stating expectations before purchase on postpurchase perceptions of the shopping experience and the firm. In particular, the authors suggest that asking customers to articulate their expectations can backfire and lead to lower postpurchase evaluations of the shopping and consumption experience. A series of field experiments indicate that compared with a control group, stating prepurchase expectations leads customers to focus on negative aspects of the shopping experience and perceive the same performance more negatively. The tendency for consumers to rate their shopping experiences less favorably after stating prepurchase expectations is inconsistent with confirmation bias as well as assimilation, contrast, and positivity effects. The final study contrasts the impact of stating expectations about the next store shopping experience with the impact of evaluating the store's past performance. The results show that though (prepurchase) expectations are indistinguishable from evaluations of the store's past performance, the former leads to lower postpurchase than prepurchase evaluations, whereas the latter tends to generate higher postpurchase evaluations.

Using data on all promotions offered in 2003 by CVS, a leading U.S. drug retailer, the authors (1) quantify the gross promotional lift; (2) decompose this into switching, stockpiling, and incremental lift for the retailer; (3) estimate the extent to which promotion affects sales of other product categories in the store to compute the net unit impact of the promotion; (4) account for promotional and nonpromotional margins and manufacturer funding to compute the net profit impact of the promotion; and (5) examine how promotion, brand, category, and store characteristics influence the net impact. The authors find that approximately 45% of the gross lift is incremental for CVS, and there is also a significant, positive halo effect on sales of other categories. However, on average, the net profit impact of promotions is negative because CVS's promotional margin is often substantially less than regular margin. In the authors' analysis of the correlates of net impact, they find that many promotion and brand characteristics have opposing associations with net unit and net profit impact. Deep, featured promotions on high “consumer-pull” brands generate high net unit impact, but they significantly reduce CVS's promotional margin, resulting in lower net profit impact. Therefore, the retailer must make some difficult trade-offs between revenue and profit objectives in promotion decisions.","Kusum L. Ailawadi, Bari A. Harlam, Jacques César,...",,0
The Short- and Long-Term Impact of an Assortment Reduction on Category Sales,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.4.536,01-Nov-06,01-Nov-06,43,4,536,548,"In a collaborative study with a major Dutch retailer, the authors assess the short- and long-term effects of a 25% item reduction on category sales. On an aggregate level, a major assortment reduction can lead to substantive short-term category sales losses but only a weak negative long-term category sales effect. Short-term category sales losses are caused mainly by fewer category purchases by former buyers of delisted detergent items. However, the results also show that the assortment reduction attracts new category buyers. These new buyers partially offset the sales losses among former buyers of the delisted items. The collection of supplemental process data on assortment perceptions and actual search time in the test stores before and after the assortment reduction provides evidence that delisting results in an increase in perceived search efficiency and a decrease in actual search time.","Laurens M.

Consensus brand maps include the core brand associations that define the brand's image and show which brand associations are linked directly to the brand, which associations are linked indirectly to the brand, and which associations are grouped together. Two studies illustrate the Brand Concept Maps methodology and provide evidence of its reliability and validity.","Deborah Roedder John, Barbara Loken, Kyeongheui Kim,...",,13
A Three-Stage Model of Integrated Marketing Communications at the Marketing-Sales Interface,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.4.564,01-Nov-06,01-Nov-06,43,4,564,579,"The marketing and sales functions in many firms are often at odds despite their common goal of increasing revenue and profit. The finger pointing goes both ways: Marketing complains of poor lead follow-up by sales, and in turn, sales grumbles about the quality of leads generated by marketing. This disconnect can be damaging; high lead volumes generated through effective marketing campaigns could actually hurt downstream sales because of wasted effort on poorly qualified leads and/or delays in sales follow-up resulting from limited sales force capacity. To examine the revenue and profit implications of coordinated communications efforts at the marketing-sales interface, the authors develop a three-stage model that captures the effects of sequential marketing/sales communications on lead generation, appointment conversion, and sales closure. The results, which are based on a collaborative effort with a large home improvement retailer, suggest a complex interplay among marketing efforts (multiple media that generate leads), delays in follow-up (time lag between inquiry and sales force contact), and sales efficiencies (appointment and sales conversion). The findings underscore the impact of multimedia spending on the timing and effectiveness of subsequent communications, implying that improved internal collaboration between marketing and sales can offer significant upside potential for the firm. Finally, the authors develop a managerial decision support tool to simulate the impact of varying communications budgets, timing, and allocation on the marketing and sales planning system.","Timothy M.

The Role of Relational Embeddedness in Retail Buyers' Selection of New Products,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.4.580,01-Nov-06,01-Nov-06,43,4,580,587,"Retailers face considerable risk in introducing new products because of high failure rates. Given the proliferation of new products juxtaposed against finite shelf space, retail buyers are confronted with a choice problem. To enhance understanding of this issue, the authors examine the role of buyer-salesperson and firm-firm relationships using data collected in the context of actual new product selection by retail buyers at two large grocery retailers in the United States. The findings indicate that buyer-salesperson and firm-firm relationships have a greater influence on new product acceptance when a new product's attractiveness is modest than when the new product is very unattractive or very attractive. At modest levels of product attractiveness, the likelihood of new product acceptance can increase by as much as 60% when the buyer has a strong relationship with the salesperson. The study provides insights into the complex interplay of marketing relationships and product attractiveness in retail buyers' selection of new products.","Peter Kaufman, Satish Jayachandran, Randall L.

Optimal Pricing Strategies for an Automotive Aftermarket Retailer,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.4.588,01-Nov-06,01-Nov-06,43,4,588,604,"The extant retail category pricing optimization literature concentrates on grocery retailing. In contrast, this article focuses on the problem of determining profit-improving store-level prices of failure-related “hard-part” product categories at a U.S. specialty automotive part retailer with 3400 stores. There are some key institutional differences between automotive hard-part and grocery retailing: No syndicated data are available for hard parts; each subclass of a hard-part category contains variants that are ordered by quality (typically “Good,” “Better,” “Best”); there is intra- but no intersubclass competition; market shares of variants and their prices are not positively correlated within a subclass; a consumer enters the market only infrequently; and at a purchase occasion, a consumer buys one and only one variant within a subclass and one and only one unit of that variant. Using two years of weekly sales histories from 800 stores, the authors develop store-level demand models for 23 subclasses of a hard part and employ these with available product cost data to set prices of variants of each subclass at each store that increase profit. The authors test the model-recommended prices for 10 subclasses in a field experiment involving 500 stores, leading to a projection of an annual increase of more than $610,000 in the retailer's profit from these 10 subclasses if the new prices are applied at all stores. The empirical analysis also yields new insights into asymmetric price competition across quality variants and deviations of actual from optimal prices that run counter to previous grocery retailing-based findings.","Murali K.

The authors develop and test a framework that contends that low-fat nutrition labels increase food intake by (1) increasing perceptions of the appropriate serving size and (2) decreasing consumption guilt. Three studies show that low-fat labels lead all consumers—particularly those who are overweight—to overeat snack foods. Furthermore, salient objective serving-size information (e.g., “Contains 2 Servings”) reduces overeating among guilt-prone, normal-weight consumers but not among overweight consumers. With consumer welfare and corporate profitability in mind, the authors suggest win-win packaging and labeling insights for public policy officials and food marketers.","Brian Wansink, Pierre Chandon",,138

The results from three experiments show greater decline in consumers' discount rates with time horizon (i.e., greater present bias) when they defer than when they expedite consumption. These results are robust to using monetary and nonmonetary outcomes, as well as to different time horizons (months, days). The authors further demonstrate that the different levels of mental representations (concreteness) triggered by the two decision frames moderate this difference in sensitivity.","Selin A.

The three experiments reported in this article examine reasons that underlie urges that strengthen over time and cause people to overindulge from a goal-theoretic view of impulsiveness. The authors demonstrate that impulsivity is characterized by generalized reward sensitivity and by an activation of chronic goals to seek pleasure in various domains (Experiment 1). Furthermore, through a moment-to-moment tracking of desires, the authors demonstrate that such chronic goals, particularly in conjunction with temporarily primed goals, provide the momentum for impulsive people to override their self-control goals, leading to a strengthening of desires over time (Experiment 2). In turn, this causes impulsive people to behave even more impulsively when their activated hedonic goals are not satiated (Experiment 3). The findings suggest that contextual cues have powerful influences on impulsive behavior over time when acting in conjunction with chronic hedonic goals. The results have public policy implications for behaviors such as binge drinking and unrestrained eating.","Suresh Ramanathan, Geeta Menon",,1

Experiment 1 shows that the tendency to deemphasize prescreening information leads to systematically different choices for decision makers who screen alternatives compared with decision makers who do not screen alternatives. Additional studies show that screening encourages decision makers to shift their emphasis from prescreening information to postscreening information (Experiment 2). Prescreening information is deemphasized because of the categorization that occurs when people create a consideration set of retained alternatives (Experiments 3 and 4). Together, the results show that a brand's strength of consideration (i.e., how highly an option ranks on screening criteria) may have little influence on the likelihood of it being chosen in a postscreening choice process.","Amitav Chakravarti, Chris Janiszewski, Gülden Ülkümen",,0

In contrast, other firms are proactively involved in designing customized solutions to individual customer needs. The authors call the former “low vendor customization control” and the latter “high vendor customization control.” Despite the strategic importance of customization, no research has shed light on the rationale for using these contrasting approaches to customization and their normative consequences. The authors develop a conceptual model that contends that the appropriate level of vendor control over the customization decision is a function of technology and knowledge considerations. They use data on 304 procurement arrangements for customized products to test their hypotheses and to explore the normative ramifications for three key measures of performance: closeness of the delivered product to customer needs, delivery performance, and the vendor's operating profits. The results show that contracting parties choose the level of vendor control over customization in a strategic and discriminating way to enhance the benefits from customization for both parties.

The author accommodates heterogeneity in preferences and in decision rules. The proposed model uses observed choices to infer both attribute preference ratings and criterion attributes. The results show empirically, in a field setting, that the product attributes evaluated in Stage 1 differ from those evaluated in Stage 2. Consistent with existing theory, consumers tend to use simpler decision rules based on a subset of attribute information in earlier stages. The author also finds some preliminary evidence that attributes such as price and size tend to be considered in only one of the two stages, whereas ingredient attributes tend to be considered in both stages. From a managerial perspective, the identification of criterion attributes, coupled with the preference parameters estimated by the model, can assist with the targeting and positioning of promotional strategies.",Wendy W.

Controlling for salesperson gender and selling experience, structural equation modeling indicates that ASB increases self-rated, manager-rated, and objective measures of performance, whereas CO increases only self-rated performance. Both ASB and CO increase job satisfaction. Tests of reciprocal relationships indicate that ASB increases CO and job satisfaction increases performance rather than vice versa. Selling experience increases performance but not job satisfaction, and saleswomen rate their performance and satisfaction slightly higher than salesmen do. The magnitudes of the relationships indicate that ASB and selling experience have greater effects than CO and gender on salesperson performance.","George R. Franke, Jeong-Eun Park",,3

Marketing models are usually applications of standard economic theories, which rely on strong assumptions of rationality of consumers and firms. Behavioral economics explores the implications of the limits of rationality, with the goal of making economic theories more plausible by explaining and predicting behavior more accurately while maintaining formal power. This article reviews six behavioral economics models that are useful to marketing. Three models generalize standard preference structures to allow for sensitivity to reference points and loss aversion, social preferences toward outcomes of others, and preference for instant gratification. The other three models generalize the concept of game-theoretic equilibrium, allowing decision makers to make mistakes, encounter limits on the depth of strategic thinking, and equilibrate by learning from feedback. The authors also discuss a specific marketing application for each of these six models. The goal of this article is to encourage marketing researchers to apply these models. Doing so will raise technical challenges for modelers and will require thoughtful input from psychologists who study consumer behavior. Consequently, such models could create a common language both for modelers who prize formality and for psychologists who prize realism.","Teck H. Ho, Noah Lim, Colin F. Camerer",,0

The first question is whether behavioral economics is, in reality, a new form of theoretical psychology, competing with existing psychological models and theories and subject to the same vulnerability to evidence as applies to psychological theory. The author argues that behavioral economists are ambivalent about this point, sometimes claiming psychological realism or plausibility as a necessary modeling requirement and other times introducing assumptions for modeling convenience. The second question is whether the impact of behavioral economics on marketing will be experienced more strongly through the development of new quantitative models or through the exploration of qualitative lessons stimulated by behavioral violations of rationality. It is argued that behavioral economics not only contributes new modeling instruments but, through its documentation of rationality violations or “anomalies,” can provide a rich source of intuitions and insights into consumer psychology as well.",Drazen Prelec,,0

A key feature of recommendation data is that few customers rate more than a handful of items. Extant models take missing recommendation rating data to be missing completely at random, implicitly presuming that they lack meaningful patterns or utility in improving ratings accuracy. For the widely studied EachMovie data, the authors find that missing data are strongly nonignorable. Recommendation quality is improved substantially by jointly modeling “selection” and “ratings,” both whether and how an item is rated. Accounting for missing ratings and various sources of heterogeneity offers a rich portrait of which items are rated well, which are rated at all, and how these processes are intertwined, while reducing holdout error by 10% or more.

When the regulatory goal serviced by the target matched (conflicted with) the regulatory goal serviced by the prime, participants indicated higher (lower) purchase intent (Experiment 1) and more favorable evaluations of the target brand (Experiment 2).

In this article, the authors propose an alternative model. Building on the need to belong and the need for accuracy, the authors predict that enjoyment from sharing stimuli depends on consumers' perceived interpersonal agreements about the shared stimuli, such that congruence of opinions enhances and incongruence of opinions diminishes the enjoyment of the shared experience. The results from three experiments support the authors' predictions and indicate that under some circumstances, social influence can operate in opposite directions on judgments of shared stimuli and on the enjoyment of sharing them.","Rajagopal Raghunathan, Kim Corfman",,0

Corrections to these default judgments occur when processing is thoughtful. These results underscore the idea that culture does not exert a constant, unwavering effect on consumer judgments.

In experimental settings, in which consumers are presented with simple descriptions of product offerings, continuous distributions of heterogeneity, such as the multivariate normal, provide a useful representation of preference. However, in more complex cases in which respondents have value for only a few of the benefits associated with an offering or cognitive constraints that result in selective attention to a subset of the information available, continuous distributions of heterogeneity do not reflect the possibility that a subset of the variables has nonzero effect sizes for different respondents. Identifying which attributes are used in a brand choice decision is closely related to the statistical procedure of variable selection. This article extends variable selection methods to accommodate heterogeneity across consumers and data contexts, conditions frequently encountered in marketing studies.

Third, the authors argue that marketing researchers should make the means of scale items an explicit component of measurement analysis and should test for the invariance of item loadings and intercepts as a prerequisite for meaningful comparisons of scale means across samples and over time. To illustrate the benefits of the proposed procedure, the authors present an extended application of the model to the constructs of brand loyalty and deal proneness.","Hans Baumgartner, Jan-Benedict E.M.

The model consists of a vector autoregression that is rewritten in error correction format, which allows the authors to disentangle the immediate effects from the dynamic effects. In a second level of the model, the immediate price elasticities, the cumulative promotional price elasticity, and the long-term regular price elasticity are correlated with various brand-specific and category-specific characteristics. The model is applied to seven years of data on weekly sales of 100 different brands in 25 product categories. The authors find many significant moderating effects on the elasticity of price promotions. Brands in categories that are characterized by high price differentiation and that constitute a lower share of budget are less sensitive to price discounts. Deep price discounts increase the immediate price sensitivity of customers. The authors also find significant effects for the cumulative elasticity. The immediate effect of a regular price change is often close to zero. The long-term effect of such a regular price decrease usually amounts to an increase in sales. This is especially true in categories that are characterized by a large price dispersion and frequent price promotions and for hedonic, nonperishable products.","Dennis Fok, Csilla Horváth, Richard Paap,...",,0

The Periodicity of Pricing,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.3.477,01-Aug-06,01-Aug-06,43,3,477,493,"Retail pricing data combine multiple decisions (e.g., regular pricing and discounting) that are possibly made by multiple decision makers (e.g., retailers and manufacturers). For example, temporary price reductions (high-frequency price changes) can be used to price discriminate in the short run, whereas regular price adjustments (low-frequency price changes) might reflect changes in long-term costs or demand. Time disaggregation cannot disentangle these factors, because frequency aggregation exists even when data are analyzed at the lowest possible level of temporal aggregation. Because little is known about the nature of pricing interactions across various planning cycles, this article develops several empirical generalizations about the role of periodicity in pricing. Using week-store stockkeeping-unit-level price data in 35 grocery categories, the authors find that (1) cross-brand correlation in prices occurs at multiple planning horizons, and the planning horizon of the predominant interaction does not typically coincide with the sampling rate of the data; (2) aggregating pricing interactions across frequencies obscures distinct and different interactions; (3) pricing interactions are related to category- and brand-specific factors, such as mean interpurchase times; (4) regular price changes explain most of the variation in prices; and (5) periodicity can affect inferences about the nature of competition within a category. The authors conclude by discussing several practical marketing applications for which marketing decisions across frequencies have relevance.","Bart J. Bronnenberg, Carl F. Mela, William Boulding",,0
From Invention to Innovation: Conversion Ability in Product Development,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.3.494,01-Aug-06,01-Aug-06,43,3,494,508,"The ability to convert inputs into outputs is a critical determinant of success in many fields of endeavor. In this research, the authors study the ability of firms to convert ideas into products, that is, their conversion ability. Specifically, they address the question, Why are some firms better at conversion than others? In contrast to much of the existing literature, the authors propose that a strong focus on speed and on generating many ideas may actually hurt firms by lowering their conversion ability. The authors test their arguments on data between 1960 and 2001 from a cross-national sample of pharmaceutical firms. They find that firms vary widely in their ability to convert promising drug ideas into launched drugs. Firms with the highest conversion ability are those that (1) focus on a moderate number of ideas, in areas of importance, and in areas in which they have expertise and (2) deliberate for a moderate length of time on promising ideas.","Rajesh Chandy, Brigitte Hopstaken, Om Narasimhan,...",,0

Do Slotting Allowances Enhance Efficiency or Hinder Competition?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.2.137,01-May-06,01-May-06,43,2,137,155,"Slotting allowances are lump-sum payments by manufacturers to retailers for stocking new products. The economic rationale for slotting allowances is controversial. Supporters argue that slotting allowances are efficiency enhancing; critics argue that they are anticompetitive. However, there is no empirical research on this issue because of the difficulty in obtaining data about these transactions. Using data on all new products that were offered to one retailer for a period of nine months, the authors empirically investigate support for the alternative rationales for slotting allowances. The analysis indicates that, in general, there is more support for the efficiency theories than for the anticompetitive theories. The authors find that slotting allowances (1) efficiently allocate scarce retail shelf space, (2) help balance the risk of new product failure between manufacturers and retailers, (3) help manufacturers signal private information about potential success of new products, and (4) widen retail distribution for manufacturers by mitigating retail competition. The authors find little support for the anticompetitive rationales in the data. The empirical support for the efficiency rationales suggests that the Federal Trade Commission was correct in being circumspect about banning slotting allowances outright.","K. Sudhir, Vithala R.

Price Matching by Vertically Differentiated Retailers: Theory and Evidence,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.2.156,01-May-06,01-May-06,43,2,156,167,"This research examines vertically differentiated retailers' incentives to offer price-matching guarantees. It suggests that offering and not offering a price-matching guarantee are both signals of a retailer's service-price profile, a way of branding the retailer to uninformed consumers. The signals are made credible and costless by the presence of informed consumers. The authors show that when the service differentiation is large enough, only low-service retailers offer price-matching guarantees. Data from a sample of Canadian retail chains support this prediction. In addition, larger retail chains are more likely to offer price-matching guarantees than smaller chains, and competition has an interactive effect with service. As the intensity of competition a chain faces increases, lower-service retailers are even more likely to use a guarantee, and higher-service retailers are less likely to do so, suggesting that price-matching guarantees are competitive tools, not collusive tools, as the literature has often implied.","Sridhar Moorthy, Xubing Zhang",,0
How the Internet Lowers Prices: Evidence from Matched Survey and Automobile Transaction Data,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.2.168,01-May-06,01-May-06,43,2,168,181,"Although research has shown that the Internet has lowered the prices in some established industries, little is known about how use of the Internet lowers prices. The authors address this issue for the automobile retailing industry with matched survey and transaction data on 1500 car purchases in California. They show that the Internet lowers prices for two distinct reasons: First, the Internet informs consumers about dealers' invoice prices. Second, the referral process of online buying services helps consumers obtain lower prices. The combined information and referral price effects are −1.5%, or 22% of dealers' average gross vehicle profit. The authors also find that the benefits of gathering information differ by consumer type. Buyers who have a high disutility of bargaining but who have collected information on the specific car they eventually purchase pay 1.5% less than they otherwise would. In contrast, buyers who like the bargaining process do not benefit from such information.","Florian Zettelmeyer, Fiona Scott Morton, Jorge Silva-Risso",,6
Factors Affecting Web Site Visit Duration: A Cross-Domain Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.2.182,01-May-06,01-May-06,43,2,182,194,"In this study, the authors examine factors that affect Web site visit duration, including user demographics, text and graphics content, type of site, presence of functionality features, advertising content, and the number of previous visits. The authors use a random effects model to determine the impact of these factors on site duration and the number of pages viewed. The proposed method accounts for three distinct sources of heterogeneity that arise from differences among people, Web sites, and visit occasions to the same Web site by the same person. The model is fit using one month of user-centric panel data, and it encompasses the 50 most popular sites in a market. The results show that, in general, older people and women visit Web sites for a longer period. Some surprising results are revealed in an examination of interactions between these demographic and site characteristic variables. For example, sites with higher levels of advertising usually result in lower visit duration, but this is not the case for older people. The model also yields insights into the relative importance of different sources of heterogeneity in visit duration; heterogeneity in visit occasions dominates over individual-level and Web site-specific heterogeneity.","Peter J.

For example, a 35% acquisition discount results in customers with about one-half the long-term value of non-promotionally acquired customers.",Michael Lewis,,0
Defection Detection: Measuring and Understanding the Predictive Accuracy of Customer Churn Models,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.2.204,01-May-06,01-May-06,43,2,204,211,"This article provides a descriptive analysis of how methodological factors contribute to the accuracy of customer churn predictive models. The study is based on a tournament in which both academics and practitioners downloaded data from a publicly available Web site, estimated a model, and made predictions on two validation databases. The results suggest several important findings. First, methods do matter. The differences observed in predictive accuracy across submissions could change the profitability of a churn management campaign by hundreds of thousands of dollars. Second, models have staying power. They suffer very little decrease in performance if they are used to predict churn for a database compiled three months after the calibration data. Third, researchers use a variety of modeling “approaches,” characterized by variables such as estimation technique, variable selection procedure, number of variables included, and time allocated to steps in the model-building process. The authors find important differences in performance among these approaches and discuss implications for both researchers and practitioners.","Scott A. Neslin, Sunil Gupta, Wagner Kamakura,...",,3

Yet there is evidence that many users prefer a flat rate even though their billing rate would be lower with a pay-per-use tariff (flat-rate bias), and some users prefer a pay-per-use tariff even though they would save money with a flat rate (pay-per-use bias). The authors conduct four empirical analyses based on three different data sets. They show that the flat-rate bias is more important and has a greater regularity and time persistence than the pay-per-use bias. They classify potential causes of the flat-rate bias as “insurance effect,” “taxi meter effect,” “convenience effect,” and “overestimation effect” and show that the insurance, the taxi meter, and the overestimation effects lead to a flat-rate bias. They provide evidence that underestimation of usage is a major cause of the pay-per-use bias. They show that the flat-rate bias does not significantly increase customer churn and thus results in a short- and long-term profit increase. In contrast, the pay-per-use bias largely increases churn so that in the long run, the additional short-term profit is offset by higher churn.","Anja Lambrecht, Bernd Skiera",,26
The Impact of Standards Competition on Consumers: Effectiveness of Product Information and Advertising Formats,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.2.224,01-May-06,01-May-06,43,2,224,236,"Compared with other markets, those with competing technological standards exhibit certain fundamental characteristics that make a consumer's decision to adopt a new product more risky and more complex. This article examines how standards competition affects consumer behavior, an issue that has been relatively neglected by previous research in this area. The results show that consumers depend on different types of information in their adoption decisions and respond differently to advertising. Specifically, the authors find that standards competition motivates consumers to pay more attention to information that is comparative in nature. Thus, information about the relative (absolute) performance of a product has a stronger (weaker) impact on a product's share in markets with standards competition (Study 1). Standards competition also moderates the effectiveness of different advertising formats: It strengthens the effect of comparative advertisements but weakens the effect of noncomparative advertisements (Study 2). As a result, two commonly observed drawbacks of comparative advertisements—negative attitude toward the ad and source confusion—disappear in the presence of standards competition (Study 2), and comparative advertisements even induce greater confidence in the advertised brand (Study 3). Finally, in the presence of standards competition, the superiority of comparative advertisements is stronger when the advertised brand has a disadvantage in terms of brand familiarity than when it has an advantage (Study 3). This research takes a step toward a better understanding of these important but underexplored issues and provides managerial insights for firms that launch new products in markets with competing standards.","Amitav Chakravarti, Jinhong Xie",,0

Furthermore, the authors obtain empirical findings in two major areas: First, variation in similarity ratings can be explained by the advertisements' features, a finding of potential importance for advertisement construction. Second, some, but not all, executional elements that have been shown (in the literature) to drive recall and persuasion are effective at driving perceptions of similarity. This is of practical importance because managers want their advertisements not only to be liked and remembered but also (possibly) to be perceived as similar (or dissimilar) to those for other products. In particular, an understanding of which items drive which constructs (recall and persuasion, or similarity) can contribute to a more effective overall marketing strategy.","David A.

The authors show that a prior choice, which activates and boosts a positive self-concept, subsequently licenses the choice of a more self-indulgent option. The authors propose that licensing can operate by committing to a virtuous act in a preceding choice, which reduces negative self-attributions associated with the purchase of relative luxuries. Five studies demonstrate the proposed licensing effect of a prior commitment to a virtuous act on subsequent choice. Consistent with the authors' theory, the preference for an indulgent option diminishes if the licensing task is attributed to an external motivation. The authors also report a mediation analysis in support of their theoretical explanation that the licensing effect operates by providing a temporary boost in the relevant self-concept.","Uzma Khan, Ravi Dhar",,171

The authors analyze the data with a dynamic simultaneous-equations model of the drivers and the interrelationships of the behaviors of movie audiences, studios, and exhibitors. Specifically, the authors test for the attenuating role of third-party information sources, such as critics' review consensus and cumulative word of mouth, on the strength of the two aforementioned signals. The authors find evidence of such an effect both at the release phase across movies and over the postrelease phase for any movie. Notably, they hypothesize and show that sequels and advertising expenditures have a positive interaction effect on box office revenues. This is an important finding because though most firms use multiple signals for their products, empirical work on the interaction of two or more signals is rare.

How Regulatory Fit Affects Value in Consumer Choices and Opinions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.1.1,01-Feb-06,01-Feb-06,43,1,1,10,"Regulatory fit occurs when the manner of peoples' engagement in an activity sustains their current goal orientation or concerns with that activity. It is proposed that regulatory fit changes the significance of consumers' reactions to something, including the perceived monetary value of a choice they have made or the persuasiveness of a message they have received. When there is a fit, people engage more strongly in and “feel right” about what they are doing, and subsequent evaluative reactions (positive or negative) can be intensified by this fit experience. The fit experience is shown to influence the strength of value experiences independent of hedonic experiences. The authors discuss how the fit effect on value is distinct from other factors that affect value, such as relevancy, matching, hedonic mood, and arousal. Using prior research on this topic, this article summarizes the current state of knowledge about how fit influences value and offers new ideas for further research.","Tamar Avnet, E.

Second, the authors discuss possible boundary conditions of regulatory fit effects, highlighting the apparent paradoxical role of involvement. They suggest that the antecedents that give rise to regulatory fit (e.g., lowered motivation) can differ from its consequences (e.g., increased motivation). Third, the authors discuss broader implications of regulatory fit, proposing three possible mechanisms by which regulatory fit can lead to improved physical health and discussing the degree to which the just-right feeling plays a role in goal-sustaining experiences related to subjective well-being (e.g., flow).","Jennifer L.

Building on this hypothesis, the authors generate new propositions for the human psychology of rewards. They test these propositions using field experiments, secondary customer data, paper-and-pencil problems, and Tobit and logit models. The key findings indicate that (1) participants in a real café reward program purchase coffee more frequently the closer they are to earning a free coffee; (2) Internet users who rate songs in return for reward certificates visit the rating Web site more often, rate more songs per visit, and persist longer in the rating effort as they approach the reward goal; (3) the illusion of progress toward the goal induces purchase acceleration (e.g., customers who receive a 12-stamp coffee card with 2 preexisting “bonus” stamps complete the 10 required purchases faster than customers who receive a “regular” 10-stamp card); and (4) a stronger tendency to accelerate toward the goal predicts greater retention and faster reengagement in the program. The conceptualization and empirical findings are captured by a parsimonious goal-distance model, in which effort investment is a function of the proportion of original distance remaining to the goal. In addition, using statistical and experimental controls, the authors rule out alternative explanations for the observed goal gradients.

A Direct Approach to Data Fusion,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.1.73,01-Feb-06,01-Feb-06,43,1,73,83,"The generic data fusion problem is to make inferences about the joint distribution of two sets of variables without any direct observations of the joint distribution. Instead, information is available only for each set separately along with some other set of common variables. The standard approach to data fusion creates a fused data set with the variables of interest and the common variables. This article develops an approach that directly estimates the joint distribution of just the variables of interest. For the case of either discrete or continuous variables, the approach yields a solution that can be implemented with standard statistical models and software. In typical marketing applications, the common variables are psychographic or demographic variables, and the variables to be fused involve media viewing and product purchase. For this example, the approach directly estimates the joint distribution of media viewing and product purchase without including the common variables. This is the object required for marketing decisions. In marketing applications, fusion of discrete variables is required. The authors develop a method for relaxing the assumption of conditional independence for this case. They illustrate their approach with product-purchase and media-viewing data from a large survey of British consumers.","Zvi Gilula, Robert E. McCulloch, Peter E. Rossi",,0

In an analytical model of competing manufacturers and competing multiproduct retailers, the authors show that manufacturers may actually experience increased profits when a retailer gains an exogenous cost advantage over its rival retailer. Potential channel efficiencies exist when retailing costs are reduced. The authors illustrate that channel transactions based on bilateral bargaining capture these efficiencies by transferring market share to the more efficient retailer, thus increasing channel profits. In a bargaining relationship between a manufacturer and a retailer, the manufacturer realizes some of these enhanced efficiencies.

The authors model the probability of a current customer making a purchase in any given week (since the last purchase) with a survival model that uses a flexible, piecewise exponential hazard function. The advertising covariates are purely advertising variables and advertising/individual browsing variables. The model is cast in a hierarchical Bayesian framework, which enables the authors to obtain individual advertising response parameters. The results show that the number of exposures, number of Web sites, and number of pages all have a positive effect on repeat purchase probabilities, whereas the number of unique creatives has a negative effect. Returns from targeting are the highest for the number of advertising exposures. The findings also add to the general advertising literature by showing that advertising affects the purchase behavior of current (versus new) customers.","Puneet Manchanda, Jean-Pierre Dubé, Khim Yong Goh,...",,6
How Customer Self-Determination Influences Relational Marketing Outcomes: Evidence from Longitudinal Field Studies,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.43.1.109,01-Feb-06,01-Feb-06,43,1,109,120,"This article examines the role of customers' self-determination, defined as a person's perception of joining a firm on his or her own initiative versus being induced to join, in influencing relational outcomes for firms.

This article also examines how customers' self-determination interacts with two types of relational marketing programs: reminder coupons, which consumers view as relatively more controlling, and relational rewards, which they view as relatively more informative of their value to the firm. The results reveal that sending a stylized reminder coupon to encourage repeat purchase has negative effects (Study 3) and that automatic enrollment in a relational rewards program has positive effects on relational behaviors of self-determined customers (Study 4). Firm-determined customers are less influenced by rewards in both cases.

However, there is considerable disagreement about how life stages should be defined and how households progress through these stages. Existing studies use a priori definitions, which are tested on a cross-sectional survey of households collected at a single point in time and thus cannot reveal the real dynamics of the household life cycle. The Panel Study of Income Dynamics provides longitudinal data on household composition in the United States for a period of 34 years; the authors use this to identify empirically the most typical stages and paths that U.S. households have followed since 1968. They develop a hidden Markov model in which the stages of the household life cycle are taken as latent, unobservable states that are uncovered from the manifest household demographic profiles over the 34 years, assuming that households evolve through these latent stages following a first-order Markov process.

Placebo Effects of Marketing Actions: Consumers May Get What They Pay For,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.2005.42.4.383,01-Nov-05,01-Nov-05,42,4,383,393,"The authors demonstrate that marketing actions, such as pricing, can alter the actual efficacy of products to which they are applied. These placebo effects stem from activation of expectancies about the efficacy of the product, a process that appears not to be conscious. In three experiments, the authors show that consumers who pay a discounted price for a product (e.g., an energy drink thought to increase mental acuity) may derive less actual benefit from consuming this product (e.g., they are able to solve fewer puzzles) than consumers who purchase and consume the exact same product but pay its regular price. The studies consistently support the role of expectancies in mediating this placebo effect. The authors conclude with a discussion of theoretical, managerial, and public policy implications of the findings.","Baba Shiv, Ziv Carmon, Dan Ariely",,48

RFM and CLV: Using Iso-Value Curves for Customer Base Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.2005.42.4.415,01-Nov-05,01-Nov-05,42,4,415,430,"The authors present a new model that links the well-known RFM (recency, frequency, and monetary value) paradigm with customer lifetime value (CLV). Although previous researchers have made a conceptual link, none has presented a formal model with a well-grounded behavioral ”story.” Key to this analysis is the notion of ”iso-value” curves, which enable the grouping of individual customers who have different purchasing histories but similar future valuations. Iso-value curves make it easy to visualize the interactions and trade-offs among the RFM measures and CLV. The stochastic model is based on the Pareto/NBD framework to capture the flow of transactions over time and a gamma-gamma submodel for spend per transaction. The authors conduct several holdout tests to demonstrate the validity of the model's underlying components and then use it to estimate the total CLV for a cohort of new customers of the online music site CDNOW.

Feature Fatigue: When Product Capabilities Become Too Much of a Good Thing,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.2005.42.4.431,01-Nov-05,01-Nov-05,42,4,431,442,"As technology advances, it becomes more feasible to load products with a large number of features, each of which individually might be perceived as useful. However, too many features can make a product overwhelming for consumers and difficult to use. Three studies examine how consumers balance their desires for capability and usability when they evaluate products and how these desires shift over time. Because consumers give more weight to capability and less weight to usability before use than after use, they tend to choose overly complex products that do not maximize their satisfaction when they use them, resulting in ”feature fatigue.” An analytical model based on these results provides additional insights into the feature fatigue effect. This model shows that choosing the number of features that maximizes initial choice results in the inclusion of too many features, potentially decreasing customer lifetime value. As the emphasis on future sales increases, the optimal number of features decreases. The results suggest that firms should consider having a larger number of more specialized products, each with a limited number of features, rather than loading all possible features into one product.","Debora Viana Thompson, Rebecca W.

The authors model each group's contribution as the number of daily buyers times their average expenditures. The model also includes the number of nonbuyers because they may return as customers. Moreover, nonbuyers may influence the expenditures of other customers through crowding effects, and they use personnel time. Model application to two years of daily data from six clothing stores reveals that the number of nonmembers who buy is much more responsive to price discounts than the number of members who buy. Thus, the decomposition of the promotional revenue bump is strongly moderated by the percentage price discount and the communication mode: direct mail to members only and door-to-door flyers to members and nonmembers.","Harald J.

Two Roads to Updating Brand Personality Impressions: Trait versus Evaluative Inferencing,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.2005.42.4.458,01-Nov-05,01-Nov-05,42,4,458,469,"This research examines the dynamic process of inference updating.

Notably, nonchronics (those for whom the trait is not accessible) also update their initial inferences, but they do so on the basis of the evaluative implications of new information. The framework adds to the inference-making literature by uncovering two distinct paths of inference updating and by emphasizing the moderating role of trait accessibility. The findings have direct implications for marketers attempting to understand the construction of brand personality, and they emphasize the constantly evolving nature of brand perceptions and the notion that both the consumer and the marketer have important roles to play in this process.","Gita Venkataramani Johar, Jaideep Sengupta, Jennifer L.

This integrated framework is based on a single, latent, time-varying construct of consumer willingness to bid, which bidders have and update for a particular auction item over the course of the auction duration. Using a database of notebook auctions from one of the largest Internet auction sites in Korea, the authors demonstrate that this general (yet parsimonious) model captures the key behavioral aspects of bidding behavior. Furthermore, the authors provide a valuable tool for managers at auction sites to conduct their customer relationship management efforts, which require them to evaluate the ”goodness” of the listed auction items (whether people bid) and the goodness of the potential bidders (who bids, when they bid, and how much they bid).","Young-Hoon Park, Eric T.

Probabilistic Subset-Conjunctive Models for Heterogeneous Consumers,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.2005.42.4.483,01-Nov-05,01-Nov-05,42,4,483,494,"The authors propose two generalizations of conjunctive and disjunctive screening rules. First, they relax the requirement that an acceptable alternative must be satisfactory on one criterion (disjunctive) or on all criteria (conjunctive). Second, they relax the assumption that consumers make deterministic judgments when evaluating alternatives. They combine the two generalizations into a probabilistic subset-conjunctive rule, which allows consumers to use any number or subset of decision criteria when screening alternatives and permits them to be uncertain about the acceptability of attribute levels. These two features allow for a screening process that is uncertain and more flexible than the deterministic conjunctive and disjunctive rules currently described in the literature. The authors describe a latent-class method for the estimation of the subset-conjunctive rules and the attribute-level consideration probabilities using either consideration or choice data. Applications using both types of data suggest that the proposed models predict as well as linear models do; can make different predictions of consideration, choice, and market shares; and provide insights into consumer decision processes that are different from those obtained with linear models.","Kamel Jedidi, Rajeev Kohli",,0
Does Loving a Brand Mean Loving Its Products? the Role of Brand-Elicited Affect in Brand Extension Evaluations,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.2005.42.4.495,01-Nov-05,01-Nov-05,42,4,495,506,"Three studies examine the influence of brand-elicited affect on consumers' evaluations of brand extensions. When a brand spontaneously elicits affective reactions, consumers appear to form an initial impression of the brand's new extension based on these reactions. The affect that they experience for other reasons and attribute to the brand can influence this impression as well. Their later evaluations of the extension are then based on this impression. This is true regardless of the similarity between the extension and the core brand. These results contrast with evidence that affect influences brand extension evaluations through its mediating impact on perceptions of core-extension similarity. This latter influence occurs only when consumers are explicitly asked to estimate the extension's similarity to the core before they evaluate it.","Catherine W.M. Yeung, Robert S. Wyer, Jr.",,0
How Potential Conflict Drives Channel Structure: Concurrent (Direct and Indirect) Channels,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.2005.42.4.507,01-Nov-05,01-Nov-05,42,4,507,515,"The authors study business-to-business manufacturers' simultaneous usage of vertically integrated (direct) and third-party (indirect) channels of distribution to serve one geographical market (possibly comprising several market segments) with the same product line. Most theoretical approaches to vertical integration of the distribution function pose the classic question of whether to forward integrate or use independent entities. Having concurrent channels means doing both. This phenomenon is poorly understood, even though it has been growing rapidly. The authors argue that under certain circumstances, it is impossible for manufacturers to prevent channel types from competing with each other, either because both channel types contact the same customer or because the customer sets them in competition against each other. The authors argue that when these situations are frequent or more consequential for the parties involved, firms reduce their usage of concurrent channels to prevent severe channel conflict. The authors posit five such circumstances. Using original data from prominent manufacturers operating in competitive markets worldwide, they model usage of both types of channels to cover one geography with the same products. They find substantial support for their model. Furthermore, in a subset of firms that use both channel types in the same market, they model the degree to which direct and indirect channels compete destructively against each other when contacting the same customers. The authors find that suppliers reduce such behavior by incurring costs to differentiate each channel's offerings, setting out ”rules of engagement,” and compensating both channel types when either one makes a sale.","Alberto Sa Vinhas, Erin Anderson",,0
An Empirical Analysis of Price Discrimination Mechanisms and Retailer Profitability,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.2005.42.4.516,01-Nov-05,01-Nov-05,42,4,516,524,"Retailers typically engage in some form of price discrimination to increase profitability. In this article, the authors compare the impact on retailer profitability of two price discrimination mechanisms: quantity discounts based on package size (second-degree price discrimination) and store-level pricing or micromarketing (third-degree price discrimination). Whereas the latter has been well addressed in the marketing literature, there is limited empirical research on the use of quantity discounts for price discrimination. Using store-level sales data, the authors estimate a structural demand model, accounting for parameter heterogeneity and price endogeneity. They combine the parameter estimates with a model of retailer pricing to conduct optimal pricing and profitability simulations under several scenarios, ranging from constraining the retailer not to engage in any form of price discrimination to the least restrictive scenario of setting nonlinear price schedules specific to each store. The pricing simulations enable the decomposition of profitability as a result of the different forms of price discrimination. Profits are greatest when retailers combine second- and third-degree price discrimination. The authors find that the ability to engage in second-degree price discrimination contributes more to retailer profitability than does third-degree price discrimination.","Romana J. Khan, Dipak C.

The authors propose an alternative model in which consumers use only “ordered value” information; that is, utilities are functions only of the relative orderings of the attributes' values across alternatives (e.g., choices depend only on the price ordering and not on actual prices). The ordered value model is attractive because it fits well with psychological evidence that consumers often favor decision mechanisms that are cognitively less demanding. Using a supermarket shopper panel data set, the authors evaluate four models in which (1) all consumers use actual values; (2) all consumers use ordered values; (3) some consumers use actual values all the time, and some consumers use ordered values all the time; and (4) all consumers use both actual values and ordered values but with different propensities. In the analysis, the ordered value model finds stronger support than the actual value model: Model 1 outperforms Model 2; in the two hybrid choice models (Models 3 and 4), ordered value processing is more prevalent than actual value processing. These results suggest that consumers in some product categories engage more heavily in ordered value processing than in actual value processing.","Anand V. Bodapati, Aimee Drolet",,0

In three studies, the authors measure discrepancies between requests for available ethical attribute information and actual use of the same attribute in a conjoint task. In both between-subjects and within-subjects designs, the authors show that consumers (1) underrequest ethical attribute information and (2) are especially likely to show request/use inconsistency if they care about the underlying ethical issue. Negative emotions, especially the avoidance of anger, appear to drive this willful ignorance. These results add to the growing literature on avoidance mechanisms and consumer decision making and may shed light on when ethical attributes do (and do not) play a role in actual purchase behavior.","Kristine R.

The authors expect that the indirect effect is relatively larger in the early, postlaunch stages. They develop a structural model of demand that allows for such temporal differences in the roles of marketing communication. They use a random coefficients discrete choice model with a Bayesian learning process to model physician learning about new drugs and market-level data for the prescription antihistamines category. They find that marketing communication has a primarily indirect effect 6–14 months after introduction but that the direct effect subsequently dominates.

Specifically, they predict that people from Western cultures are relatively less patient and therefore discount the future to a greater degree than do people from Eastern cultures, and thus Westerners value immediate consumption relatively more. Furthermore, on the basis of regulatory focus theory, the authors predict that when Easterners are faced with the threat of a delay in receiving a product (i.e., a prevention loss), they are more impatient, whereas when Westerners are faced with the threat of not being able to enjoy a product early (i.e., a promotion loss), their impatience increases. This enhanced impatience manifests in preference for expedited consumption of a product purchased online in two studies. In both studies, the authors used a priming methodology on “bicultural” Singaporean participants; the results support the predictions.

The author offers an explanation of how such advertisements can construct a credible price image even with this vagueness. When retailers must incur costs in the process of selling a product, advertising low prices to lure potential consumers can backfire. This is because attracting too many consumers who are less likely to purchase the retailer's higher-priced products on the basis of vague promises imposes unwanted selling costs but yields little extra revenue. Therefore, a store with a relatively high selling cost will be dissuaded from attempting to use such a strategy. The author shows analytically that such advertising can be credible only when there is a substantial difference in retailers' costs or when the selling cost is high.",Jiwoong Shin,,0

Study 1 shows that lowering search costs diminishes choice quality in an ordered environment. Study 2 shows that presenting consumers with the top 50 rather than the top 15 recommendations has the same effect.

Two studies investigate which (if either) of these background music meanings influence perceptions of an advertised product and when. Findings suggest that people who engage in nonintensive processing are insensitive to either type of meaning.

This article tests Ghosh and John's (1999) strategizing calculus model that purports to close this gap. The core organizing principle of this model is a three-way fit among firm resources, investments, and governance that yields the highest net receipts. From this principle, the authors derive predictions and test them using data from 193 original equipment manufacturers that engage independent component suppliers. The data show that investments must be aligned with more complete contract terms (e.g., fixed prices, “hard” designs) to yield cost reduction outcomes for all firms. However, investments must be aligned with more incomplete contracts (e.g., cost-plus prices, “soft” designs) to yield end-product enhancement outcomes, but only for firms with relatively small downstream market margins. Firms with larger downstream market margins find that the previous alignment reduces end-product enhancements. These results are robust to checks for common method bias and alternative estimation procedures.

The Impact of the Prechoice Process on Product Returns,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.2005.42.3.358,01-Aug-05,01-Aug-05,42,3,358,367,"This article introduces a framework to help researchers understand the mechanisms underlying product returns. The framework draws on research in consumer choice, consumer memory, and attitude stability to predict how the process that consumers go through at a predecisional stage affects their postpurchase behavior. The likelihood of product returns is considered contingent on the amount and nature of cognitive responses generated during the choice process. In Study 1, the authors focus on the impact of the nature of cognitive responses and show that the generation of responses of a different nature while choosing directly affects the likelihood of choice reversal. The comparative versus non-comparative nature of thoughts generated influences their diagnosticity and, accordingly, their impact on product returns when consumers are exposed to disconfirming information. In Study 2, the authors draw on the inoculation theory to manipulate the number of prechoice thoughts. They find that when faced with disconfirming information favoring a new brand, inoculated consumers who are presented with choice alternatives sequentially are less likely to return a brand than consumers who are exposed solely to positive information about the chosen brand at a prepurchase stage.","Nada Nasr Bechwati, Wendy Schneier Siegal",,7
Estimating a Stockkeeping-Unit-Level Brand Choice Model that Combines Household Panel Data and Store Data,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.2005.42.3.368,01-Aug-05,01-Aug-05,42,3,368,379,"The marketing literature has addressed the issues of heterogeneity and endogeneity when estimating a choice model with household-level panel data. When using these data at the stockkeeping unit or the Universal Product Code level, choices for each item in each of the time periods under consideration cannot be observed. Without such information, it is difficult to control for item- and time period–specific unmeasured characteristics because there is no information on alternatives during those periods in which they are not purchased by any of the panelists. In general, when a product category has many alternatives, each with fairly small shares, the household sample may not contain sufficient choices for each alternative, thus negatively affecting the ability to control for endogeneity with household data. In contrast, because aggregate store-level data (for those stores in which the panel makes purchases) are the aggregation of purchases by all households visiting the stores, the data contain the time period–specific item-level information required to account for endogeneity as long as each item has some sales in each time period. Given the relative merits of household data to estimate the distribution of heterogeneity and store-level data to address the endogeneity problem, the authors propose an integrated estimation procedure that uses the information in both sources. They provide empirical results from their model using data on the fabric softener market.

A few open questions are whether loss aversion is a stable feature of preference, whether it is an expression of fear, and what are its properties.",Colin Camerer,,0

In this comment to Novemsky and Kahneman's article, the authors consider the new empirical results that involve probabilistic buying and selling, suggesting caution in generalizing the results to nonprobabilistic commerce. The authors expand Novemsky and Kahneman's summary by exploring two critical constructs that help define the boundaries of loss aversion: emotional attachment and cognitive perspective. Emotional attachment alters loss aversion by moderating the degree to which parting with an item involves a loss, whereas shifts in cognitive perspective explain why items typically viewed as a loss are given more or less weight. The goal is to use these constructs to characterize more specifically contexts in which losses loom larger than gains and to suggest specific ways that research into loss aversion could evolve.","Dan Ariely, Joel Huber, Klaus Wertenbroch",,3

New Empirical Generalizations on the Determinants of Price Elasticity,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.42.2.141.62296,01-May-05,01-May-05,42,2,141,156,"The importance of pricing decisions for firms has fueled an extensive stream of research on price elasticities. In an influential meta-analytical study, Tellis (1988) summarized price elasticity research findings until 1986. However, empirical generalizations on price elasticity require modifications because of (1) changes in market characteristics (i.e., characteristics of brands, product categories, and economic conditions) and (2) changes in the research methodology used to assess price elasticities. Therefore, the authors present a meta-analysis of price elasticity with new empirical generalizations on its determinants. Across a set of 1851 price elasticities based on 81 studies, the average price elasticity is −2.62. A salient finding is that over the past four decades, sales elasticities have significantly increased in magnitude, whereas share and choice elasticities have remained fairly constant. The authors find that accommodating price endogeneity has a strong (magnitude-increasing) impact on price elasticities. A striking null result is that accounting for heterogeneity does not affect elasticities significantly. The authors also present an analysis that explains the difference between their findings and Tellis's findings, and they indicate which new price elasticity studies are most desirable.","Tammo H.A.

In particular, the authors find that distraction actually increases subsequent choice of the sampled food, a finding that is contrary to what industry experts predict. The authors propose a dual-process model of somatosensory experiences to account for the findings. In line with the model, the findings suggest that the ultimate pleasure that a consumer derives from the taste of a food sample depends on two components, an informational component and an affective component. Furthermore, the findings suggest that distraction affects the subsequent choice of the sampled item by increasing (decreasing) the impact of the affective component (informational component) on subsequent choice.","Stephen M.

Recovering Stockkeeping-Unit-Level Preferences and Response Sensitivities from Market Share Models Estimated on Item Aggregates,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.42.2.169.62294,01-May-05,01-May-05,42,2,169,182,"The authors propose a new approach to obtaining stockkeeping-unit (SKU)-level preferences and response sensitivities. The authors distinguish an attribute-level model, in which the unit of analysis is the market share for an alternative created by aggregation (e.g., Colgate toothpaste), from a truly disaggregate SKU-level model, and they establish an analytical relationship between parameters that they obtain from the two models. The authors show that SKU-level parameters can be recovered by calculation from estimated attribute-level parameters, circumventing the need for direct estimation of the more complex SKU-level model. They calibrate the store data market share model using 98 weeks of data for ten brands and 168 SKUs of toothpaste. Rather than estimate 168 preference parameters (when there is an “outside” alternative in addition to the 168 “inside” ones), it is only necessary to estimate ten brand-preference parameters from which the 168 parameters can be computed, as long as share and marketing-mix data are available at the SKU level. Covariate effects, such as marketing-mix response parameters, can be recovered in a similar fashion. Holdout tests demonstrate superior predictive performance, and the authors discuss implications for the derivation of elasticities for new SKU introductions.","David R.

A counterextension is a brand extension that is launched into Category A by Brand 2 that belongs to Category B in a reciprocal direction to a launch of a previous extension into Category B by Brand 1 that belongs to Category A. The results from five studies show that customers evaluate a counterextension more favorably when the preceding extension is a success rather than a failure. Furthermore, the evaluation of the counterextension is superior if it is launched by a major brand, especially if the previous successful extension was also launched by a major brand. Finally, a successful extension indirectly dilutes a brand and results in a greater loss in choice share to a counterextension than does a failed extension.

The premise is that household preferences for attributes that are common across categories are likely to be correlated. The model that the authors develop projects the unobserved preferences for attributes to a lower dimensional space of unobserved factors. The factors are interpretable as household “traits” that transcend categories, and they can be used to predict preferences for attributes in new categories. The authors apply the proposed model to household panel data for three closely related snack categories and for two less-related food categories. The authors find strong correlations in preferences for product attributes such as brand names and low fat or fat free. This study demonstrates that these high correlations in product attribute preferences across categories are useful in targeting activities in existing and new categories.","Vishal P.

In this study, the authors investigate consumers' evaluations of different mass customization configurations when they are asked to mass customize a product. For example, mass customization configurations may differ in the number of modules that can be mass customized. In the context of mass customization of personal computers, the authors find that mass customization configuration affects the product utility that consumers can achieve in mass customization as well as their perception of mass customization complexity. In turn, product utility and complexity affect the utility that consumers derive from using a certain mass customization configuration. More specifically, product utility has a positive effect and complexity has a negative effect on mass customization utility. The effect of complexity is direct as well as indirect because complexity also lowers product utility. The authors also find that consumers with high levels of product expertise consider mass customization configurations less complex than do consumers with low levels of product expertise and that for more-expert consumers, complexity has a less-negative impact on product utility. The study has important managerial implications for how companies can design their mass customization configuration to increase utility and decrease complexity.","Benedict G.C.

It shows that the equilibrium outcomes do not change with these definitions if manufacturers are modeled as Stackelberg pricing leaders to their retailer. However, if manufacturers are modeled as Bertrand-Nash competitors to their retailer or as Stackelberg pricing followers to their retailer, the equilibrium outcomes change depending on how the retailer's pricing decision variables are defined. Moreover, if in these two cases manufacturers and retailer are allowed to define their own pricing decision variables, then (1) manufacturers are indifferent about choosing among absolute prices, absolute margins, and percentage margins, but (2) the retailer chooses percentage margins.

Second, the authors show that though the desire for uniqueness leads to higher prices and firm profits, a desire for conformity leads to lower prices and profits. Third, the authors find that consumers purchase high-quality products not because of their desire for uniqueness but despite it. Finally, marketers of conspicuous goods may find it beneficial not to emphasize the functional differences among their products when the need for uniqueness is high.

A hedonic alternative tends to be rated more highly than a comparable utilitarian alternative when each is presented singly, but the utilitarian alternative tends to be chosen over the hedonic alternative when the two are presented jointly. Second, people have preferences for expending different combinations of time (effort) and money for acquiring hedonic versus utilitarian items.

Experimental economics literature, with its emphasis on incentive alignment and hypothetical bias, suggests that more realistic incentive-aligned studies result in stronger out-of-sample predictive performance of actual purchase behaviors and provide better estimates of consumer preference structures than do hypothetical studies. To test this hypothesis, the authors design an experiment with conventional (hypothetical) conditions and parallel incentive-aligned counterparts. Using Chinese dinner specials as the context, the authors conduct a field experiment in a Chinese restaurant during dinnertime. The results provide strong evidence in favor of incentive-aligned choice conjoint analysis, in that incentive-aligned choice conjoint outperforms hypothetical choice conjoint in out-of-sample predictions. To determine the robustness of the results, the authors conduct a second study that uses snacks as the context and considers only the choice treatments. This study confirms the results by providing strong evidence in favor of incentive-aligned choice analysis in out-of-sample predictions.

Accounting for both the retailer and the manufacturer decisions enables the authors to evaluate the degree of manufacturer competition, retailer–manufacturer interactions, and retailer product-category pricing. Given the model assumptions and the market being studied, the authors find that not accounting for demand endogeneity can create bias in the estimation, the retailer seems to price below the static profit-maximizing prices for two of the three brands, and the inferred marginal wholesale prices are below the equilibrium uniform wholesale prices for two brands.

Using consumer data on relational exchanges in two different service contexts—retail clothing and nonbusiness airline travel—and accounting for different sources of error—namely, measurement, common method, and response style—the authors empirically investigate the hypothesized mechanisms. The data support the motivator, or the enhancing role of trust, and the hygiene, or the maintaining role of satisfaction, on loyalty intentions in both contexts. Although the authors also obtain consistent results for the influence of value, its role is aligned with a hygiene mechanism, not a bivalent mechanism.

A Multipurpose Shopping Trip Model to Assess Retail Agglomeration Effects,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.42.1.109.56884,01-Feb-05,01-Feb-05,42,1,109,115,"Multipurpose shopping is a prominent and relevant feature of shopping behavior.

The authors propose a nested-logit model that captures retail agglomeration effects on consumer choice of shopping trip purpose (what to buy) and destination (where to buy). The authors estimate parameters representing trip purpose-adjustment and between-store attraction effects on shopping trip data collected from a sample of 1704 households in The Netherlands. Both effects are significant for each of the three categories for which the model is estimated. This is consistent with the idea of agglomeration effects. The findings suggest that agglomeration helps attract not only multipurpose but also single-purpose trips.

First, the authors model how respondents infer missing levels of product attributes in a partial conjoint profile by developing a learning-based imputation model that nests several extant models. The advantage of this approach over previous research is that it infers missing levels of an attribute not only from prior levels of the same attribute but also from prior levels of other attributes, especially ones that match the attribute levels of the current product profile. Second, the authors provide an empirical demonstration of their approach and test whether learning in conjoint studies occurs; to what extent; and in what manner it affects responses, partworths, and the relative importance of attributes. They show that the relative importance of attribute partworths can shift when subjects evaluate partial profiles, which suggests that consumers may construct rather than retrieve partworths and are sensitive to the order in which the profiles are presented. Finally, the results show that consumers' imputation processes can be influenced by manipulating their prior information about a product category. This research is of both theoretical and practical importance. Theoretically, this research sheds light on how customers integrate different sources of information in evaluating products with incomplete attribute information; practically, it highlights the potential pitfalls of imputing missing attribute levels using simple rules and develops a better behavioral model for describing and predicting customers' ratings for partial conjoint profiles.","Eric T.

The data show that when a small coupon face value is offered, the shelf price is likely to be reduced. They also find that coupon efficiency increases when there is a lower retail price. The results are of interest to managers planning a promotion calendar and deciding whether to coordinate price promotions with coupon events, and they contribute to economic theory.

However, consumers in many marketplace situations may consider the buy/no-buy decision before the selection decision (i.e., a buy/no-buy response mode). This article examines the differences in evaluation processes and choice deferral for the two response modes. The authors' theoretical account suggests that an initial focus on the buy/no-buy decision activates greater use of alternative-based evaluations, thus making purchase deferral more sensitive to the valence of shared features and category reference information than in the unconditional brand-choice mode.

They also extend the SPC framework to allow for a richer description of the complex linkages between vendor effort and account profitability, namely, nonlinear linkages and differential responsiveness occasioned by customer-specific factors such as competitive context. Controlling for such factors illuminates, to some degree, why similar levels of customer management effort and/or performance can yield quite different customer profitability outcomes. The authors present an application that demonstrates how adaptation and extension of the SPC to business markets can provide vendors with (1) insights into the process that culminates in individual customer profitability and (2) useful guidelines for adapting their customer management efforts at the individual account level with an aim to improve account profitability.

Previous cross-category studies have typically assumed that the cross-category effects are the same across brands or items because the potential number of price effects to be estimated is large. The authors address this problem by decomposing the variability of cross-category price effects into two components: variability across items and across stores. They capture the variability across items by representing the item-level parameters as draws from distributions with category-level means. They account for variability across stores through a random-effects factor structure that represents the variation of within- and between-category price effects separately. The model is calibrated on weekly store sales data of items in three orange juice subcategories (refrigerated, frozen, and shelf-stable). The authors study competition between national brands and private labels across the subcategories, for which their model lends itself well. The results show asymmetrical price competition not only within but also across subcategories: the cross-subcategory impact of national brands on store brands appears to be substantially greater than that of store brands on national brands. In addition, the model supports the implementation of price zones at a more granular level than the current practice.","Michel Wedel, Jie Zhang",,0
Incidental Prices and Their Effect on Willingness to Pay,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.41.4.457.47014,01-Nov-04,01-Nov-04,41,4,457,466,"Previous research has explored how both internal and external references prices affect consumer perceptions and consequently the price that consumers are willing to pay for a product or service. Historically researchers have examined the effects of exposure to prices for the same product, the same brand, or products in the same category. This research explores the effect of incidental prices on the consumer's willingness to pay. The authors define incidental prices as prices advertised, offered, or paid for unrelated products or goods that neither sellers nor buyers regard as relevant to the price of an item that they are engaged in selling or buying. More specifically, the authors examine how prices for products that buyers encounter unintentionally can serve as anchors, thus affecting willingness to pay for the product that they intend to buy.

Response Modeling with Nonrandom Marketing-Mix Variables,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.41.4.467.47005,01-Nov-04,01-Nov-04,41,4,467,478,"Sales response models are widely used as the basis for optimizing the marketing mix. Response models condition on the observed marketing-mix variables and focus on the specification of the distribution of observed sales given marketing-mix activities. The models usually fail to recognize that the levels of the marketing-mix variables are often chosen with at least partial knowledge of the response parameters in the conditional model. This means that contrary to standard assumptions, the marginal distribution of the marketing-mix variables is not independent of response parameters. The authors expand on the standard conditional model to include a model for the determination of the marketing-mix variables. They apply this modeling approach to the problem of gauging the effectiveness of sales calls (details) to induce greater prescribing of drugs by individual physicians. They do not assume a priori that details are set optimally, but instead they infer the extent to which sales force managers have knowledge of responsiveness, and they use this knowledge to set the level of sales force contact. The authors find that their modeling approach improves the precision of the physician-specific response parameters significantly. They also find that physicians are not detailed optimally; high-volume physicians are detailed to a greater extent than low-volume physicians without regard to responsiveness to detailing. It appears that unresponsive but high-volume physicians are detailed the most. Finally, the authors illustrate how their approach provides a general framework.","Puneet Manchanda, Peter E.

Vertical Marketing Systems for Complex Products: A Triadic Perspective,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.41.4.479.47015,01-Nov-04,01-Nov-04,41,4,479,487,"Products that require extensive and complex information flows among suppliers, intermediary vendors, and customers often pose particular challenges to the vertical marketing system. Using social network theory, the authors investigate buyers' preferences for specific patterns of relationships among buyers, intermediary vendors, and suppliers of complex products. Using a conjoint experiment with actual and prospective buyers of integrated computer networks and services, the authors find that beyond their dyadic interaction with a vendor, buyers take into account the buyer-vendor-supplier triad. Specifically, buyers value sequences of selective strong ties as well as sequences of more numerous weak ties. This is consistent with theoretical propositions that strong ties facilitate the mobilization of support and the transfer of complex knowledge, whereas nonoverlapping weak ties facilitate the gathering of intelligence and the monitoring of new developments. The authors find only mixed evidence that buyers value direct access to suppliers when strong ties exist between the vendor and suppliers, as predicted by the third-party sanctioning argument in social network theory. In addition, they find that interaction intensity and valence do not always have the same effects, thus providing criterion validation to the bidimensional nature of tie strength that has been documented in previous research.","Stefan Wuyts, Stefan Stremersch, Christophe Van Den Bulte,...",,3

Alternative Models for Capturing the Compromise Effect,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.41.3.237.35990,01-Aug-04,01-Aug-04,41,3,237,257,"The compromise effect denotes the finding that brands gain share when they become the intermediate rather than extreme option in a choice set. Despite the robustness and importance of this phenomenon, choice modelers have neglected to incorporate the compromise effect in formal choice models and to test whether such models outperform the standard value maximization model. In this article, the authors suggest four context-dependent choice models that can conceptually capture the compromise effect. Although the models are motivated by theory from economics and behavioral decision research, they differ with respect to the particular mechanism that underlies the compromise effect (e.g., contextual concavity versus loss aversion). Using two empirical applications, the authors (1) contrast the alternative models and show that incorporating the compromise effect by modeling the local choice context leads to superior predictions and fit compared with the traditional value maximization model and a stronger (naive) model that adjusts for possible biases in utility measurement, (2) generalize the compromise effect by demonstrating that it systematically affects choice in larger sets of products and attributes than has been previously shown, (3) show the theoretical and empirical equivalence of loss aversion and local (contextual) concavity and (4) demonstrate the superiority of models that use a single reference point over “tournament models” in which each option serves as a reference point.

The key to measuring the influence of loyalty programs is that they operate as dynamic incentive schemes by providing benefits based on cumulative purchasing over time. As such, loyalty programs encourage consumers to shift from myopic or single-period decision making to dynamic or multiple-period decision making. In this study the author models customers' response to a loyalty program under the assumption that purchases represent the sequential choices of customers who are solving a dynamic optimization problem. The author estimates the theoretical model using a discrete-choice dynamic programming formulation. The author evaluates a specific loyalty program with data from an online merchant that specializes in grocery and drugstore items. Through simulation and policy experiments, it is possible to evaluate and compare the long-term effects of the loyalty program and other marketing instruments (e.g., e-mail coupons, fulfillment rates, shipping fees) on customer retention.

The model predicts online buying by linking the purchase decision to what visitors do and to what they are exposed to while at the site. To overcome the challenges of predicting Internet buying, the authors decompose the purchase process into the completion of sequential nominal user tasks and account for heterogeneity across visitors at the county level. Using a sequence of binary probits, the authors model the visitor's decision of whether to complete each task for the first time, given that the visitor has completed the previous tasks at least once. The results indicate that visitors' browsing experiences and navigational behavior predict task completion for all decision levels. The results also indicate that the number of repeat visits per se is not diagnostic of buying propensity and that a site's offering of sophisticated decision aids does not guarantee increased conversion rates. The authors also compare the predictive performance of the task-completion approach with single-stage benchmark models in a holdout sample. The proposed approach provides superior prediction and better identifies likely buyers, especially early in the task sequence.

They develop a conceptual model of compliant behavior as a function of four main constructs: (1) salience/mindfulness, (2) the consumer's costs and benefits of compliant behavior, (3) advertising and distribution cues to action, and (4) the perceived threats associated with noncompliant behavior. They test the model using a regression mixture model of compliant behavior calibrated on unique panel data from four categories of pharmaceutical drugs that are used to treat chronic (i.e., lifelong) ailments. The findings include insights into the dynamics of product compliance: The data support the proposed four-stage evolution of compliant behavior between consecutive service provider (e.g., doctor) interventions. For marketers, the authors find substantial heterogeneity across consumers for the effects of cues from advertising and distribution. For example, in some segments, advertising has a positive impact on compliance (directly and/or by heightening responsiveness to product-efficacy evaluations), whereas in other segments, its effect is negative. Thus, the authors shed new light on the effects of advertising, which has both strong advocates and opponents in the pharmaceutical industry.","Douglas Bowman, Carrie M. Heilman, P.B.

The Determinants of Pre- and Postpromotion Dips in Sales of Frequently Purchased Goods,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.41.3.339.35992,01-Aug-04,01-Aug-04,41,3,339,350,"The authors empirically study the relationships between pre- and post-promotion dips in weekly store data and Universal Product Code (UPC), category, and store trading-area customer characteristics. Drawing on recent advances in econometric modeling, they estimate 39,441 pre- and postpromotion dip elasticities in 83 stores in ten product categories. They relate these elasticities to 24 characteristics, such as UPC price and market share, category budget share and storability, and store trading-area demographics. The authors find that UPC, category, and store trading-area customer characteristics all explain significant variation in the elasticities. For example, both pre- and postpromotion dips are stronger for high-priced, frequently promoted, mature, high-market-share UPCs. They find that postpromotion dips are not significantly different for private labels but are more prominent for UPCs with less predictable promotion patterns. They also find that stores with trading areas that consist of older customers who live in larger households and own cars are particularly prone to postpromotion dips. The findings potentially deepen the understanding of stockpiling and deceleration and blend two trends in promotion response research: an increased focus on pre- and postpromotion effects and a greater emphasis on examination of cross-sectional differences in promotion response.","Sandrine Macé, Scott A.

The Recoverability of Segmentation Structure from Store-Level Aggregate Data,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.41.3.351.35988,01-Aug-04,01-Aug-04,41,3,351,364,"The authors focus on estimating a latent-class choice model with consumer response segments when only store-level aggregate data are available. Most of the proposed methodologies in the marketing literature require household panel data, which can be difficult to obtain. There is a growing stream of work in marketing and in empirical industrial organization that estimates segmentation structure with aggregate data. This article is a careful attempt to understand the extent to which disaggregate structure in the form of a latent-class model can be recovered from aggregate data. The authors show that under specific assumptions and when the household-level model is correctly specified, most of a latent-class segmentation structure is identifiable even if only store-level aggregate data are available. Therefore, the store data-based estimates for the latent-class model are consistent. In other words, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the estimates goes to zero with infinite sample size. To assess how well latent-class structure can be estimated from store data sets of sample sizes that are comparable to those in real life, the authors simulate more than 60,000 store data sets and compute the consequent model estimates and their estimation errors. The results show that the MAD of the latent-class estimates diminishes much more slowly with store data than with household data. Moreover, the rate is so slow that obtaining estimates with reasonably small MADs often requires unreasonably large sample sizes. The authors' simulations offer guidance on conditions that favor obtaining more accurate estimates from store-level data.","Anand V. Bodapati, Sachin Gupta",,3

For example, consumers are loyal to a multiproduct firm even when it does not offer a product that matches their preferences better than a product of competing firms.

In turn, this increased perceptual fluency leads to consumers having more favorable attitudes toward the brand. The authors extend the processing fluency model to examine the effect of conceptual fluency on attitudes. In three experiments, the authors show that when a target comes to mind more readily and becomes conceptually fluent, as when it is presented in a predictive context (e.g., a bottle of beer featured in an advertisement that shows a man entering a bar) or when it is primed by a related construct (e.g., an image of ketchup following an advertisement of mayonnaise), participants develop more favorable attitudes toward the target. It is believed that positive valence of fluent processing underlies these processing-fluency effects. When conceptual fluency is associated with negative valence (e.g., hair conditioner primed by a lice-killing shampoo), the authors observe less favorable attitudes.","Angela Y. Lee, Aparna A.

As innovations affect markets, there is a pressing need to develop market response models that can adapt to such changes. The authors' model copes with the challenges that dynamic environments entail: nonstationarity, changes in parameters over time, missing data, and cross-sectional heterogeneity. They use this approach to model sales response in the frozen pizza category, in which the introduction of rising-crust pizza brands represents a major innovation. The model is directly applicable to other domains in which market structure might be nonstationary, such as changes in promotion strategy, shifts in the retail environment, and movements in macroeconomic factors. The authors find that innovation (1) makes the existing brands appear more similar, as indicated by increasing cross-brand price elasticities; (2) decreases brand differentiation for the existing brands, as indicated by an increase in the magnitude of own-brand price elasticities; and (3) increases the variance of the sales response equations temporarily around the time of the introduction of the innovation, indicating increased uncertainty in sales response. The authors discuss the managerial implications by presenting maps of how clout and vulnerability evolve over time, assessing the effect of new brands on cannibalization, and considering the strategic implications of the introduction of a flanker innovation to facilitate an extant brand's ability to attack an incumbent leader.","Harald J.

Model of Brand Choice with a No-Purchase Option Calibrated to Scanner-Panel Data,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.41.2.184.28674,01-May-04,01-May-04,41,2,184,196,"In usual practice, researchers specify and estimate brand-choice models from purchase data, ignoring observations in which category incidence does not occur (i.e., no-purchase observations). This practice can be problematic if there are unobservable factors that affect the no-purchase and the brand-choice decisions. When such a correlation exists, it is important to model simultaneously the no-purchase and the brand-choice decisions. The authors propose a model suitable for scanner-panel data in which the no-purchase decision depends on the price, feature, and display of each brand in the category and on household stock of inventory. They link the no-purchase model to the brand-choice outcome through marketing-mix covariates and through unobservables that affect both outcomes. The authors assume that model parameters are heterogeneous across households and allow for a flexible correlation structure between the coefficients in the no-purchase model and those in the brand-choice model. The model formulation is more general than what is possible from either a nested logit model or a translog utility model and from models in which the no-purchase outcome is an additional outcome with the deterministic component of its utility set equal to zero. The authors estimate the proposed model using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation methods. They then apply the estimation methods to scanner-panel data on the cola product category and compare the results with those from the widely used nested logit model.","Siddhartha Chib, P.B.

In a series of experiments, they manipulate the hue, value, and chroma dimensions of the color to induce more or less relaxed feeling states. The findings suggest that for each dimension, colors that induce more relaxed feeling states lead to greater perceived quickness. The authors provide triangulating evidence with an alternative manipulation: the number of times subjects wait for a download. As does color, this also leads to variation in levels of relaxation and perceived quickness.

This is because not doing so biases response coefficient estimates that can potentially alter the conclusions drawn from such analyses. In this article, the authors present an extension to the latent class model (LCM) that accounts for additional heterogeneity by allowing households' preferences to be a continuous mixture of segment-level preferences. The authors show how their model generalizes the LCM by the mere addition of S + 1 parameters, where S refers to the number of segments. Because a limitation of the traditional LCM is that it does not adequately account for heterogeneity in responses across households, the authors' model mitigates this criticism leveled at the LCM. They then compare their model with the traditional LCM and the equivalent continuous mixture (random-effects) models in terms of model selection criteria and predictive ability. The results indicate that the authors' model outperforms both the LCM and the equivalent random-effects (logit) model on these criteria.","Sajeev Varki, Pradeep K. Chintagunta",,0

In some cases, firms engage in extensive efforts to reacquire lapsed customers or defectors, and a common tactic is lowering the price to reacquire a customer. This investigation goes beyond the reacquisition pricing strategy and also examines the optimal pricing strategy when the customer has decided to reinitiate the relationship. By simultaneously modeling reacquisition and duration of the second tenure with the firm, the authors determine that the optimal pricing strategy for their application involves a low reacquisition price and higher prices when customers have been reacquired.

Valenced Comparisons,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.41.1.46.25080,01-Feb-04,01-Feb-04,41,1,46,58,"In this article, the authors show empirically that comparative advertisements can vary in terms of their valence, that is, whether respondents perceive them as positive (less derogatory) or negative (more derogatory) in their references to competition. In addition, the authors report findings from three studies that demonstrate that advertisements perceived as carrying more negative/derogatory references to competition result in more counterarguments, fewer support arguments, lower believability more associated perceived bias, and lower brand attitude scores than do advertisements perceived as more positive/nonderogatory in their competitive references. Tests of mediation suggest that the effectiveness of valenced comparisons is mediated by advertiser attributions that are more negative for negative comparisons. The authors discuss implications for designing more effective comparative advertisements.","Shailendra Pratap Jain, Steven S. Posavac",,0
Using Combined-Currency Prices to Lower Consumers’ Perceived Cost,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.41.1.59.25085,01-Feb-04,01-Feb-04,41,1,59,72,"The increasing popularity of loyalty programs and related marketing promotions has resulted in the introduction of several new currencies (e.g., frequent flier miles, Diner's Club “Club Rewards”) that consumers accumulate, budget, save, and spend much as they do traditional paper money. As consumers are increasingly able to pay for goods and services such as airline travel, hotel stays, and groceries in various combinations of currencies, an understanding of how shoppers respond to “combined-currency pricing” is important for marketers. This research is the first to explore how consumers evaluate transactions that involve combined-currency prices, or prices issued in multiple currencies (e.g., $39 and 16,000 miles). The authors present a formal mathematical proof that outlines the conditions under which a price that comprises payments delivered in different currencies can be superior to a standard, single-currency price, either by lowering the psychological or perceived cost associated with a particular revenue objective (i.e., price) or by raising the amount of revenue collected given a particular perceived cost. Three studies, in which respondents evaluate and choose among prices issued in single and combined currencies, offer both experimental and empirical support.","Xavier Drèze, Joseph C. Nunes",,3
A Direct Approach to Predicting Discretized Response in Target Marketing,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.41.1.73.25081,01-Feb-04,01-Feb-04,41,1,73,85,"A problem that occurs frequently in direct marketing is the prediction of the value of a discretizing function of a response variable. For example, to target consumers for a coupon mailing, a retail chain may want to predict whether a prospective customer's grocery expenditures exceed a predetermined threshold. The current approach to this prediction problem is to model the response variable and then apply the discretizing function to the predicted value of the response variable. In contrast with this “indirect” approach, the authors propose a “direct” approach in which they model discretized values of the response variable. They show theoretically that the direct approach achieves better predictive performance than the commonly used indirect approach when the response model is misspecified and the sample size is large. These two conditions are commonly met in direct marketing situations. This result is counterintuitive because the direct approach entails “throwing away” information. However, although both the discretized response data and the continuous data provide biased predictions when a misspecified model is used, the lower information content of the discretized variable helps the bias be smaller. The authors demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in a simulation experiment, a retail targeting application, and a customer satisfaction application. The key managerial implication of the result is that the current practice of restricting attention to models based on the indirect approach may be suboptimal. Target marketers should expand the set of candidate models to include models based on the proposed direct approach.","Anand Bodapati, Sachin Gupta",,0

Store-brand market shares differ by country and are usually much higher in Europe than in the United States. The authors study the notion that the differential success of store brands in the United States and Europe is the higher brand equity that store brands command in Europe than in the United States. They use a framework based on consumer brand choice under uncertainty and brands as signals of product positions to conduct their analysis. More specifically, they examine whether uncertainty about quality (or the positioning of the brand in the product space); perceived quality of store brands versus national brands; consistency in store-brand offerings over time; and consumer attitudes toward risk, quality, and price underlie the differential success of store brands at least partially in the United States and Europe. The authors’ model is estimated on scanner-panel data on laundry detergent in the U.S., U.K., and Spanish markets and on toilet paper and margarine data in the U.S. and Spanish markets. The authors find that consumer learning and perceived risk (and associated brand equity), as well as consumer attitude toward risk, quality, and price, play an important role in consumers’ store-brand and national-brand choices and contribute to the differences in relative success of store brands across the countries studied.","Tülin Erdem, Ying Zhao, Ana Valenzuela",,3

Adopting an interactionist perspective, the authors propose that the effect of the attitude functions is contingent on contextual factors, which they theorize as the nature of the product (along public-private and luxury-necessity dimensions) and the nature of the decision (forced or unforced purchase decision). Hypothesis testing is facilitated by survey data on actual purchase decisions and hazard models that incorporate individual heterogeneity. The results support the suggested role of attitude functions in explaining and predicting interpurchase intervals and suggest means by which managers can position their products to shorten interpurchase intervals.","Rajdeep Grewal, Raj Mehta, Frank R.

Polyhedral “interior-point” algorithms design questions that quickly reduce the sets of partworths that are consistent with the respondent's choices. To identify domains in which individual adaptation is promising (and domains in which it is not), the authors evaluate the performance of polyhedral choice-based conjoint analysis methods with Monte Carlo experiments. They vary magnitude (response accuracy), respondent heterogeneity estimation method, and question-design method in a 4 × 23 experiment. The estimation methods are hierarchical Bayes and analytic center. The latter is a new individual-level estimation procedure that is a by-product of polyhedral question design. The benchmarks for individual adaptation are random designs, orthogonal designs, and aggregate customization. The simulations suggest that polyhedral question design does well in many domains, particularly those in which heterogeneity and partworth magnitudes are relatively large. The authors test feasibility, test an important design criterion (choice balance), and obtain empirical data on convergence by describing an application to the design of executive education programs in which 354 Web-based respondents answered stated-choice tasks with four service profiles each.","Olivier Toubia, John R.

However, the role of synergy in multimedia communications is not well understood. Thus, the authors investigate the theoretical and empirical effects of synergy by extending a commonly used dynamic advertising model to multimedia environments. They illustrate how advertisers can estimate and infer the effectiveness of and synergy among multimedia communications by applying Kalman filtering methodology. Using market data on Dockers brand advertising, the authors first calibrate the extended model to establish the presence of synergy between television and print advertisements in consumer markets. Second, they derive theoretical propositions to understand the impact of synergy on media budget, media mix, and advertising carryover. One of the propositions reveals that as synergy increases, advertisers should not only increase the media budget but also allocate more funds to the less effective activity. The authors also discuss the implications for advertising overspending. Finally, the authors generalize the model to include multiple media, differential carryover, and asymmetrical synergy, and they identify topics for further research.","Prasad A.

This article examines whether brand-switching elasticities derived from these models are overestimated as a result of rational consumer adjustment of purchase timing to coincide with promotion schedules and whether a dynamic structural model can address this bias. Using simulated data, the authors first show that if the structural model is correct, brand-switching elasticities are overestimated by stand-alone logit models. A nested logit model improves the estimates, but not completely. Second, the authors estimate the models on real data. The results indicate that the structural model fits better and produces sensible coefficient estimates. The authors then observe the same pattern in switching elasticities as they do in the simulation. Third, the authors predict sales assuming a 50% increase in promotion frequency. The reduced-form models predict much higher sales levels than does the dynamic structural model. The authors conclude that reduced-form model estimates of brand-switching elasticities can be overstated and that a dynamic structural model is best for addressing the problem. Reduced-form models that include incidence can partially, though not completely, address the issue. The authors discuss the implications for researchers and managers.","Baohong Sun, Scott A.

Using longitudinal survey data, the authors find that firms in alliances dominated by competitors experience a significant decrease in their level of customer orientation. In contrast, the authors do not observe this type of decrease for firms in alliances dominated by channel members. Moreover, the authors find that both behavioral and structural mechanisms influence the relationship between alliance type and customer orientation. Behaviorally, firms in competitor-dominated alliances with weak relational ties with their collaborators exhibit a greater decrease in customer orientation compared with firms with strong ties with their collaborators. Structurally, firms that collaborate with competitors in alliances with a third-party monitor, such as a government agency, experience a smaller decrease in customer orientation than firms in alliances without such a monitor.","Aric Rindfleisch, Christine Moorman",,0

The Idiosyncratic Fit Heuristic: Effort Advantage as a Determinant of Consumer Response to Loyalty Programs,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.40.4.454.19383,01-Nov-03,01-Nov-03,40,4,454,467,"Over the past few years, customer relationship management and loyalty programs (LPs) have been widely adopted by companies and have received a great deal of attention from marketers, consultants, and, to a lesser degree, academics. In this research, the authors examine the effect of the level of effort required to obtain an LP reward on consumers' perception of the LP's attractiveness. The authors propose that in certain conditions, increasing program requirements can enhance consumers' likelihood of joining the program, thus leading consumers to prefer a dominated option. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that consumers often evaluate LPs on the basis of their individual effort to obtain the reward relative to the relevant reference effort (e.g., the effort of typical other consumers). When consumers believe they have an effort advantage over typical others (i.e., an idiosyncratic fit with the LP), higher program requirements magnify this perception of advantage and can therefore increase the overall perceived value of the program. The authors support this proposition in a series of studies in which the perceived idiosyncratic fit was manipulated either by reducing the individual effort or by raising the reference effort. The authors' findings also indicate that (1) idiosyncratic fit considerations are elicited spontaneously, (2) idiosyncratic fit mediates the effect of effort on consumer response to LPs, and (3) an alternative account for the results based on signaling is not supported. The authors conclude that the findings are part of a broader phenomenon, which they term the “idiosyncratic fit heuristic,” whereby a key factor that affects consumers' response to marketing programs and promotional offers is the perceived relative advantage or fit with consumers' idiosyncratic conditions and preferences.","Ran Kivetz, Itamar Simonson",,0

On the other hand, auditory and visual elements have the intended positive effect of facilitating ad copy recall when they are reinstated as part of an integrated marketing campaign or as a recall cue in an advertising tracking study.

A key result is that the majority of the sales promotion elasticity, approximately 74% on average, is attributed to secondary demand effects (brand switching) and the remainder is attributed to primary demand effects (timing acceleration and quantity increases). The authors demonstrate that this result does not imply that if a brand gains 100 units in sales during a promotion, the other brands in the category lose 74 units. The authors offer a complementary decomposition measure based on unit sales. The measure shows the ratio of the current cross-brand unit sales loss to the current own-brand unit sales gain during promotion; the authors report empirical results for this measure. They also derive analytical expressions that transform the elasticity decomposition into a decomposition of unit sales effects. These expressions show the nature of the difference between the two decompositions. To gain insight into the magnitude of the difference, the authors apply these expressions to previously reported elasticity decomposition results and find that approximately 33% of the unit sales increase is attributable to losses incurred by other brands in the same category.","Harald J.

Two basic aspects of browsing behavior are examined: (1) the visitor's decisions to continue browsing (by submitting an additional page request) or to exit the site and (2) the length of time spent viewing each page. The authors propose a type II tobit model that captures both aspects of browsing behavior and handles the limitations of server log-file data. The authors fit the model to the individual-level browsing decisions of a random sample of 5000 visitors to the Web site of an Internet automotive company. Empirical results show that visitors' propensity to continue browsing changes dynamically as a function of the depth of a given site visit and the number of repeat visits to the site. The dynamics are consistent both with “within-site lock-in” or site “stickiness” and with learning that carries over repeat visits. In particular, repeat visits lead to reduced page-view propensities but not to reduced page-view durations. The results also reveal browsing patterns that may reflect visitors' time-saving strategies. Finally, the authors report that simple site metrics computed at the aggregate level diverge substantially from individual-level modeling results, which indicates the need for Web site analyses to control for cross-sectional heterogeneity.","Randolph E.

The conjoint model and balance model are special cases of the general model. The authors use mixture distributions in a hierarchical Bayesian framework to incorporate consumer heterogeneity in a more flexible manner than the extant approaches such as latent-class and random-coefficient models. The empirical tests of the model show that most attribute effects are significant and consistent with the model's predictions. The model is superior to those that do not consider the issues of comparability of attributes, latent-class structure, and heterogeneity among respondents.

E-Customization,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.40.2.131.19224,01-May-03,01-May-03,40,2,131,145,"Customized communications have the potential to reduce information overload and aid customer decisions, and the highly relevant products that result from customization can form the cornerstone of enduring customer relationships. In spite of such potential benefits, few models exist in the marketing literature to exploit the Internet's unique ability to design communications or marketing programs at the individual level. The authors develop a statistical and optimization approach for customization of information on the Internet. The authors use clickstream data from users at one of the top ten most trafficked Web sites to estimate the model and optimize the design and content of such communications for each user. The authors apply the model to the context of permission-based e-mail marketing, in which the objective is to customize the design and content of the e-mail to increase Web site traffic. The analysis suggests that the content-targeting approach can potentially increase the expected number of click-throughs by 62%.","Asim Ansari, Carl F. Mela",,7
The Effect of Forced Choice on Choice,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.40.2.146.19229,01-May-03,01-May-03,40,2,146,160,"Whereas most academic and industry studies of consumer preferences and decision making involve forced choice (i.e., participants are told to choose one of the presented product or service alternatives), buyers usually also have the option not to select any alternative. An implicit assumption in the experimental practice of forcing choice is that the no-choice option draws proportionately from the various available alternatives, such that the qualitative conclusions are unaffected. However, the authors propose that the no-choice option competes most directly with alternatives that buyers tend to select when they are uncertain about their preferences. Building on this general proposition, the authors show that the introduction of the no-choice option strengthens the attraction effect, weakens the compromise effect, and decreases the relative share of an option that is “average” on all dimensions. They also examine the mechanisms underlying the impact of having the option not to choose and the conditions under which the no-choice option is likely to affect relative option shares. The results are consistent with the notion that the no-choice option provides an alternative way of resolving difficult choices that is not available when subjects are forced to choose. The authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this research.","Ravi Dhar, Itamar Simonson",,3
The Reciprocal Effects of Brand Equity and Trivial Attributes,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.40.2.161.19222,01-May-03,01-May-03,40,2,161,175,"Brands increasingly introduce products with attributes that fail to provide consumers with meaningful benefits (i.e., trivial attributes). The authors present two experiments that examine the effect of brand equity on consumer valuation of such trivial attributes and the reciprocal effect that such a strategy may have on brand equity. The results show that both high and low equity brands benefit from offering an attractive trivial attribute in the absence of a disclosure of its true value. However, prechoice disclosure of an attribute's triviality heightens the role of the brand and context cues. Competing low equity brands benefit by sharing the trivial attribute with a higher equity brand, whereas competing high equity brands benefit from uniquely offering a trivial attribute. Postchoice revelation that an attribute is trivial hurts the subsequent ability of a low but not a high equity brand to differentiate in a new product category, particularly among subjects who had previously chosen the target brand. For insights on brand dilution, the authors also examine consumer attributions regarding marketer intent for offering a trivial attribute.","Susan M. Broniarczyk, Andrew D. Gershoff",,0

Through an analytical model, the objective is to identify the optimal strategy for a high quality seller that offers a base warranty and optional extended warranty for a product whose quality is not observable to buyers. The author finds that signaling can limit a seller's ability to screen, especially when buyers are willing to pay a significant premium for higher quality. To signal, the seller generally lengthens base warranties and shortens optional coverage, making the bundles for each type of buyer more and more similar.

Specific Investments in Marketing Relationships: Expropriation and Bonding Effects,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.40.2.210.19223,01-May-03,01-May-03,40,2,210,224,"Specific investments, which are tailored to a particular company or value-chain partner, are important components of firms' marketing strategies. At the same time, extant theory suggests that such investments pose considerable risk, because they put the receiver in a position to opportunistically exploit the investor. In this article, the authors examine this “expropriation” scenario but also consider whether specific investments, because of their specialized nature, may actually “bond” the receiver and reduce opportunism under certain conditions. These conditions involve a focal relationship's time horizon (i.e., its extendedness) and particular norms. The key theoretical argument is that the effect of specific investments on opportunism will shift in a nonmonotonic fashion over the range of these relationship conditions. The authors test their research hypotheses empirically through parallel analyses on each side of 198 matched buyer–supplier dyads. The empirical tests provide general support for the predictions but also reveal differences between buyers and suppliers regarding the focal effects.

A Comparison of Segment Retention Criteria for Finite Mixture Logit Models,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.40.2.235.19225,01-May-03,01-May-03,40,2,235,243,"Despite the widespread application of finite mixture models in marketing research, the decision of how many segments to retain in the models is an important unresolved issue. Almost all applications of the models in marketing rely on segment retention criteria such as Akaike's information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, consistent Akaike's information criterion, and information complexity to determine the number of latent segments to retain. Because these applications employ real-world data in which the true number of segments is unknown, it is not clear whether these criteria are effective. Retaining the true number of segments is crucial because many product design and marketing decisions depend on it. The purpose of this extensive simulation study is to determine how well commonly used segment retention criteria perform in the context of simulated multinomial choice data, as obtained from supermarket scanner panels, in which the true number of segments is known. The authors find that an Akaike's information criterion with a penalty factor of three rather than the traditional value of two has the highest segment retention success rate across nearly all experimental conditions. Currently, this criterion is rarely, if ever, applied in the marketing literature. Experimental factors of particular interest in marketing contexts, such as the number of choices per household, the number of choice alternatives, the error variance of the choices, and the minimum segment size, have not been considered in the statistics literature. The authors show that they, among other factors, affect the performance of segment retention criteria.","Rick L. Andrews, Imran S. Currim",,0

Does it Make Sense to Use Scents to Enhance Brand Memory?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.40.1.10.19128,01-Feb-03,01-Feb-03,40,1,10,25,"Can pleasant ambient scents enhance consumer memory for branded products? If so, why? The authors examine the effects of ambient scent on recall and recognition of brands in two studies. In the first (i.e., encoding) phase of each study, subjects are asked to evaluate familiar and unfamiliar brands while viewing digital photographs of products on a computer screen; stimulus viewing times are measured covertly on the computer. Ambient scent is manipulated in the experiment room through a diffuser. In the second (i.e., retrieval) phase, conducted 24-hours later, brand recall and recognition accuracy are assessed. In both studies, ambient scent improves both recall and recognition of familiar and unfamiliar brands. This pattern emerges whether or not the scent is congruent with the product category (Study 1), and the enhancement in brand memory is due to the presence of ambient scent during encoding rather than retrieval (Study 2). Although ambient scent apparently did not alter subjects' self-assessed mood or arousal levels, it increased their attention in terms of longer stimulus viewing times. Mediation analyses suggest that the attention mechanism most likely explains why ambient scent improves brand memory.","Maureen Morrin, S. Ratneshwar",,16
Incommensurate Resources: Not Just More of the Same,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.40.1.26.19131,01-Feb-03,01-Feb-03,40,1,26,38,"The pricing literature is replete with research that focuses on how consumers respond to sales promotions when both the reference level and the change are expressed in dollar terms (i.e., discounts). The psychophysics of pricing suggests that changes in monetary magnitude are not based on their absolute level, but rather on their deviation from some reference level, or how the change is “framed.” Often, however, a promotion is presented in nonmonetary terms (e.g., a premium). When two resources are delivered simultaneously, but in different currencies (e.g., receive a free razor with the purchase of a can of shaving cream), the marginal value of the nonmonetary, incremental benefit may be difficult to evaluate in relation to the focal product or its price. Therefore, the value of the premium may be less likely than a comparable discount to be viewed in a relative sense and thus less likely to suffer from diminishing marginal returns. This research explores how people often fail to exhibit the same diminishing sensitivity to an incremental benefit, or cost, when it is accrued in a currency other than the referent currency. The authors define two different carriers of wealth or welfare (i.e., resources) that are difficult to convert into any meaningful common unit of measurement as “incommensurate.” This research introduces a novel mechanism for influencing whether people attend to absolute rather than relative differences. This work also offers guidance to managers who might benefit from the strategic use of nonmonetary promotions.","Joseph C. Nunes, C. Whan Park",,0

To determine the appropriate number of entries in a specific firm's product line, the author develops a model that balances the benefits of increased revenue from a broad product line against production and engineering costs. Two innovations were central in the development of the model: (1) redefining how products are scored on various product attributes so that attribute scores vary normally across the population of products and (2) redefining how the number of entries in a product portfolio is calculated in order to discount the significance of entries that are highly similar to existing products. The author also introduces the notion of a centroid time to more easily adjust sales and total development costs for product life cycle and investment life cycle effects. These redefinitions enable a firm's profit to be modeled as a simple function of its effective number of product entries, the effective number of competitors entries, the total sales in the segment, variable profits adjusted for capacity constraints, and product development costs. This leads to a simple expression for the profit-maximizing number of effective entries, both when competitor portfolios are fixed and when competitors dynamically adjust their portfolios. The author illustrates how to estimate and apply the model on a realistic example.",Robert Bordley,,0

In this article, the authors develop a framework to examine bargaining between channel members and demonstrate that the bargaining process actually affects the degree of coordination and that two-part tariffs will not be part of the market contract even in a simple one manufacturer-one retailer channel. To establish the institutional and theoretical bases for these results, the authors relax the conventional assumption that the product being exchanged is completely specifiable in a contract. They show that the institution of bargaining has force, and it affects channel coordination when the complexity of nonspecifiability of the product exchange is present. The authors find that greater retailer power promotes channel coordination. Thus, there are conditions in which the presence of a powerful retailer might actually be beneficial to all channel members. The authors recover the standard double-marginalization take-it-or-leave-it offer outcome as a particular case of the bargaining process. They also examine the implications of relative bargaining powers for whether the product is delivered “early” (i.e., before demand is realized) or “late” (i.e., delivered to the retailer only if there is demand). The authors present the implications for returns policies as well as of renegotiation costs and retail competition.","Ganesh Iyer, J. Miguel Villas-Boas",,3

In a recent JMR study, Andrews, Ansari, and Currim (2002; hereafter AAC) compared metric conjoint analysis models with discrete and continuous representations of heterogeneity and found no differences between the two models with respect to parameter recovery and prediction of ratings for holdout profiles. Models with continuous representations of heterogeneity fit the data better than models with discrete representations of heterogeneity. The goal of the current study is to compare the relative performance of logit choice models with discrete versus continuous representations of heterogeneity in terms of the accuracy of household-level parameters, fit, and forecasting accuracy. To accomplish this goal, the authors conduct an extensive simulation experiment with logit models in a scanner data context, using an experimental design based on AAC and other recent simulation studies. One of the main findings is that models with continuous and discrete representations of heterogeneity recover household-level parameter estimates and predict holdout choices about equally well except when the number of purchases per household is small, in which case the models with continuous representations perform very poorly.

Do we care what others Get? A Behaviorist Approach to Targeted Promotions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.39.3.277.19108,01-Aug-02,01-Aug-02,39,3,277,291,"Increased access to individual customers and their purchase histories has led to a growth in targeted promotions, including the practice of offering different pricing policies to prospective, as opposed to current, customers. Prior research on targeted promotions has adopted a tenet of the standard economic theory of choice, whereby what a consumer chooses depends exclusively on the prices available to that consumer. In this article, the authors propose that consumer preference for firms is affected not just by prices the consumers themselves are offered but also by prices available to others. This departure from the conventional strong-rationality approach to targeted promotion results in a decidedly different optimal policy. Through a laboratory experiment, calibration of a stochastic model, and game-theoretic analysis, the authors demonstrate that ignoring behaviorist effects exaggerates the importance of targeting switchers as opposed to loyals. This occurs, though with intriguing differences, even when only part of the market is aware of firms’ differing promotional policies. The authors show that both the deal percentage and the proportion of aware consumers affect the optimal strategy of the firm. Furthermore, the authors find that offering lower prices to switchers may not be a sustainable practice in the long run, as information spreads and the proportion of aware consumers grows. The model cautions practitioners against overpromoting and/or promoting to the wrong segment and suggests avenues for improving the effectiveness of targeted promotional policies.","Fred M.

A significant driver of this primary demand effect is consumer stockpiling in response to price promotions. Indeed, experimental studies have shown that additional inventory on hand can lead to an endogenous increase in consumption. The authors develop a model of price competition between firms in response to the stockpiling and subsequent consumption dynamics of consumers. In this setting, the flexible consumption effect causes more intense price competition, deeper promotions, and an increase in the frequency of promotions.

The Effects of Temporal Consistency of Sales Promotions and Availability on Consumer Choice Behavior,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.39.3.304.19106,01-Aug-02,01-Aug-02,39,3,304,320,"The importance of consistency of the marketing mix is widely regarded as a key marketing principle. Consistency is commonly understood to apply among marketing mix elements, but it also involves a temporal dimension: Marketing messages and, more generally, marketing mix strategies should achieve some degree of consistency over time. In this article, the authors focus on a particular aspect of marketing mix consistency over time in the context of frequently purchased packaged consumer goods: They investigate the impact of temporal consistency on store promotions, as well as the availability of the product on the shelf, on consumer product evaluations (utilities) and choices. In this specific context, temporal (in)consistency captures the degree of variability of prices, displays, and features, as well as availability over time, for a stockkeeping unit. The authors find that sales promotion mix consistency over time affects both consumer utility mean and scale and thus consumers’ choices and brand shares. Lack of sales promotion mix consistency is generally deleterious to consumer brand evaluations through (1) decreases to average valuations and (2) decreases in scale, both of which can lead to decreases in market share.","Joffre Swait, Tülin Erdem",,0
When Are Stockpiled Products Consumed Faster? A Convenience–Salience Framework of Postpurchase Consumption Incidence and Quantity,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.39.3.321.19111,01-Aug-02,01-Aug-02,39,3,321,335,"When people stockpile products, how do they decide when and how much they will consume? To answer this question, the authors develop a framework that shows how the salience and convenience of products influence postpurchase consumption incidence and quantity. Multiple research methods—including scanner data analysis, a field study, and two laboratory studies—show that stockpiling increases product salience and triggers consumption incidence among high-convenience products. However, when the decision is made to consume a product, stockpiling increases the consumption quantity for both high- and low-convenience products. In addition to providing new insights on how consumers make postpurchase consumption decisions, these results have implications for the debate on the value of promotions that induce stockpiling.","Pierre Chandon, Brian Wansink",,12

The authors compile extensive data on the complete foreign market entries of 19 multinational firms. They use a hazard model on 722 entry observations to evaluate the impact of the dynamic near-market knowledge measures and other economic and cultural variables on foreign market entry timing. In contrast with much previous research, the authors find that cultural distance from the domestic market is not a significant factor. However, the authors find significant effects for the new measures of near-market cultural and economic knowledge and for several other economic variables as well. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for further research and management practice.","Debanjan Mitra, Peter N. Golder",,0
Can Repeating a Brand Claim Lead to Memory Confusion?

Using dual component models of recognition memory, the author examines whether repetition, in the face of repetitions by similar competitors, might paradoxically increase memory confusion. In Experiment 1, the repetition of similar claims of equally familiar competitor brands produced two opposing effects: It increased memory for accurate claim recognition but also elevated brand claim confusion among advertised competitors. The pattern of results was similar when memory was tested a week after the initial exposure. In Experiment 2, in which participants were required to engage in a task designed to promote the “binding” between a brand and its claim, the memory confusion effects of repetition were significantly reduced. Finally, Experiment 3 replicated and generalized these findings by using more realistic stimuli and procedures. Thus, across three studies, the evidence strongly suggests that the confusion-elevating effects of repetition are a result of weak binding between memory for brand and claims.",Sharmistha Law,,0
The Asymmetric Share Effect: An Empirical Generalization on Cross-Price Effects,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.39.3.379.19109,01-Aug-02,01-Aug-02,39,3,379,386,"Prior empirical literature states that asymmetry in cross-price effect favors the high-share brand. That is, when high-share brands discount, they have a greater impact on low-share brands than the reverse. This conclusion is based on consideration of cross-price elasticities. The authors point out that focusing on cross-price elasticities for assessing asymmetry is inappropriate for determining the incremental profitability from price promotions. Instead, asymmetries should be investigated in absolute cross-price effects, that is, change in market share of a competing brand for a unit price change of the focal brand. The authors theoretically and empirically demonstrate that asymmetry reverses when absolute cross-price effect is considered. That is, the absolute cross-price effect of a price reduction of a low-share brand on the market share or sales of a high-share brand is greater than the reverse.

In this article, the author attempts to study empirically the extent to which three factors affect retail prices: (1) the effects of payments from manufacturers to the retailer other than regular promotions, as well as the effects of additional costs borne by the retailer for these brands; (2) the retailer's objectives specific to its store brand, such as maximizing store brand share; and (3) the effects of retail competition and store traffic. By specifying a demand function at the brand-chain level for each brand in the product category, the author derives pricing rules for the retailer. The author decomposes the retail price of a brand into effects due to wholesale price, markup (obtained from the demand functions), additional promotional payments, retail competition, and the retailer's objectives for the store brand. The author carries out empirical analysis for a specific product category at a single retail grocery chain.

Earning the Right to Indulge: Effort as a Determinant of Customer Preferences toward Frequency Program Rewards,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.39.2.155.19084,01-May-02,01-May-02,39,2,155,170,"Although frequency programs (FPs) have become ubiquitous in the marketplace and a key marketing-mix tool for promoting customer relationship and loyalty, little is known about the factors that determine how such programs are evaluated by consumers. The authors investigate the impact of the level of effort participants must invest to obtain the reward on the types of rewards they prefer and, consequently, on the decision to join the FP. In particular, the authors propose that higher required effort shifts consumer preferences from necessity to luxury rewards, because higher efforts reduce the guilt that is often associated with choosing luxuries over necessities. A series of studies with approximately 3100 consumers demonstrated that (1) higher program requirements shift preferences in favor of luxury rewards, (2) this effect is also observed when consumers choose between luxury and necessity rewards (of the same value) that they themselves proposed, and (3) the effect of program requirements on reward preferences is stronger among consumers who tend to feel guilty about luxury consumption and among those for whom the effort is invested in the context of work rather than pleasure. In addition, contrary to an alternative explanation based on the notion that higher requirements signal higher value of luxury rewards, the authors show that (1) when the program requirements are held constant but the individual consumer's effort is higher, the shift in preference toward luxuries is still observed and (2) increasing the monetary cost of participating in the FP decreases consumer preferences for luxury rewards.

Developing Synergies between Promotions and Brands in Different Price-Quality Tiers,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.39.2.171.19089,01-May-02,01-May-02,39,2,171,185,"Brands are promoted in many different ways. In this research, the authors examine synergies between different types of promotions and characteristics of the brands that offer the promotions. Specifically, the authors examine interactions among feature advertising, display, price promotions, and the price-quality tier of the brand offering them. Using both scanner data and experiments, the authors find that high-tier brands benefit more than low-tier brands from price promotions, displays, or feature advertising when these promotional tools are used by themselves. This advantage disappears, however, when certain promotional tools are used in combination with one another. In particular, the authors find that price promotions have a more equal effect on low-tier and high-tier brands when these promotions are offered in settings where comparisons are difficult (end-of-aisle displays or feature advertising). Furthermore, the combined effects of displays and price promotions, or feature advertising and price promotions, are greater on the low-tier brands than on the high-tier brands. The results provide insights into the conditions under which specific marketing tools are most effective for which brands. The authors discuss theoretical implications of the results as they relate to promotions and consumer decision making and outline strategic implications for retailers and manufacturers.","Katherine N.

Absence Makes the Mind Grow Sharper: Effects of Element Omission on Subsequent Recall,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.39.2.186.19082,01-May-02,01-May-02,39,2,186,201,"The authors investigate the memorial consequences of deliberately omitting crucial elements from an advertisement. Research on the self-generation effect in cognitive psychology indicates that such element omission may actually lead to an improvement in recall. Support for this perspective is obtained in a series of experiments that explores the effects of feature omission in the context of both overt omission (in which the omission is highlighted by the advertiser) and implicit omission (in which the omission, though not highlighted in the advertisement, is noticed because of prior expectations for that ad type). Even under highly constrained processing conditions (e.g., exposure times as short as four seconds), an advertisement that omits a key element is shown to produce better recall than an equivalent advertisement that contains the element. The authors find that this recall improvement occurs along dimensions that are specifically related to the omitted element; therefore, leaving out an element related only to the product category (but not the brand) produces an improvement only in category recall, whereas brand recall is improved by the omission of an element related to the brand name. The authors discuss theoretical and managerial implications of these findings.","Jaideep Sengupta, Gerald J. Gorn",,0

Findings from a series of experiments indicate that the incentive that is offered in a loyalty program is important to whether the program succeeds or fails at building brand loyalty. The data reported suggest that incentives that have overlap with brand associations, which the authors term cue-compatible incentives, can prompt rehearsal that increases the accessibility of favorable brand associations. This, in turn, helps boost postprogram loyalty. At the same time, incentives that are tangible or concrete can undermine postprogram loyalty. This seems to occur because elaboration is attracted to the incentive at the expense of the brand. Incentive associations may thus gain in accessibility and interfere with access to brand associations.","Michelle L. Roehm, Ellen Bolman Pullins, Harper A. Roehm, Jr.",,1

Existing market research techniques for measuring WTP differ in whether they provide an incentive to consumers to reveal their true WTP and in whether they simulate actual point-of-purchase contexts. The authors present an empirical comparison of several procedures for eliciting WTP that are applicable directly at the point of purchase. In particular, the authors test the applicability of Becker, DeGroot, and Marschak's (1964) well-known incentive-compatible procedure for assessing the utility of lotteries to measuring consumers' WTP. In three studies, the authors explore the reliability, validity, and feasibility of the procedure and show that it yields lower WTP estimates than do non-incentive-compatible methods such as open-ended and double-bounded contingent valuation. They show experimentally that differences in WTP estimates arise from the incentive constraint rather than the cognitive effort required in responding. They also control for strategic response behavior.","Klaus Wertenbroch, Bernd Skiera",,19

The authors formulate several special cases of the model and estimate them using the Gibbs sampler. The authors reanalyze Srinivasan and Park's (1997) data and show that the current model predicts real choices better than competing models do. The posterior credible intervals of the predictions of models with the different heterogeneity specifications overlap, so there is no clear superior specification of heterogeneity. However, when different sources of data are used—that is, full profile evaluations, self-stated importances, or both—clear differences arise in the accuracy of predictions. Moreover, the authors find that including the self-stated importances in the likelihood leads to much better predictions than does considering them prior information.","Frenkel Ter Hofstede, Youngchan Kim, Michel Wedel",,0

To obtain these predictions, the authors propose a model for market similarity that incorporates the structure of the U.S. retailing industry and the geographic location of markets. The model makes use of the idea that if two markets have the same retailers or are located close to each other, then branded goods in these markets should have similar sales performance (other factors being held constant). In holdout samples, the proposed spatial prediction method improves greatly on naive predictors such as global-market averages, nearest neighbor predictors, or local averages. In addition, the authors show that the spatial model gives more plausible estimates of price elasticities. It does so for two reasons. First, the spatial model helps solve an omitted variables problem by allowing for unobserved factors with a cross-market structure. An example of such unobserved factors is the shelf-space allocations made at the retail-chain level. Second, the model deals with uninformative estimates of price elasticities by drawing them toward their local averages.

The proattitudinal information accessible from memory is then aligned with information contained in the challenge in order to assess the diagnosticity of the challenge, that is, how much it “damages” the retrieved brand information. If the challenge is not perceived to be diagnostic, the retrieved brand information is used to defend the previous attitudinal position. If the challenge is perceived to be diagnostic, judgments are revised in direct proportion to the amount of damage identified in the alignment phase. Four experiments test the model's predictions about the influence of abstract versus attribute-specific brand positioning on judgment revision. Consistent with the model's predictions, results show that compared with attribute-specific positioning, abstract positioning will result in less judgment revision when the challenge is specific (e.g., a direct attack about particular attributes of the brand) and the initial brand evaluation is based on limited learning of the positioning information. When the challenge is general (e.g., a blanket, unspecific negative statement about the brand), abstract positioning will result in greater judgment revision than attribute-specific positioning will. The differential effectiveness of abstract versus attribute-specific positioning is mediated by (1) the accessibility in memory of the positioning information at the time of the challenge and (2) the perceived diagnosticity of the challenge after alignment with the retrieved brand information.","Michel Tuan Pham, A.V.

In many cases, it is reasonable to expect that the choice of a particular alternative may be influenced by non–product-related attributes. For example, latent attitudes and perceptions may play as much of a role in shaping choice as the attributes that have been manipulated and used to define the alternative offerings. In this article, the authors present several full information models that can accommodate latent variables such as attitudes and satisfaction within the context of binary and multinomial choice models. The models proposed are particularly useful when the focus is on understanding how softer attributes can influence choice decisions. The authors accomplish this by integrating structural equation models within the basic framework of binary and multinomial choice models. Two empirical applications are provided. In addition to illustrating the proposed models, these applications provide insights into the circumstances under which the simultaneous factor–choice modeling approach makes a difference.","Kalidas Ashok, William R.

Findings from these studies indicate that the originality of the resulting product design is influenced by the extent of analogical transfer, the type of analogies used, and the presence of external primes.

We propose a multiple ideal point model to capture these multiple preference effects. The basic premise of the model is that consumers may possess a set of ideal points, each of which represents a distinct preference. At any given purchase occasion, one of these points is “activated” with some probability, and choices are made with respect to its characteristics.

The authors then test these hypotheses in the context of a toll-free referral service, using a highly disaggregate econometric model of advertising response. The results indicate that argument-based appeals, expert sources, and negatively framed messages are particularly effective in new markets. Emotion-based appeals and positively framed messages are more effective in older markets than in new markets.","Rajesh K. Chandy, Gerard J. Tellis, Deborah J. Macinnis,...",,0
Understanding What's in a Brand Rating: A Model for Assessing Brand and Attribute Effects and Their Relationship to Brand Equity,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.38.4.415.18910,01-Nov-01,01-Nov-01,38,4,415,429,"Although brand ratings capture the favorability of brand associations, they often do not enable marketing managers to disentangle brand-specific associations from other effects. In this article, the authors present a decompositional model for analyzing brand ratings that addresses this nagging problem and provide insights for understanding the sources of brand equity. Starting with consumers' perceived level of a brand on an attribute, the authors decompose the rating into two components: brand-specific associations and general brand impressions. Brand-specific associations refer to features, attributes, or benefits that consumers link to a brand and that differentiate it from the competition. General brand impressions refer to general impressions about the brand that are based on a more holistic view of the brand. In this article, the authors focus on two principal issues: (1) How can the sources of bias that may be present in brand ratings be disentangled? and (2) Do these putatively biasing effects, if present, have any managerial implications for brand equity? The authors demonstrate the properties and advantages of the model in the context of three empirical applications.","William R. Dillon, Thomas J. Madden, Amna Kirmani,...",,0

They also study the interaction between sociodemographics and gain and loss sensitivity. Furthermore, the authors analyze cross-category correlations in gain and loss sensitivity to shed light on their individual- and category-specific characters. In three categories, the results show significant heterogeneity in loss sensitivity among consumers and indicate that loss sensitivity is greater and more heterogeneous than gain sensitivity. Across categories, the results show that loss-sensitive shoppers are less influenced by past brand use and that both loss- and gain-sensitive shoppers more sensitive to price, display, and feature than the average consumer. Loss-sensitive households tend to be larger, and their heads are less likely to be fully employed, whereas gain-sensitive households have no clear demographic profile. The authors also discuss the limitations of latent-class models in profiling consumer segments and show how these problems are overcome using models with continuous, correlated multivariate distributions.","Tülin Erdem, Glenn Mayhew, Baohong Sun",,0

In an empirical study, the authors examine the relationships among measures of product similarity in three different contexts: (1) goal-congruent products, (2) moderately goal-incongruent products, and (3) extremely goal-incongruent products. The results of exploratory factor analyses revealed that perceived similarity is a multidimensional construct and that the number and structure of these dimensions of similarity are different when products differ in their degrees of goal congruency. Structural equation analyses of the measures based on a second sample confirmed the structure obtained in the earlier exploratory analyses and demonstrated that brand attitudes and purchase intention exhibit different relationships to the underlying dimensions of similarity in the goal-congruent and goal-incongruent conditions, consistent with expectations based on the theory of goal-derived categorization.

Do We Really Know how Consumers Evaluate Brand Extensions?

The study has implications for the understanding of how brand extensions are evaluated and how empirical generalizations are made. For brand extensions, Aaker and Keller's model hypothesizes that evaluations of brand extensions are based on the quality of the original brand, the fit between the parent and extension categories, and the interaction of the two. The authors find support for this full model despite published results, including Aaker and Keller's own, that support only some of the hypotheses. The authors find evidence that the level of contribution of each of these components varies by brand and culture. With respect to empirical generalizations, the key implication is that it is premature to make firm conclusions about theory on the basis of only one study.","Paul A. Bottomley, Stephen J.S.

The authors develop a model of first-time sales and subscriptions for successive generations of a technological innovation, which explicitly captures the effects of marketing-mix variables through a proportional hazards framework. The empirical analysis estimates the impact of price for two generations of cellular telephones in a European country. The results suggest that there are important substantive insights to be gained from the parameter estimates for this marketing-mix variable when intergenerational interdependencies are considered. For example, although the time path of the estimated price elasticities in a multiple-generation setting closely follows those reported previously for single generations, the authors find evidence of an important interaction in price response across generations. Therefore, empirical estimates in single-generation models may be missing an important part of the pricing equation.","Peter J. Danaher, Bruce G.S. Hardie, William P. Putsis, Jr.",,0

The authors propose customer characteristics and context-specific factors that may relate to differences in the key characteristics of the underlying source model of share of category requirements and word of mouth. The authors then assess the overall importance of the explanatory variables in the source model and simultaneously test for systematic differences related to CIC-specific factors using survey data from more than 1700 CICs that involve more than 60 brands. A key assumption in much prior research that has examined customer–firm interactions is that CIC-specific factors, if they are included at all, create an automatic regularity that must be controlled for. The authors propose and find an additional effect. The responsiveness to factors under a firm's control varies across CICs, and therefore firms that adapt their processing have an advantage. Rather than provide a uniform response to all CICs, the authors' results offer managers several guidelines on how to customize their responses to the various CIC types and how to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their firms' CIC management efforts.","Douglas Bowman, Das Narayandas",,0
Optimizing Television Program Schedules Using Choice Modeling,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.38.3.298.18867,01-Aug-01,01-Aug-01,38,3,298,312,"The authors examine the rescheduling of television programs to maximize the total ratings for one network across a week. The key idea is to design a choice experiment in which television programs are rescheduled and presented to respondents. Respondents read these program schedules (much like the regular TV Guide listings) and give their preferences, including not watching any of the listed programs. Because there are potentially billions of possible schedules, the authors give a procedure for designing a fractional factorial experiment that can accommodate both programs of varying length and constraints on eligible program times. The authors also develop a latent class multinomial logit model for modeling program preferences and present a validation of our experimental procedure and the model. They also present an empirical test of the procedure in which they use the model to predict ratings for all the possible program schedules, not just those constituting the choice sets. In this example, the optimum schedule increases the predicted total weekly ratings during prime time by 18% for a network. The projected increase in total weekly ratings is achieved without the network needing to purchase any new programs; all it needs to do is reschedule eight programs in its existing prime-time lineup.","Peter J.

In this study, the authors find that the effects of fit disappear when attribute information is added to extension stimuli and are applicable only for later product adopters. The authors also find that perceived fit increases with greater exposure to an extension. Beyond implications for brand extension research, this study underscores the need to recognize that certain research design factors related to external validity, which are often assumed irrelevant, can alter what is held to be true.","Richard R.

What We See Makes Us who We are: Priming Ethnic Self-Awareness and Advertising Response,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.38.3.336.18871,01-Aug-01,01-Aug-01,38,3,336,348,"The authors propose that “ethnic self-awareness”—a temporary state during which a person is more sensitive to information related to his or her own ethnicity—moderates consumer response to targeted advertising. Ethnic self-awareness occurs when a person engages in a process of self-categorization and uses ethnic criteria as the basis for this categorization. The authors hypothesize that “ethnic primes”—visual or verbal cues that draw attention to ethnicity—direct self-categorization and increase ethnic self-awareness. To test these hypotheses, the authors conduct two experiments. Using 109 Asian and Caucasian participants, Experiment 1 assessed the impact of exposure to an Asian ethnic prime on ethnic self-awareness and on response to targeted television advertising. Exposure to an ethnic prime increased the rate at which participants spontaneously mentioned their ethnicity in self-descriptions (a measure of ethnic self-awareness) and caused participants to respond more favorably to same-ethnicity spokespeople and advertising that targeted their ethnicity. Experiment 2 tested the theory in a print advertising context and extended the design by manipulating the type of ethnic prime participants saw (Asian or Caucasian) and the market that the focal advertisement targeted (Asian or Caucasian). Experiment 2 replicated the findings of Experiment 1 when the focal advertisement targeted Asians, but not when it targeted Caucasians.","Mark R. Forehand, Rohit Deshpandé",,0

The basic premise is that several generic consumer segments exist and remain fixed across all albums, and each album (or each cluster of similar albums) can be viewed as drawing different proportions from each of these underlying segments. The authors also allow explanatory variables to have a differential impact on both components of the model—that is, accelerating purchase rates within a consumer segment and changing the proportions drawn from each consumer segment by each product cluster—thereby expanding or contracting the potential market size.

Using data from large, representative samples of consumers from 11 countries of the European Union, the authors find systematic effects of response styles on scale scores as a function of two scale characteristics (the proportion of reverse-scored items and the extent of deviation of the scale mean from the midpoint of the response scale) and show that correlations between scales can be biased upward or downward depending on the correlation between the response style components. In combination with the apparent lack of concern with response styles evidenced in a secondary analysis of commonly used marketing scales, these findings suggest that marketing researchers should pay greater attention to the phenomenon of stylistic responding when constructing and using measurement instruments.","Hans Baumgartner, Jan-Benedict E.M.

Remote purchase environments differ from traditional bricks-and-mortar purchases in that the purchase decision is more likely to be framed as two separate decisions: consumers' decisions to order and, upon receipt, their decisions to keep or return the item. These two decisions are separated by a period of time, and crucial experiential information often is available only at the second decision point (i.e., after receipt). Consumers' initial lack of experiential information makes product choice more risky. Return policy leniency is one way to minimize the inherent consumer risk, but retailers may avoid instituting overtly lenient policies because they expect increased return rates. However, the endowment effect suggests some surprising benefits of return policy leniency to the retailer.

In Search of Negative Customer Feedback: The Effect of Expecting to Evaluate on Satisfaction Evaluations,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.38.2.170.18841,01-May-01,01-May-01,38,2,170,182,"Customers' evaluations of quality and satisfaction are critical inputs in the development of marketing strategies. Given the increasingly common practice of asking for such evaluations, buyers of products (e.g., cars) and services (e.g., hotels, educational programs/courses) often know in advance that they subsequently will be asked to provide their evaluations. In a series of field and laboratory studies, the authors demonstrate that expecting to evaluate leads to less favorable quality and satisfaction evaluations and reduces customers' willingness to purchase and recommend the evaluated services. The negative bias of expected evaluations is observed when actual quality is either low or high, and it persists even when buyers are told explicitly to consider both the positive and negative aspects. The authors examine three possible explanations for this systematic bias, which are referred to as negativity enhancement, role expectation, and vigilant processing. The findings are most consistent with the negativity enhancement account, indicating that unless buyers begin the evaluation task with low expectations, they tend to focus during consumption primarily on negative aspects of product/service quality.

The proposed approach directly analyzes customers' portfolio of choices from each of several experimental menus by estimating the utility for each menu item as a function of its characteristics, its price, and other specific attributes such as multifeature discounts. The authors accommodate customer heterogeneity in the utilities, allow for correlation of the utilities across items, and incorporate constraints in menu choices.

These phenomena can produce complex nonlinearities and interactions in the deal effect curve that are best captured with a flexible approach. Because a fully nonparametric regression model suffers from the curse of dimensionality, the authors propose a semiparametric regression model. Store-level sales over time are modeled as a non-parametric function of own- and cross-item price discounts and a parametric function of other predictors. The authors compare the predictive validity of the semiparametric model with that of two parametric benchmark models and obtain superior performance. The results for three product categories indicate threshold and saturation effects for both own-and cross-item temporary price cuts. The authors also find that the nature of the own-item curve depends on other items' price discounts. Comparisons with restricted model specifications show that both the flexible main effects and flexible interaction effects contribute to the superior results for the semiparametric approach. The interaction effects are so complex that it is unlikely for any parametric model to be satisfactory. In a separate analysis, the authors illustrate how the shape of the deal effect curve depends on own-item promotion signals. There is a crossover interaction effect: For the item analyzed, feature advertising produces a higher sales effect up to a 20% discount, whereas display achieves higher sales for discounts in excess of 20%.","Harald J.

Various multidimensional scaling (MDS) and spatial methods have been used in the analysis of these variable batteries separately but not much effort has been expended in attempting to relate the individually derived spatial structures. The authors propose a new latent structure MDS procedure that is devised to represent jointly the structure in multiple batteries (preferences, proximities, and brand attribute ratings) of variables collected across the same set of respondents. The authors present the technical structure of the proposed maximum likelihood–based model and conceptually compare it with other related spatial MDS models. The authors present an illustration of the procedure with respect to the analysis of published proximity, preference, and brand ratings data collected from consumers who evaluated ten brands of soft drinks.","Wayne S.

Subscale Distance and Item Clustering Effects in Self-Administered Surveys: A New Metric,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.38.2.254.18837,01-May-01,01-May-01,38,2,254,261,"The authors explore the effect of a form of question context on responses to a computer-mediated marketing research survey. As an increasing proportion of marketing research is conducted through computer interfaces, the pool of potential context effects is rapidly expanding. The authors conduct an experiment using a multi-item scale that consists of five dimensions and manipulate three such context effects: explicit item labeling, item presentation (alone/grouped), and subscale items presented contiguously or not. In a refined analysis of variance, the authors use a special one-dimensional case of the spatial and attribute-based distance metric proposed by Hoch, Bradlow, and Wansink (1999) to explain subscale variance, replacing the indicator variable for clustering used in a standard analysis of variance. This metric provides a scalar measure of how much variation exists in the order of presentation of items within a subscale (the subscale distance). This analysis indicates a significant decrease in subscale variance (increased reliability) with decreasing sub-scale distance but no-longer-significant effects due to labeling and grouping. The authors discuss implications of their findings for researchers conducting surveys in computer-mediated environments.","Eric T. Bradlow, Gavan J. Fitzsimons",,0

Truth or Consequences: An Analysis of Vaporware and New Product Announcements,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.38.1.3.18834,01-Feb-01,01-Feb-01,38,1,3,13,"The software industry practice of announcing new products well in advance of actual market availability has led to allegations that firms are intentionally engaging in vaporware. The possible predatory and anticompetitive implications of this behavior recently surfaced in the antitrust case United States v. Microsoft Corporation. Taking the perspective that a new product announcement is a strategic signal among firms, the authors consider the possibility that intentional vaporware is a way to dissuade competitors from developing similar new products. An examination of empirical data for the software industry suggests that some firms use vaporware in a strategic manner. The authors then formulate and analyze the preannouncement and introduction timing decisions in a game-theoretic model of two competing firms. They find that vaporware can be a way for a dominant firm to signal its product development costs and that intentional vaporware can deter entry. The authors also show that there is a curvilinear relationship between development costs and announcement accuracy; that is, firms with high or very low product development costs make accurate product announcements, whereas firms with intermediate product development costs intentionally engage in vaporware. Empirical support for these theoretical results is also found in the software industry data. Finally, the authors discuss the beneficial and harmful consequences of vaporware and the associated implications.","Barry L. Bayus, Sanjay Jain, Ambar G. Rao",,3

In two experiments, the authors demonstrate that the relationship between expertise and adoption is relatively complex. Specifically, their findings indicate that, compared with novices, experts report higher comprehension, more net benefits, and therefore higher preferences for continuous innovations. However, for discontinuous innovations, experts' entrenched knowledge is related to lower comprehension, fewer perceived net benefits, and lower preferences compared with that of novices. Only when this entrenched knowledge is accompanied by relevant information from a supplementary knowledge base are experts able to understand and appreciate discontinuous innovations.

Transaction Decoupling: How Price Bundling Affects the Decision to Consume,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.38.1.30.18828,01-Feb-01,01-Feb-01,38,1,30,44,"In today's marketplace, price bundling is widespread: Manufacturers and retailers routinely offer multiple products for a single, bundled price. Although the effects of price bundling on purchase behavior have been well researched, the effects of price bundling on postpurchase consumption behavior have received almost no attention. In this article, the authors build on the sunk cost literature (e.g., Thaler 1980, 1985) and predict that price bundling leads to a disassociation or “decoupling” of transaction costs and benefits, thereby reducing attention to sunk costs and decreasing a consumer's likelihood of consuming a paid-for service (e.g., a theater performance). Four studies show this to be the case. In two lab studies, the authors show that having a bundled four-day ski pass as opposed to four one-day ski tickets decreases a person's likelihood of skiing on the final day of a four-day ski vacation. They replicate this result in a field study, showing that multiperformance ticket holders are more likely to forgo a given theatrical performance than are single-performance ticket holders, all else held constant. In a final study, the authors show that the decreased attention to sunk costs brought about by price bundling can be either cognitively driven (i.e., it is difficult to allocate a single payment across multiple benefits) or motivationally driven (i.e., there is an underlying desire to avoid consumption). Their findings have practical implications for managers interested in predicting or influencing actual product consumption.","Dilip Soman, John T. Gourville",,21

How a particular channel member reacts to such an act has implications for the long-term viability and success of the relationship. On the basis of a large data set collected from both a focal supplier and its independent dealers, the authors classify dealers' responses to a supplier's destructive acts by extending the response typology of exit, voice, and loyalty, which is based on Hirschman's seminal writings on responses to decline in organizations and states. This study finds that dealers' reactions are influenced by several antecedent factors: perceived intensity of the supplier's destructive act, the attributions relative to the act, relationship quality before the act, and the level of interdependence between dealer and supplier. The results suggest that these more proximal dealer responses affect subsequent dealer performance and overall perceptions of relationship quality after an act. The authors draw several implications for both dealers and suppliers.","Jonathan D. Hibbard, Nirmalya Kumar, Louis W. Stern",,0

The results of Study 1 show that the entrant's perceptions of the aggressiveness of the incumbent depend on the focus and strength of the incumbent's signals. The results of Study 2 show that the strength of the entrant's responses to the incumbent's signals depends on the incumbent's use of bluffs and the cost of information about the factors driving the incumbent's signals.

On the basis of a study of 141 cross-functional product development teams, the authors find that innovativeness is positively related to the strength of superordinate identity in the team, encouragement to take risk, customers' influence, and active monitoring of the project by senior management. Beyond a moderate level, social cohesion among team members has a negative effect on innovativeness. The effect of superordinate identity on innovativeness is strengthened by encouragement to take risk and weakened by social cohesion. Functional diversity has no effect on innovativeness.

The author develops a conceptual framework that examines how the use of equity and equality sharing principles in conjunction with various resource and organizational conditions can be used to affect relational outcomes systematically. Survey results of 300 research and development managers, scientists, and engineers indicate that sharing principles can have a positive or negative effect on the relationship depending on the type of sharing principle used and the characteristics of the resources and organizations. In particular, sharing processes should be responsive to the goals of the collaboration.

Moderated relationships are central to marketing (e.g., Does the effect of promotion on sales depend on the market segment?). Multiple regression models not including a product term are widely used and well understood. The authors argue that researchers have derived from this simpler type of multiple regression several data analysis heuristics that, when inappropriately generalized to moderated multiple regression, can result in faulty interpretations of model coefficients and incorrect statistical analyses. Using theoretical arguments and constructed data sets, the authors describe these heuristics, discuss how they may easily be misapplied, and suggest some good practices for estimating, testing, and interpreting regression models that include moderated relationships.","Julie R.

The authors show that there are important substantive insights to be gained by analyzing the product line decision in this fashion. In the personal computer industry, for example, firms expand their product lines when industry barriers are low or market opportunities are perceived to exist. High market share firms aggressively expand their product lines, as do firms with relatively high prices or short product lines. In general, the results highlight the various internal and external factors that influence firms' management of their product lines.","William P. Putsis, Jr., Barry L. Bayus",,0

This article fills this void by presenting a conceptual model for relating satisfaction ratings and repurchase behavior. The model is based on the premise that ratings observed in a typical customer satisfaction survey are error-prone measures of the customer's true satisfaction, and they may vary systematically on the basis of consumer characteristics. The authors apply the model to a large-scale study of 100,040 automotive customers. Results show that consumers with different characteristics have different thresholds such that, at the same level of rated satisfaction, repurchase rates are systematically different among different customer groups. The authors also find that the nature and extent of response bias in satisfaction ratings varies by customer characteristics. In one group, the response bias is so high that rated satisfaction is completely uncorrelated to repurchase behavior (r = 0). Furthermore, the authors find that, though nonlinear, the functional form relating rated satisfaction to repurchase intent is different from the one relating it to repurchase behavior. Although the functional form exhibits decreasing returns in the case of repurchase intent, it exhibits monotonically increasing returns in the case of repurchase behavior.","Vikas Mittal, Wagner A.

Parameter Bias from Unobserved Effects in the Multinomial Logit Model of Consumer Choice,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.37.4.410.18791,01-Nov-00,01-Nov-00,37,4,410,426,"Over the past two decades, validation of choice models has focused on predictive validity rather than parameter bias. In real-world validation of choice models, true parameter values are unknown, so examination of parameter bias is not possible. In contrast, the main focus of this study is parameter bias in simulated scanner-panel choice data with known parameter values. Study of parameter bias enables the assessment of a fundamental issue not addressed in the choice modeling literature—the extent to which the logit choice model is capable of distinguishing unobserved effects that give rise to persistence in observed choices (e.g., heterogeneity and state dependence). Although econometric theory provides some information about the causes of bias, the extent of such bias in typical scanner data applications remains unclear. The authors present an extensive simulation study that provides information on the extent of bias resulting from the misspecification of four unobserved effects that receive frequent attention in the literature—choice set effects, heterogeneity in preferences and market response, state dependence, and serial correlation. The authors outline implications for model builders and managers. In general, the potential for parameter bias in choice model applications appears to be high.

Although it has long been recognized that most purchase decisions are made with incomplete information, researchers still know little about the effect of missing information on consumer choice. Building on prior work by Slovic and MacPhillamy (1974), the authors demonstrate that a tendency to give more weight to attributes on which all considered options have values (common attributes), compared with attributes for which not all options have values (unique attributes), can often lead to intransitive preferences. Using process measures, the authors further show that buyers tend to interpret missing attribute values in a way that supports the purchase of the option that is superior on the common attribute. The results indicate that information presentation format and inferences about missing values cannot account for the observed effects of missing information on consumer choice. The authors also show that the purchase decisions of buyers who consider attribute importance before making a choice and those with high need for cognition are less susceptible to influence by missing information. Finally, the findings indicate that choosing from sets with missing information can affect buyer tastes and purchase decisions made subsequently.

Building on the foundations of the recently developed judgment uncertainty and magnitude parameters (JUMP) model, which statistically and simultaneously separates the drivers of judgment magnitude from those of judgment uncertainty, the authors present a model of the formation of uncertain intentions that decomposes a stated intention into a magnitude and an uncertainty dimension. The authors then develop hypotheses regarding the impact of affective and continuance commitment and critical sales events on intention magnitude and the effect of critical sales events and role stress on intention uncertainty. Subsequently, the authors develop a threshold model of the intention-behavior link that articulates a psychological mechanism within which uncertainty-laden intentions translate into actual behavior. Empirically, results from sales force intention and turnover data provide strong support for the theorizing. In addition to identifying some drivers of intention-to-quit magnitude and uncertainty, the authors identify the crucial role of intention uncertainty in shaping both the probability and timing of subsequent behavior. Consistent with the psychological underpinnings of the threshold model, the authors find that intention uncertainty lowers the probability of intended behavior. The results regarding the timing of quitting support an uncertainty avoidance conjecture: Given a stated intention, likely quitters with greater intention uncertainty quit faster than those with lower intention uncertainty.","Murali Chandrashekaran, Kevin McNeilly, Frederick A.

After qualitative data are collected, the judgment-based classification of items into categories is routinely used to summarize and communicate the information contained in the data. In this article, the authors provide marketing researchers with a method that (1) provides useful substantive information about the proportion and degree to which items belong to several categories and (2) measures the classification accuracy of the judges. The model is called the fuzzy latent class model (FLCM), because it extends Dillon and Mulani's (1984) latent class model by freeing it from the restrictive assumption that all items are crisp for a given categorization. Instead, FLCM allows for items to be either crisp or fuzzy. Crisp items belong exclusively to one category, whereas fuzzy items belong—in varying degree—to multiple categories. This relaxation in the assumption about the nature of qualitative data makes FLCM more widely applicable: Qualitative data in marketing research are often fuzzy, because they involve open-ended descriptions of complex phenomena. The authors also propose a moment-based measure of overall data fuzziness that is bounded by 0 (completely crisp) and 1 (completely fuzzy).","Sajeev Varki, Bruce Cooil, Roland T. Rust",,0

First, the approach is useful in applications of factor analysis in the presence of missing data. Second, the proposed factor analysis model may be used as a vehicle for imputing missing data, producing a complete data set that can be analyzed subsequently with some other method. Here, the factor model itself is not of primary interest but presents a suitable model for purposes of imputation. The proposed method accommodates various patterns of missing data commonly found in marketing. The framework for factor analysis the authors develop deals with both discrete and continuous variables and gives rise to several models not considered previously. The authors illustrate various factor models on synthetic data, investigating their performance when missing data are present and when the distribution of the observed variables is incorrectly specified. The authors provide two empirical studies of the performance of the approach. In the first, the authors demonstrate how the proposed approach recovers the true (complete-data) factor structure in the presence of missing observations that occur because of item nonresponse and compare the procedure with three alternative methods traditionally used for handling missing data in factor analysis.

These methods may seem to be minor variants of each other, yet they produce very different profiles of attribute weights when rank ordered from most to least important. The weights elicited by DR were more reliable than those elicited by PA in a test–retest situation. An important practical implication of this is for multicriteria decision making. Using people's test–retest data as attribute weights on simulated alternative values revealed that the same alternative would be chosen on 88% of occasions with DR, but only 74% of occasions with PA. Moreover, subjects reacted more favorably to DR than to PA.","Paul A. Bottomley, John R. Doyle, Rodney H. Green",,0

A multinomial/Dirichlet extension of the model that applies to repeat preference tests of two items provides a better fit than an alternative mixture model despite fewer parameters. To test two items and obtain an accuracy of +.05 with a 95% confidence interval for the mean preference intensities, a multinomial/Dirichlet model requires two paired comparisons (made at two points in time) per respondent and a sample size of 400; these requirements represent half the required number of preference measurements per respondent and half the required sample size of alternative methods. Although the illustrative examples refer to the comparison of known brands and unidentified products, the proposed methodology can be applied to many contexts, including the evaluation of product profiles in conjoint analysis.","Albert C.

Building Store Loyalty through Store Brands,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.37.3.281.18781,01-Aug-00,01-Aug-00,37,3,281,291,"In this article, the authors study the role of a store brand in building store loyalty through a game theoretic analysis. In a market in which a segment of consumers is sensitive to product quality and consumers' brand choice in low-involvement packaged goods categories is characterized by inertia, the authors show that quality store brands can be an instrument for retailers to generate store differentiation, store loyalty, and store profitability, even when the store brand does not have a margin advantage over the national brand. In addition, this loyalty argument does not apply for the “cheap and nasty” private label strategy. Such a private label policy, on the contrary, reinforces rather than reduces price competition among stores. Indeed, the quality of the store brand must be above a threshold level to create this opportunity. It also follows that quality store brands, when carried by competing retailers, can be an implicit coordination mechanism that enables all the retailers to become more profitable. Finally, a quality store brand policy is profitable only if a significant portion of shoppers buys the national brand. This surprising result establishes the complementary roles of store brands and national brands. The former create store differentiation and loyalty, whereas the latter enable the retailer to raise prices and increase store profitability. The authors provide empirical support for their thesis by using evidence from Europe and household-level scanner panel data from the United States and Canada.","Marcel Corstjens, Rajiv Lal",,0
Expanding to the Internet: Pricing and Communications Strategies When Firms Compete on Multiple Channels,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.37.3.292.18777,01-Aug-00,01-Aug-00,37,3,292,308,"The author shows how firms' pricing and communications strategies may be affected by the size of the Internet: Firms have incentives to facilitate consumer search on the Internet, but only as long as the Internet's reach is limited. As the Internet is used by more consumers, firms' pricing and communications strategies on the Internet will mirror the strategies they pursue in a conventional channel. Firms can increase their market power by strategically using information on multiple channels to achieve finer consumer segmentation. The author suggests directions the Internet might take and derives managerial implications. The findings generalize to other channels that enable firms to segment consumers and inform them at low cost.",Florian Zettelmeyer,,0
Cultural Variations in Country of Origin Effects,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.37.3.309.18778,01-Aug-00,01-Aug-00,37,3,309,317,"The authors examine the extent to which cultural orientation influences country of origin effects on product evaluations in two countries (Japan and the United States). Subjects were given attribute information about a mountain bike made in either Japan or the United States. The target product was described as either superior or inferior to competition. Respondents in Japan evaluated the product that originated in the home country (versus foreign country) more favorably regardless of product superiority. In contrast, respondents in the United States evaluated the product that originated in the home country more favorably only when the product was superior to competition. The authors explain these findings on the basis of the cultural psychological principles of individualism and collectivism. Specifically, the authors show that the vertical dimension of individualism and collectivism explains country of origin effects. The authors also discuss implications for global marketing strategies featuring country of origin.","Zeynep Gürhan-Canli, Durairaj Maheswaran",,7
The Effects of Analyzing Reasons for Brand Preferences: Disruption or Reinforcement?,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.37.3.318.18776,01-Aug-00,01-Aug-00,37,3,318,330,"Different streams of research offer seemingly conflicting predictions as to the effects of analyzing reasons for preferences on the attitude-behavior link. The authors apply these different theoretical accounts to a new product scenario and identify conditions under which analyzing reasons for brand preferences can increase or decrease the predictive value of reported preferences. Consistent with dual-process theories of persuasion, in Study 1 the authors find that reasons analysis increases the link between attitude and behavior when the measure of behavior closely follows attitude measurement. In contrast, and consistent with research by Wilson and colleagues (e.g., Wilson et al. 1989) on the disruptive effects of reasons analysis, the authors find that thinking about reasons significantly decreases the attitude–behavior correlation when the observed behavior occurs after a substantial delay. Study 2 not only replicates this finding but also suggests that the timing of the reasons task can be an important moderator of the disruption effect. Specifically, the authors draw on the literature on accountability effects to show that even when there is a delay between attitude and behavior measurement, reasons analysis leads to an increase in the attitude–behavior link, as long as reasons are analyzed after attitude measurement. Finally, in Study 3, the authors validate the account of the effects of reasons analysis by obtaining parallel findings for attitude persistence. Together, the studies offer preliminary advice to both practitioners and academics regarding the potential effects of asking consumers to think about why they like or dislike certain products.","Jaideep Sengupta, Gavan J.

A Connectionist Model of Brand–Quality Associations,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.37.3.331.18780,01-Aug-00,01-Aug-00,37,3,331,350,"Consumers use brand names and product features to predict the performance of products. Various learning models offer hypotheses about the source of these predictive associations. Spreading-activation models hypothesize that cues acquire predictive value as a consequence of being present during the acquisition of product performance information. Least mean squares connectionist models hypothesize that any one cue acquires predictive value only to the extent that it can predict differences in performance that are not already predicted by other available cues. Five studies in the context of portfolio-branding strategies provide evidence supporting a least mean squares connectionist model. As predicted by this model, results show that subbranding and ingredient-branding strategies can protect brands from dilution in some situations but can promote dilution in other situations.","Chris Janiszewski, Stijn M.J.

An Experimental and Theoretical Analysis of Price-Matching Refund Policies,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.37.3.351.18773,01-Aug-00,01-Aug-00,37,3,351,362,"Price-matching refund policies, or offers by firms to match competitor's prices, are common in both consumer and industrial marketing. Much of the previous theoretical work in economics suggests that price-matching refunds are associated with higher prices. In contrast, the trade press postulates that price-matching policies are associated with lower prices. Given these inconsistent views regarding price-matching policies, the authors experimentally examine how consumers view and interpret such policies and then develop a model that incorporates these consumer interpretations as well as asymmetries across stores. In the model, the asymmetry across stores is the key to deriving the conditions under which a signaling equilibrium exists in the presence of price-matching policies. The critical point is that the competition-reducing and price discrimination effects, which seem to form the basis of most of the previous theoretical literature, can be counteracted by the presence of differentiated firms and uninformed consumers. The model suggests that under some conditions, price-matching policies can lead to more intense price competition. Furthermore, all firms will not find it profitable to offer refunds, and consistent with consumer expectations, the firms with lower prices will offer refunds.","Sanjay Jain, Joydeep Srivastava",,0

The Estimation of Pre- and Postpromotion Dips with Store-Level Scanner Data,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.37.3.383.18782,01-Aug-00,01-Aug-00,37,3,383,395,"One of the mysteries of store-level scanner data modeling is the lack of a dip in sales in the weeks following a promotion. Researchers expect to find a postpromotion dip because analyses of household scanner panel data indicate that consumers tend to accelerate their purchases in response to a promotion—that is, they buy earlier and/or purchase larger quantities than they would in the absence of a promotion. Thus, there should also be a pronounced dip in store-level sales in the weeks following a promotion. However, researchers rarely find such dips at either the category or the brand level. Several arguments have been proposed to account for the lack of a postpromotion dip in store-level sales data and to explain why dips may be hidden. Because dips are difficult to detect by traditional models (and by a visual inspection of the data), the authors propose models that can account for a multitude of factors that together cause complex pre- and postpromotion dips. The authors use three alternative distributed lead and lag structures: an Almon model, an unrestricted dynamic effects model, and an exponential decay model. In each model, the authors include four types of price discounts: without any support, with display-only support, with feature-only support, and with feature and display support. The models are calibrated on store-level scanner data for two product categories: tuna and toilet tissue. The authors estimate the dip to be between 4 and 25% of the current sales effect, which is consistent with household-level studies.","Harald J. Van Heerde, Peter S.H. Leeflang, Dick R. Wittink",,6

They develop a theoretical framework that begins with a consumer's first-ever purchase in a product category and describes subsequent purchases as components of sequential purchasing stages. The theory is based on the notion that choices made by consumers new to a market are driven by two competing forces: consumers' desire to collect information about alternatives and their aversion to trying risky ones. These forces give rise to three stages of purchasing: an information collection stage that focuses initially on low-risk, big brand names; a stage in which information collection continues but is extended to lesser-known brands; and a stage of information consolidation leading to preference for the brands that provide the greatest utility. The authors use a logit-mixture model with time-varying parameters to capture the choice dynamics of different consumer segments. The results show the importance of accounting for product experience and learning when studying the dynamic choice processes of consumers new to a market. Insights from this study can help marketers tailor their marketing activities as consumers gain purchasing experience.","Carrie M. Heilman, Douglas Bowman, Gordon P. Wright",,0

The value of the method is illustrated by examining the prevailing finding in the marketing literature that market shares are stable over time.

The authors present a new viewing choice model, which differs from the traditional Rust-Alpert model in three ways: (1) It introduces a new show characteristic—the demographic characteristics of a show's cast; (2) it allows the preferences over the traditional show categories to be a function of both observable and unobservable individual characteristics; and (3) it allows the cost of switching among the viewing alternatives to vary across show types and individual characteristics. Cross-validated predictive testing shows that this model fits the data better than the Rust–Alpert model does. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that network executives can improve ratings by using this model.

Choosing What I Want versus Rejecting What I Do Not Want: An Application of Decision Framing to Product Option Choice Decisions,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.37.2.187.18731,01-May-00,01-May-00,37,2,187,202,"The authors examine the effects of using a subtractive versus an additive option-framing method on consumers' option choice decisions in three studies. The former option-framing method presents consumers with a fully loaded product and asks them to delete options they do not want. The latter presents them with a base model and asks them to add the options they do want. Combined, the studies support the managerial attractiveness of the subtractive versus the additive option-framing method. Consumers tend to choose more options with a higher total option price when they use subtractive versus additive option framing. This effect holds across different option price levels (Study 1) and product categories of varying price (Study 2). Moreover, this effect is magnified when subjects are asked to anticipate regret from their option choice decisions (Study 2). However, option framing has a different effect on the purchase likelihood of the product category itself, depending on the subject's initial interest in buying within the category. Although subtractive option framing offers strong advantages to managers when product commitment is high, it appears to demotivate category purchase when product commitment is low (Study 3). In addition, the three studies reveal several other findings about the attractiveness of subtractive versus additive option framing from the standpoint of consumers and managers. These findings, in turn, offer interesting public policy and future research implications.","C. Whan Park, Sung Youl Jun, Deborah J. Macinnis",,6

Control Mechanisms and the Relationship Life Cycle: Implications for Safeguarding Specific Investments and Developing Commitment,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.37.2.227.18735,01-May-00,01-May-00,37,2,227,245,"Powerful suppliers often require retailers to make significant idiosyncratic investments to improve coordination between organizations and to enhance the supplier's presence in the end market. The authors examine how a retailer might better manage the hold-up potential of these transaction-specific investments (TSIs) through the use of three control mechanisms: supplier's TSIs, the development of relational norms, and the use of explicit contracts. Moreover, the authors consider the time-dependent nature of these mechanisms by observing their effects on commitment over the course of a relationship life cycle. The results indicate that (1) a retailer's TSIs have a negative effect on its perceptions of supplier commitment; (2) a supplier's TSIs and relational norms increase the retailer's perception of supplier commitment, whereas explicit contracts are associated with perceptions of lower supplier commitment; and (3) each of the three control mechanisms moderates the negative impact of retailer investments on perceptions of supplier commitment contingent on the relationship phase. Specifically, bilateral TSIs enhance commitment in the exploration phase and a positive effect during the decline phase. The results also indicate that the retailer's perceptions of supplier commitment are positively related to its evaluation of supplier performance and satisfaction and negatively related to conflict.","Sandy D.

This approach facilitates addressing three managerial questions of direct importance: (1) Which assortment of a given size has the most customers for whom it is the preferred assortment (and what fraction of customers)? (2) Which products should be added to a given assortment to maximize the fraction of customers who can find their most preferred assortment? and (3) For a given assortment, what type of customer is likely to purchase it? The model is applied to assortment choices constructed from a set of eight popular magazines with five measured attributes: business, current events, human interest stories, sports, and technology. The analysis indicates that consumers are heterogeneous: Some customers are price sensitive and unresponsive to the magazine attributes, and others are sensitive to the magazine features but do not necessarily want more of them. In addition, the authors observe that many subjects do not prefer varied assortments; rather, consumers focus on purchasing magazines with high levels of the attribute they want.","Eric T.

Buyer–Supplier Contracts versus Joint Ventures: Determinants and Consequences of Transaction Structure,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.37.1.1.18719,01-Feb-00,01-Feb-00,37,1,1,15,"When a buyer firm and a supplier firm plan to transact, what factors drive their choice of mechanism to govern the relationship? Focusing on contract-governed versus joint venture–governed relationships, the authors present a theoretical framework that specifies the conditions that make one or the other form of relationship structure more appropriate. This study was designed to address potential limitations regarding measurement, financial consequences, and context in the extant literature. The authors employ measures derived from Standard & Poor's Compustat financial database and an overall measure of firm reputation to examine empirically differences in firm characteristics across the two types of relationships. To examine the financial consequences of relationship structure, the authors use event-study techniques that tie stock price reactions to the governance mechanism choice. The results suggest that buyers and suppliers are more likely to form a joint venture (versus simple contract) when (1) the supplier's degree of asset specificity is high, (2) monitoring the supplier's behavior is difficult, and (3) the supplier has a poorer reputation. The authors find that vertical joint ventures (between buyers and suppliers) are economically similar to contracts, to the extent that abnormal wealth gains go solely to the supplier firms. Horizontal joint ventures (partners are at the same level of the value chain), however, provide bilateral, synergistic wealth gains. The results suggest that buyers and suppliers can use joint ventures to reduce certain governance problems rather than to gain synergies.","Mark B. Houston, Shane A. Johnson",,0
The Emergence of Market Structure in New Repeat-Purchase Categories: The Interplay of Market Share and Retailer Distribution,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.37.1.16.18723,01-Feb-00,01-Feb-00,37,1,16,31,"The authors study brand-share dynamics among competing brands in new repeat-purchase categories. In such new categories, market shares are strongly affected by retailer distribution decisions. Because a retailer that considers a brand for distribution can take into account the prior performance of that brand with other retailers, the success of a manufacturer in obtaining distribution can depend positively on its brand's market share to date. This creates positive feedback between a brand's market share and its distribution over the growth stage of the category. Temporary positive feedback, along with the way manufacturers influence their brand's market share and distribution, is hypothesized to drive the emergence of the market structure. The authors model this feedback to quantify the evolution of a brand's coupled market share and distribution. Empirical results using data from the U.S. ready-to-drink tea category suggest that positive feedback between market share and distribution exists in the early growth stage of the category. Therefore, early in the life of the new category small short-term changes in market share or distribution may generate larger long-term changes in market share and distribution. Later, such momentum appears absent. In this context, the authors discuss how a late entrant fails to capture a sizeable share of the market.","Bart J. Bronnenberg, Vijay Mahajan, Wilfried R.

Building on research on elaboration, the authors propose that the relative salience of hedonic dimensions is greater when consumers decide which of several items to give up (forfeiture choices) than when they decide which item to acquire (acquisition choices). The resulting hypothesis that a hedonic item is relatively preferred over the same utilitarian item in forfeiture choices than in acquisition choices was supported in two choice experiments. In a subsequent experiment, these findings were extended to hypothetical choices in which the acquisition and forfeiture conditions were created by manipulating initial attribute-level reference states instead of ownership. Finally, consistent with the experimental findings, a field survey showed that, relative to market prices, owners of relatively hedonic cars value their vehicles more than do owners of relatively utilitarian cars. The authors discuss theoretical implications of these reference-dependent preference asymmetries and explore consequences for marketing managers and other decision makers.","Ravi Dhar, Klaus Wertenbroch",,53

The first model form captures individual heterogeneity by a latent class structure. The second model form captures individual heterogeneity by postulating that the brand-choice probabilities follow a Dirichlet distribution, which yields the popular Dirichlet multinomial formulation. Monte Carlo simulations are performed with a view toward assessing whether individual transition probabilities can be captured from knowledge of only aggregated brand choices. Results indicate that the proposed method can indeed capture individual brand-transition probabilities under several different conditions. An empirical application illustrates how these models can be used to provide important information on individual brand transitions and the role of marketing-related covariates.","Ulf Böckenholt, William R.

A New Dimension Reduction Approach for Data-Rich Marketing Environments: Sliced Inverse Regression,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.37.1.88.18715,01-Feb-00,01-Feb-00,37,1,88,101,"In data-rich marketing environments (e.g., direct marketing or new product design), managers face an ever-growing need to reduce the number of variables effectively. To accomplish this goal, the authors introduce a new method called sliced inverse regression (SIR), which finds factors by taking into account the information contained in both the dependent and independent variables. Sliced inverse regression objectively identifies appropriate factors through simple statistical tests for determining the number of factors to retain and for assessing the significance of factor-loading coefficients. The authors make conceptual connections between SIR and several existing approaches, including principal components regression (PCR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR). Using Monte Carlo experiments, the authors demonstrate that SIR performs better than these approaches. Two empirical examples—designing a new executive business program and direct marketing by a catalog company—are presented to illustrate the application of SIR and to show that it outperforms both PLSR and PCR in these cases. In addition, the authors discuss how direct marketers can apply SIR to analyze large databases and to thus target customers effectively.

Monte Carlo studies show that the magnitude of bias can be serious when conventional estimation methods, such as ordinary least squares and errors in variables, are employed to obtain parameter estimates. Therefore, the authors have developed two new approaches that either reduce or eliminate parameter bias. Using these methods, advertisers can determine an unbiased optimal advertising budget, even if advertising variables are measured with error.

Systematic Impact of Behavioral Frequency and Duration on Survey Response Errors,https://doi.org/10.1509/jmkr.37.1.125.18724,01-Feb-00,01-Feb-00,37,1,125,133,"Using a large-scale consumer database created by AT&T, the authors investigate how actual behavioral frequency and duration systematically affect the direction of errors in consumer survey responses. By analyzing errors in consumers' reports on their frequency of using long-distance telephone calls, letters, cards, and visits for personal communication, the authors demonstrate that high-frequency groups underreported their behavioral frequencies, whereas low-frequency groups overreported them. Similarly, the results show that consumers underestimate the duration of lengthy telephone conversations, whereas they overestimate the duration of short ones. Overall, the authors find that people tend to overestimate both frequency and duration. These compressive regressive effects toward the mean and overall upward bias for both frequency and duration estimations result in a distorted view of the market, which will be incorrectly perceived to be more homogeneous and larger than it really is.","Eunkyu Lee, Michael Y.

This principle, however, is easier to accept than it is to execute, because long-run effects of marketing spending are difficult to estimate. The authors address this problem by examining the behavior of market response and marketing spending over time and identify four common strategic scenarios: business as usual, hysteresis in response, escalation, and evolving business practice. The authors explain and illustrate why each scenario can occur in practice and describe its positive and negative consequences for long-term profitability. The authors propose to use multivariate persistence measures to identify which of the four strategic scenarios is taking place and illustrate this approach in the pharmaceutical and packaged-food industries. The results substantiate the authors’ proposition that the strategic scenario is a major determinant of marketing effectiveness and long-term profitability. This conclusion sets up a substantial agenda for further research.","Marnik G. Dekimpe, Dominique M. Hanssens",,1
Estimating Price Elasticities with Theory-Based Priors,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379903600402,01-Nov-99,01-Nov-99,36,4,413,423,"The authors show how price elasticity estimates can be improved in demand systems that involve multiple brands and stores. They treat these demand models in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Unlike in more standard Bayesian hierarchical treatments, the authors use prior information based on the restrictions imposed by additive utility models. In an additive utility model approach, price elasticities are driven by a general substitution parameter as well as brand-specific expenditure elasticities. The authors employ a differential shrinkage approach in which price elasticities are held closely to the restrictions of the additive utility theory and store-to-store variation is accommodated through differences in expenditure elasticities. Application of these new methods to simulated and real store scanner data shows significant improvements over existing Bayesian and non–Bayesian methods.","Alan L. Montgomery, Peter E. Rossi",,0
Visual Attention to Repeated Print Advertising: A Test of Scanpath Theory,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379903600403,01-Nov-99,01-Nov-99,36,4,424,438,"The authors examine consumers’ visual attention during repeated exposures to print advertisements using eye-tracking methodology.

These measures are vital to understanding attention wear-out and the impact of repetition on advertising effectiveness but have not been considered in previous research. The results of two studies show that (1) attention duration decreases significantly across advertising repetitions and (2) attentional scanpaths, as measured through saccades, remain constant across advertising repetitions and across experimentally induced and naturally occurring conditions. Scanpaths obey a stationary, reversible, first-order Markov process. The authors offer implications for attention theory and advertising processing.","Rik Pieters, Edward Rosbergen, Michel Wedel",,0

This article contributes to the emerging body of knowledge in this important arena. Building from theories of relationships and empirical research across several disciplines, the authors specify six key underlying dimensions (connectors) that characterize the manner in which buyers and sellers relate and conduct relationships. Measures for these relationship connectors (information exchange, operational linkages, legal bonds, cooperation, and relationship-specific adaptations by buyers and sellers) are developed in a series of pretests. Then, on the basis of relationship profiles for more than 400 buyer–seller relationships sampled from a wide array of industries and market situations, the authors apply numerical taxonomy to develop an empirically based classification of different types of business relationships. Contrary to approaches used in much of the extant literature, taxonomic methods do not rely on an assumption that the connectors are highly intercorrelated or that they combine in some linear fashion to form a single underlying dimension. Furthermore, the research specifies antecedent market and purchase situations and shows that they affect when specific types of relationships are used. The research also shows how customer satisfaction and evaluations of supplier performance vary across different types of relationships. The results provide new insights about the nature of relationships in business markets.","Joseph P. Cannon, William D. Perreault, Jr.",,0

Investigating Household State Dependence Effects across Categories,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379903600407,01-Nov-99,01-Nov-99,36,4,488,500,"Brand choices over time are dictated not just by households’ intrinsic brand preferences, but also by marketing variables and state dependence effects. The authors examine brand choice behavior across five product categories as a function of these variables. Choice within a category is modeled with a multinomial probit model. A Bayesian variance components approach is used to model the covariation of household response parameters across categories. The model enables the authors to identify similarities in households’ state dependence effects across categories. On the basis of purchase data from a panel of 785 households, they also (1) estimate the correlations between household parameters for the marketing mix and state dependence, (2) study whether state dependence effects diminish over time, (3) investigate whether state dependence for a household is related to its demographic and behavioral characteristics, and (4) analyze whether category variables influence state dependence.
The results indicate that households display similar state dependence effects across the five categories, with two categories exhibiting significantly lower state dependence levels than the other three. Furthermore, significant correlations exist between state dependence effects and marketing mix sensitivities. A household's level of brand choice inertia diminishes with time elapsed since the previous purchase. State dependence is influenced by shopping behavior variables but not by demographics.","P.B.

To help isolate potentially noisy variables prior to clustering, the authors discuss a new algorithm, the Heuristic Identification of Noisy Variables (HINoV). They demonstrate its robustness with artificial data. In addition, the authors illustrate the potential of HINoV to yield more managerially useful market segments (clusters) when applied to two real marketing data sets. Implementation of HINoV is straightforward and will help avoid a major problem in using K-means cluster analysis for market segment definition, as well as for other similar types of research.","Frank J.

Using these conditions, the author demonstrates that whereas the linear and all concave consumer demand functions lead to less than 100% optimal retail pass-through, there exists a subset of convex consumer demand functions for which a retailer rationally engages in greater than 100% pass-through. This subset contains many commonly used demand functions, such as the constant elasticity demand function, the negative exponential demand function, and many other varying elasticity demand functions.",Rajeev K.

The first demonstrates that (1) exposure to brand extensions facilitates the speed with which subjects can categorize parent brands correctly, (2) this result is moderated by parent brand dominance such that nondominant brands benefit more from such exposure, and (3) extension fit moderates this effect for nondominant but not for dominant parent brands.

Although practitioners have assumed that event sponsors are identified primarily through pure recollection, the authors show that sponsor identification involves a substantial degree of construction. Results from three experiments indicate that sponsor identification is biased toward brands that are prominent in the marketplace and semantically related to the event. These biases appear to emanate from constructive processes whereby, during identification, respondents use the prominence and relatedness of available brands as heuristics to verify their recollection of event-sponsor associations. The effects of relatedness on sponsor identification seem stronger and more robust than those of prominence, which appears to be invoked only for large events. Both effects are robust across methods of identification assessment though less pronounced when the accuracy threshold is high.","Gita Venkataramani Johar, Michel Tuan Pham",,0

In this article, the authors examine the interplay of expectations based on perceptual inputs versus experiences based on sensory input in the context of volume perceptions. Specifically, they examine biases in the perception of volume due to container shape. The height of the container emerges as a vital dimension that consumers appear to use as a simplifying visual heuristic to make a volume judgment. However, perceived consumption, contrary to perceived volume, is related inversely to height. This lowered perceived consumption is hypothesized and shown to increase actual consumption. A series of seven laboratory experiments programmatically test model predictions. Results show that perceived volume, perceived consumption, and actual consumption are related sequentially. Furthermore, the authors show that container shape affects preference, choice, and postconsumption satisfaction. The authors discuss theoretical implications for contrast effects when expectancies are disconfirmed, specifically as they relate to biases in visual information processing, and provide managerial implications of the results for package design, communication, and pricing.","Priya Raghubir, Aradhna Krishna",,8
New Product Introduction and Incumbent Response Strategies: Their Interrelationship and the Role of Multimarket Contact,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379903600303,01-Aug-99,01-Aug-99,36,3,327,344,"In this article, the author studies the determinants of both new product introduction and incumbent response strategies in a single integrated framework.

To test these hypotheses, the author formulates models of introduction and response strategies, including an anticipated incumbent reaction formation model. The results of the empirical analysis show that new product introduction strategy is influenced significantly by incumbent reaction strategy, and vice versa. The relationship of a new product's marketing spending to the anticipated incumbent reaction is different for incumbents of different sizes. The analysis shows that higher spending by a new brand results in incumbent response that is significantly lower in magnitude.

Brand Equity Dilution: Retailer Display and Context Brand Effects,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379903600304,01-Aug-99,01-Aug-99,36,3,345,355,"Consistency among the various elements of a marketing program is believed essential in building and maintaining brand image and equity. And yet, a brand's ultimate presentation to customers is controlled more often by the retailer than by the manufacturer. In this research, the authors demonstrate that the retailer's display decisions can negate the equity of an established brand. The authors suggest that this occurs because consumers have expectations about retail displays and the relationship among displayed brands. Display conditions that disconfirm these expectations can lead consumers to reevaluate the brand. Specifically, the results demonstrate that high-equity brand valuations are influenced by an unfamiliar context brand when (1) a mixed display structure leads consumers to believe that the context brand is diagnostic for judging the high-equity brand, (2) the precedence given to one brand over another in the display makes expectations about brand differences or similarities accessible, and (3) the unfamiliar context brand disconfirms these expectations.","Lauranne Buchanan, Carolyn J.

The research employs a mixed-design experiment, conducted using a survey method, in which customers evaluate various failure/recovery scenarios and complete a questionnaire with respect to an organization they recently had patronized. The authors execute the research in the context of two different service settings, restaurants and hotels. The results show that customers prefer to receive recovery resources that “match” the type of failure they experience in “amounts” that are commensurate with the magnitude of the failure that occurs.

Model estimation allows for the relationship between consumer choice and postchoice behavior.

Emotional Trade-Off Difficulty and Choice,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379903600201,01-May-99,01-May-99,36,2,143,159,"In this article, the authors explore whether choice patterns are sensitive to the potential of relevant trade-offs to elicit negative emotion. Across three experiments, decision makers increasingly use a choice strategy that maximizes quality at the expense of some currency (usually price) when the quality attribute is rated as more inherently emotion-laden (Experiment 1) or involves losses rather than gains (Experiments 2 and 3). These emotional trade-off difficulty effects on choice are obtained even after controlling for effects that are attributable to subjects’ relative importance weights for the quality versus currency attributes. A fourth experiment validates that tasks requiring losses (versus gains) on quality attributes are assessed as particularly emotion-laden by naïve subjects. Overall, it appears that coping with potentially emotion-laden choice trade-offs is one factor influencing consumer choice strategies. Thus, emotional trade-off difficulty is a factor that marketers should consider when attempting to predict and explain consumer choice patterns. These conclusions are consistent with recent research that argues that avoiding or otherwise coping with negative emotion is an important goal that guides decision behavior (e.g., Larrick 1993; Luce, Bettman, and Payne 1997; Simonson 1992).","Mary Frances Luce, John W.

In this article, the authors develop and test a dynamic model of customer usage of services, identifying causal links between customer's prior usage levels, satisfaction evaluations, and subsequent service usage. The authors quantify the (heretofore anecdotal) relationship between customer satisfaction and subsequent service usage and provide new theoretical insights into the antecedents of customer satisfaction by introducing the concept of perceived payment equity. The primary contribution of the article is an understanding of how service usage changes over time, and particularly, how the consumer's view of the fairness or “equity” of the exchange over time affects the consumer's usage of services. Specifically, payment equity represents the customer's changing evaluation of the fairness of the level of economic benefits derived from usage in relation to the level of economic costs, that is, the customer's evaluation of the fairness of the exchange. By examining the antecedents of payment equity, it can be determined how customers use price and usage over time to update their evaluations of the fairness of the exchange. This evaluation affects overall satisfaction, which in turn affects future usage. The results suggest that customers’ usage levels can be managed through pricing strategies, communications, and more generally dynamic customer satisfaction management.","Ruth N. Bolton, Katherine N.

Prior to the research presented here, the only established causal antecedent of perceived price unfairness was increased relative profit. In Study 1, the author extends the existing research by demonstrating that the inferred motive, as well as inferred relative profit, provides causal explanation of perceived price unfairness. When participants inferred that the firm had a negative motive for a price increase, the increase was perceived as significantly less fair than the same increase when participants inferred that the firm had a positive motive. In addition, the author shows in Study 2 that the firm's reputation can influence the inferred motive, thereby altering perceptions of price unfairness. Specifically, participants sometimes gave a firm with a good reputation the benefit of the doubt when inferring motive. If the “good” firm did not profit from the price increase, participants inferred significantly more positive motives than if it did profit. The firm with a poor reputation did not receive this benefit; inferred motive was equally negative regardless of whether the firm profited from the price increase. Together, these studies provide evidence that consumer inferences of the motive for a price increase influence the perceived fairness of the increase. Furthermore, reputation is shown to moderate the effect of inferred relative profit on inferred motive. Finally, analyses show that perceived unfairness leads to lower shopping intentions and demonstrate that perceived unfairness mediates the effects of inferred motive and relative price on consumers’ shopping intentions.",Margaret C.

When Do Price Promotions Affect Pretrial Brand Evaluations?,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379903600206,01-May-99,01-May-99,36,2,211,222,"The authors investigate the conditions in which price promotions affect pretrial brand evaluations. A price promotion is theorized to be informative about brand quality when it stands out because it deviates from either its own past behavior or industry norms.

The authors describe three laboratory studies in the context of a price promotion that is designed to increase trial in a service industry. Results suggest that consistency with past promotional behavior, distinctiveness in terms of how common it is to promote in an industry, and consumer expertise are important variables that moderate when price promotions have an unfavorable effect on brand evaluations.

Signaling Unobservable Product Quality through a Brand Ally,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379903600209,01-May-99,01-May-99,36,2,258,268,"In this article, the authors examine the circumstances in which brand names convey information about unobservable quality. They argue that a brand name can convey unobservable quality credibly when false claims will result in intolerable economic losses. These losses can occur for two reasons: (1) losses of reputation or sunk investments and (2) losses of future profits that occur whether or not the brand has a reputation. The authors test this assertion in the context of the emerging practice of brand alliances. Results from several studies are supportive of the premise and suggest that, when evaluating a product that has an important unobservable attribute, consumers’ quality perceptions are enhanced when a brand is allied with a second brand that is perceived to be vulnerable to consumer sanctions. The authors discuss the theoretical and substantive implications for the area of brand management.","Akshay R. Rao, Lu Qu, Robert W. Ruekert",,0
The Advantages of Entry in the Growth Stage of the Product Life Cycle: An Empirical Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379903600210,01-May-99,01-May-99,36,2,269,276,"In this article, the authors examine how the stage of product life cycle in which a brand enters affects its sales through brand growth and market response, after controlling for the order-of-entry effect and time in market. The authors develop a dynamic brand sales model in which brand growth and market response parameters vary by stage of life cycle entry, namely, by pioneers, growth-stage entrants, and mature-stage entrants. The authors estimate the model using data on 29 brands from six pharmaceutical markets.
The results reveal advantages associated with entering during the growth stage. Growth-stage entrants reach their asymptotic sales level faster than pioneers or mature-stage entrants, are not hurt by competitor diffusion, and enjoy a higher response to perceived product quality than pioneers and mature-stage entrants. Pioneers reach their asymptotic sales levels more slowly than later entrants, and pioneer's sales, unlike later entrants’ sales, are hurt by competitor diffusion over time. On the positive side for pioneers, buyers are most responsive to marketing spending by pioneers. Mature-stage entrants are most disadvantaged; they grow more slowly than growth-stage entrants, have lower response to product quality than growth-stage entrants, and have the lowest response to marketing spending.","Venkatesh Shankar, Gregory S.

A Comparison of Multidimensional Scaling Methods for Perceptual Mapping,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379903600211,01-May-99,01-May-99,36,2,277,285,"Multidimensional scaling has been applied to a wide range of marketing problems, in particular to perceptual mapping based on dissimilarity judgments. The introduction of methods based on the maximum likelihood principle is one of the most important developments. In this article, the authors compare the three available Maximum Likelihood Multidimensional Scaling (MLMDS) methods, namely, MULTISCALE, MAXSCAL, and PROSCAL, and the traditional multidimensional scaling (MDS) method KYST in a Monte Carlo study with 243 synthetic data sets. The MLMDS methods outperform KYST with respect to recovering the perceptual maps. MAXSCAL recovers the true distances between brands somewhat better than MULTISCALE, which is somewhat better than PROSCAL. With regard to distance recovery, the MLMDS methods are quite robust to violations of distributional assumptions. The decision criteria for selecting the number of dimensions are less robust to distributional violations. The results support the use of Consistent Akaike Information Criterion for the selection of the number of dimensions. The authors recommend that dissimilarity judgments be collected on interval scales or on ordinal scales with a substantial number of scale values. The authors discuss implications of the results for the design and analysis of perceptual mapping studies.","Tammo H.A. Bijmolt, Michel Wedel",,0

That is, the authors show how the nonresponse bias associated with asking people about their prior survey participation can be removed. They propose and validate a simple yet powerful statistical model of survey contact across the U.S. population and of survey response among those contacted. The authors find that survey contact and participation rates are lower than previously assumed and that a small percentage of the population is completing the majority of surveys.","Barbara Bickart, David Schmittlein",,0

International Market Segmentation Based on Consumer–Product Relations,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379903600101,01-Feb-99,01-Feb-99,36,1,1,17,"With increasing competition in the global marketplace, international segmentation has become an ever more important issue in developing, positioning, and selling products across national borders. The authors propose a methodology to identify cross-national market segments, based on means–end chain theory. The methodology offers the potential for integrating product development and communication strategies by linking product characteristics to consumer benefits and values. For that purpose, a model is developed that identifies relations between the consumer and the product at the segment level, which increases the actionability and responsiveness of the segments. The model accounts for different response tendencies, across and within countries, that commonly hamper identification of cross-national segments. A Monte Carlo study shows that the model performs well in recovering the parameters across a wide range of conditions. The segmentation model is applied to consumer data on yogurt collected in 11 countries of the European Union. Four international segments are identified and found to be related to consumer sociodemographics, consumption patterns, media consumption, and personality. The authors show that the model has high predictive validity and outperforms the standard clustering approaches traditionally employed in international segmentation.","Frenkel Ter Hofstede, Jan-Benedict E.M.

The Use of Visual Mental Imagery in New Product Design,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379903600102,01-Feb-99,01-Feb-99,36,1,18,28,"In this research, the authors seek to advance the understanding of how marketing can facilitate the new product design process. They focus on how designers’ use of a specific cognitive process, visual mental imagery, can influence the customer appeal of a design. The authors present a conceptual framework for examining how visual imagery might influence the customer appeal of a design output. This is followed by two experiments that test the hypotheses that flow from the proposed model. The experiments manipulate the type of visual imagery used and the incorporation of the customer in the imagery invoked and then examine its effects on the usefulness, originality, and customer appeal of the resulting design. Consistent with the framework and the proposed hypotheses, the findings show that including the customer in imagination visual imagery during the design process has a greater effect on the usefulness of the design produced than including the customer in memory visual imagery. The results also show that imagery based on imagination results in more original designs than imagery based on memory. Most important, the use of bounded imagination, which results from the incorporation of the visual images of the customer in imagination imagery, leads to the creation of designs that are more appealing to the customer. The findings are integrated into a discussion that clarifies the role of visual imagery in design and underscores the potential of this cognitive tool in the new product design process.","Darren W.

The authors investigate consumption episode effects, whereby the attribute levels of one component affect the chosen levels of another component (e.g., the effect of consuming a tasty, unhealthy entree on the experience and likelihood of choosing a tasty, unhealthy dessert). Building on a distinction between goals and resources, the authors propose that (1) in episodes involving a tradeoff between a goal (e.g., pleasure) and a resource (e.g., money), consumers tend to highlight either goal fulfillment or resource conservation by selecting similar attribute levels for items consumed in the same episode (e.g., a tasty, expensive appetizer and a tasty, expensive entree on one occasion and less tasty, less expensive items on another occasion) and (2) if each choice involves a tradeoff between two goals (e.g., pleasure and good health), consumers tend to balance attribute levels (e.g., in each episode have one tasty item and one healthy item). These predictions are supported in a series of studies, with a total of approximately 2650 respondents, that also examined rival explanations and the boundaries of consumption episode effects. The authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings.","Ravi Dhar, Itamar Simonson",,1

The current research focuses on the influence of the malleable self-concept on consumer attitudes toward a brand, based on the its personality associations. The results of two experiments demonstrate that traits that are made accessible by salient situational cues and those that are chronically accessible (schematic traits) positively influence consumer attitudes toward a brand based on its personality associations. More important, these effects are tested in a set of theory-based interactions that rely on the self-monitoring individual difference variable. Self congruity is enhanced for low versus high self-monitoring subjects, whereas situation congruity is enhanced for high versus low self-monitoring subjects. Together, these experiments shed light on the self-expressive use of brands and the role of the malleable self-concept in influencing consumer attitudes.",Jennifer L. Aaker,,0

Understanding how Product Attributes Influence Product Categorization: Development and Validation of Fuzzy Set-Based Measures of Gradedness in Product Categories,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379903600106,01-Feb-99,01-Feb-99,36,1,75,94,"Products vary in the degree to which they are members of product categories. Understanding how product attributes influence product categorization is important for marketing decisions about product development, brand extension, and product positioning. Existing attribute-level measures of product attitude emphasize evaluation rather than categorization. Measures of category membership either are at the overall product level or emphasize feature-based attributes, whereas product attributes are often continuous in nature. A comprehensive approach for conceptualizing product categorization is provided by fuzzy set theory, with its basic postulate that no clear boundaries exist between members and nonmembers of a fuzzy set. The authors conceptualize product categories as fuzzy sets in which products have degrees of membership along specific attributes, argued to arise as a result of the degree to which a product possesses an attribute. Two fuzzy set-based measures of category membership are developed that assess gradedness of category membership at the attribute level, which is then combined across attributes to reach overall measures of gradedness for a product. The results of a study demonstrate the validity of these measures and illustrate important attribute-level analyses that are not possible with existing approaches.","Madhubalan Viswanathan, Terry L.

"Market Motives, Distinctive Capabilities, and Domestic Inertia: A Hybrid Model of Innovation Generation",https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379903600107,01-Feb-99,01-Feb-99,36,1,95,112,"The authors develop and test a model of innovation in which the generative process of innovation is fostered by a balance of three forces: market motives, distinctive capabilities, and domestic inertia. The authors distinguish between potential and realized competition and, focusing on interinnovation duration as the dependent variable, develop hypotheses to capture the effects of competition, feedback from the marketplace, and product characteristics on innovation dynamics. Weekly diffusion and innovation data for 11 computer software products available on the Internet, involving more than 100 new versions in the period 1991 to 1994, are used to test the hypotheses. Model comparison tests provide strong support for the hybrid model over models based on restricted conceptualizations. Domestic inertia considerations explain 45% of the variance in interinnovation duration, and market motives and distinctive capabilities explain 33% and 22%, respectively. The authors support the expectation of a U-shaped effect of potential competition and find that realized competition increases interinnovation duration. Products that are more customer-driven witness faster innovation, and the diffusion rate of a current innovation plays a significant role in future innovative activities: It moderates the effect of potential competition and interacts with product bundling to delay innovation. Furthermore, the authors find that product bundling per se does not influence innovation activities and that, when a product is enjoying a high rate of diffusion, competition does not hasten the arrival of innovations.","Murali Chandrashekaran, Raj Mehta, Rajesh Chandrashekaran,...",,0

To explain their result, Moorman, Zaltman, and Deshpandé (1992) suggest that, as a relationship becomes more long-term, it becomes prone to negative influences that dampen the positive impact of relational factors.

The results replicate findings on seven of ten hypotheses proposed in the original article.

In three experiments, the authors show that attributes that differentiate later entrants from the first entrant are better remembered and listed more often in judgment formation protocols if the attributes are comparable along some common aspect (i.e., they are alignable differences) than if they do not correspond to any attributes of the first entrant (i.e., they are nonalignable differences). The impact of greater memorability of alignable over nonalignable differences is that later entrants whose attributes are superior to those of the first entrant can come to be preferred over the first entrant when the attributes are alignable differences but not when they are nonalignable differences. These findings have important implications for product entry, differentiation, and positioning strategies.","Shi Zhang, Arthur B. Markman",,0

In a marketing setting, consumers often are promised a delayed reward, contingent on the performance of future effort. In such situations, the author proposes that at the time of brand choice, the future effort is underweighted, relative to the future savings. Consequently, an incentive that appears attractive at the time of brand choice may appear unattractive at the time of redemption. The author hypothesizes and experimentally demonstrates the effect of face value, level of effort, and temporal delay on choice, redemption, and profits. Results show that temporal delay between choice and redemption causes a systematic underweighting of future effort, which mediates the increased attractiveness of alternatives with delayed incentives.

When relatively equivocal information about two hypothetical brands is acquired one attribute at a time, the evaluation of a subsequent attribute is distorted to support the brand that emerges as the leader. This distortion in favor of the leading brand occurs in the absence of any prior brand preference and even when no choice is required. In the latter case, brand preference is formed spontaneously and privately. The magnitude of this predecisional information distortion is roughly double the well-known postdecisional distortion due to cognitive dissonance. A second study shows that, even when the product information is diagnostic, substantial distortion remains. Furthermore, when the diagnostic information leads to a reversal of the currently preferred brand, distortion reappears in support of the new leading brand. The implications of predecisional distortion of product information are discussed for the presentation order of brands, the presentation format of product attributes, and the potential bias in preference assessment techniques, such as conjoint measurement, that rely on pairwise choices.","J.

The authors test hypotheses of how consumers process partitioned prices and how partitioned pricing affects consumers’ processing and recall of total costs and their purchase intentions and certain types of demand. The results suggest that partitioned prices decrease consumers’ recalled total costs and increase their demand.

The authors find that the typicality of the extension and consumers’ level of motivation determine the effect of extensions on family brand name. In high-motivation conditions, incongruent extensions are scrutinized in detail and lead to the modification of family brand evaluations, regardless of the typicality of the extensions. However, in low-motivation conditions, brand evaluations are more extreme in the context of high (versus low) typicality. The less typical extension is considered an exception, which reduces its impact on evaluations. Results also show that brand name dilution or enhancement can occur in response to congruent extensions.

Using a two-stage game model with a diffusion effect, the authors analytically investigate whether this is always an optimal strategy. They identify several market and competitive conditions in which it might be optimal for firms to target the Majority rather than the Innovators.

Accordingly, the authors develop a general model of how consumers process and respond to trial experiences. This trial model then is integrated with a well-known advertising model to trace how (1) consumers react when both types of information are available and (2) advertising achieves its influence on trial perceptions. The authors estimate these models for two products that vary significantly in the diagnosticity of the trial experience and discuss implications for marketing research and practice.","Deanna S.

An Empirical Analysis of Umbrella Branding,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379803500305,01-Aug-98,01-Aug-98,35,3,339,351,"In this article, the author studies the processes by which consumers’ quality perceptions of a brand in a product category are affected by their experience with the same brand in a different category. The model proposed and estimated explicitly incorporates some of the basic consumer behavior premises of signaling theory of umbrella branding (Montgomery and Wernerfelt 1992; Wernerfelt 1988). The author provides a framework to analyze the impact of marketing mix strategies in one product category on quality perceptions, consumer perceived risk, and consumer choice behavior in a different category. The model is estimated on panel data for two oral hygiene products, toothpaste and toothbrushes, in which a subset of brands share the same brand name across the two product categories. The results show strong support for the consumer premises of the signaling theory of umbrella branding.",Tülin Erdem,,6
Determining Where to Shop: Fixed and Variable Costs of Shopping,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379803500306,01-Aug-98,01-Aug-98,35,3,352,369,"The authors develop and test a new model of store choice behavior whose basic premise is that each shopper is more likely to visit the store with the lowest total shopping cost. The total shopping cost is composed of fixed and variable costs. The fixed cost is independent of, whereas the variable cost depends on, the shopping list (i.e., the products and their respective quantities to be purchased). Besides travel distance, the fixed cost includes a shopper's inherent preference for the store and historic store loyalty. The variable cost is a weighted sum of the quantities of items on the shopping list multiplied by their expected prices at the store. The article has three objectives: (1) to model and estimate the relative importance of fixed and variable shopping costs, (2) to investigate customer segmentation in response to shopping costs, and (3) to introduce a new measure (the basket size threshold) that defines competition between stores from a shopping cost perspective. The model controls for two important phenomena: Consumer shopping lists might differ from the collection of goods ultimately bought, and shoppers might develop category-specific store loyalty.","David R.

Exploring the Determinants of Broadway Show Success,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379803500307,01-Aug-98,01-Aug-98,35,3,370,383,"This study investigates the determinants of success of an experiential good: Broadway shows. The authors focus on the sources and types of information used in the selection of an artistic event and discuss the impact of critics’ reviews on the length of a show's run and attendance. In addition, the authors empirically determine the influence of other variables, such as previews, newspaper advertising, ticket prices, show type, talent characteristics, and timing of opening. The results indicate that New York newspaper theater critics have a significant impact on the success of Broadway shows. It is also found that the newspaper critics have a differential impact, with the critic from the New York Times yielding nearly twice as much influence as critics from the Daily News or the New York Post. Theater critics, it appears, are not only predictors but influencers as well. Among the various show types, musicals appear to fare better than other categories of shows. Previews have a significant impact on the attendance, but not on the longevity, of Broadway shows. Advertising also has a significant impact on both longevity and attendance. However, the characteristics of the key talent do not have a consistently significant influence on show success. In addition, ticket prices do not have a significant relationship with either longevity or attendance. The results indicate that there is an overwhelming impact of information sources, particularly the influence of critics’ reviews, on the success of Broadway shows. The authors discuss the implications of these results for the theater industry.","Srinivas K. Reddy, Vanitha Swaminathan, Carol M. Motley",,0
On the Heterogeneity of Demand,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379803500308,01-Aug-98,01-Aug-98,35,3,384,389,"Demand heterogeneity traditionally has been defined as segments of consumers that are homogeneous with regard to the benefits they seek or in their response to marketing programs (e.g., product offering, price discounts). Although it often is acknowledged that truly homogeneous segments of consumers do not exist, the approximation is assumed to be sufficiently accurate to provide a reasonable basis for the development of marketing strategy. In this article, the authors provide evidence that the homogeneous segment assumption might not be reasonable. By using a normal component mixture model that nests other, more commonly used models of heterogeneity, the authors find that the within-component heterogeneity remains substantial, even when multiple components are present. Predictive tests substantiate their finding of large within-component heterogeneity.","Greg M. Allenby, Neeraj Arora, James L. Ginter",,0

The authors use two different functions to relate consumption rates to household inventory and estimate the models using scanner panel data from two product categories: yogurt and ketchup. Both functions provide a significantly better fit than a conventional model, which assumes a constant daily usage rate. They also have strong discriminant validity; yogurt consumption is found to be much more flexible with respect to inventory than ketchup consumption is. The authors use a Monte Carlo simulation to decompose the long-term impact of promotion into brand switching and consumption effects and conclude with the implications of their findings for researchers and managers.","Kusum L.

The author develops two main results. First, when pulsing is optimal, the prevalence of advertising effects on switching or repurchasing affects the length of the pulse (shorter versus longer, respectively), as well as the optimal level of advertising. Second, the author identifies the functional forms of the short- and long-term effects of advertising in the discrete Markov process and shows that pulsing can be optimal if the transition probabilities are concave in advertising. As an alternative to a pure Markov carryover (if any), the author considers that carryover effects of advertising also might be caused by accumulation of memory for the advertisement. Although general results are difficult to obtain, the author analyzes one case of the compound dynamics of the Markov process and memory effects for advertising with results similar to the pure Markov process. Similarities and differences with continuous-time models, as well as managerial implications, are discussed.",Bart J. Bronnenberg,,0

Distance Representations of Consumer Perceptions: Evaluating Appropriateness by Using Diagnostics,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379803500201,01-May-98,01-May-98,35,2,137,153,"To understand consumer perceptions of product/market structures, marketers must choose from a wide variety of spatial and tree models. Because spatial and tree representations in general possess different distance patterns, diagnostic measures calculated from the input data of dissimilarities or similarities should be able to indicate how appropriate a certain type of representation might be for a given set of input data. In this article, the author draws from previous literature on the characteristics of diagnostic measures and representation models to develop some partial hypotheses about how well the measures might indicate the appropriateness (in terms of fit) of different models. Empirical analysis indicates that the skewness diagnostic is clearly the best predictor of the appropriateness of representation models; this finding is consistent across a variety of comparable spatial and tree models. Centrality and the reciprocity-related measure, in conjunction with skewness, are useful for specific types of space–tree pairs. The author uses the U-Method (closely related to jackknifing) of prediction, in conjunction with discriminant analysis models, to show that the diagnostics can predict the relative appropriateness of spaces versus trees with accuracy levels substantially greater than what would be expected by chance.",Sanjoy Ghose,,0
How Brand Names Affect the Demand for Twin Automobiles,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379803500202,01-May-98,01-May-98,35,2,154,165,"In this article, the author considers the effect of brand names on demand by examining the price ratios of used twin automobiles. Twins usually are made in the same plant and have essentially the same physical attributes but different brand names. If the models of a twin pair are perceived as perfect substitutes, their relative price should equal unity. Brand names could cause the demand for twin models to differ if consumers use the brand names to make inferences about unobservable quality. Consumers also might prefer one brand to another for prestige or status. The relative prices of most of the twin pairs in the sample differ from unity, which implies that consumers do not perceive the twin models to be perfect substitutes. Parent-brand quality and other brand factors are related to the relative prices of the twin pairs. The results suggest that consumers rely on information about the parent brand to make inferences about individual products that carry the parent name. The results have implications for firms’ branding policies.",Mary W. Sullivan,,3
Consumers’ Perceptions of the Assortment Offered in a Grocery Category: The Impact of Item Reduction,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379803500203,01-May-98,01-May-98,35,2,166,176,"Grocery retailers have been informed that, to remain competitive, they must reduce the number of stockkeeping units (SKUs) offered, in line with consumer demand, or, in other words, adopt “Efficient Assortment.” Retailers have resisted this principle on the basis of a fear that eliminating items would lower consumer assortment perceptions and decrease the likelihood of store choice. In two studies, the authors examine how consumers form assortment perceptions in the face of SKU reduction with a particular emphasis on two heuristic cues: the availability of a favorite product and the amount of shelf space devoted to the category. Results indicate that retailers might be able to make substantive reductions in the number of items carried without negatively affecting assortment perceptions and store choice, as long as only low-preference items are eliminated and category space is held constant. Thus, the potential risk inherent in item reduction might be more limited than initially thought. The authors then discuss the implications of these findings for retailers, as well as additional measurement considerations.","Susan M. Broniarczyk, Wayne D. Hoyer, Leigh McAlister",,0
Investigating Consumers’ Tendency to Combine Multiple Shopping Purposes and Destinations,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379803500204,01-May-98,01-May-98,35,2,177,188,"Because of the increasing time pressure they face, many consumers are becoming more concerned about the efficiency of their shopping patterns. Retailers have recognized this trend and have improved shopping convenience by offering greater variety in product categories and making it easier for consumers to combine visits to multiple stores. However, little is known about how consumers improve the efficiency of their shopping trips or how changes in retail supply affect the way in which consumers combine multiple purposes and destinations. Building on previous work in consumer shopping trip modeling and conjoint design theory, the authors introduce a choice-based conjoint approach to studying and modeling this phenomenon. The authors illustrate the approach in a case study that investigates the tendency of Dutch shoppers to combine grocery, drugstore, and clothing purchases across multiple shopping destinations. The authors observe that the tendency of consumers to combine purchases differs from category to category and depends on category availability. In general, consumers combine considerably fewer purchases than could be expected if their shopping trip planning was based purely on travel cost minimization.","Benedict G.C. Dellaert, Theo A.

Determining Segmentation in Sales Response across Consumer Purchase Behaviors,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379803500205,01-May-98,01-May-98,35,2,189,197,"The authors develop a joint estimation approach to segment households on the basis of their response to price and promotion in brand choice, purchase incidence, and purchase quantity decisions. The authors model brand choice (what to buy) by multinomial logit, incidence (whether to buy) by nested logit, and quantity (how much to buy) by poisson regression. Response segments are determined probabilistically using a latent mixture model. The approach simultaneously calibrates sales response on two dimensions: across segments and the three purchase behaviors. The procedure permits market-level sales elasticities to be decomposed by segment and purchase behavior (i.e., choice, incidence, and quantity). The authors apply the approach to scanner panel data for the yogurt category and find substantial differences across segments in the relative impact of the choice, incidence, and quantity decisions on overall sales response to price.","Randolph E.

Consequently, quantitative choice models incorporating simplification strategies recently have received much research attention. Given the additional computational cost and complexity involved in estimating these models, the authors investigate how robustly the standard logit model accommodates choice simplification processes. The results show that when consumers screen brands using an elimination-by-aspects strategy, logit forecasts choices reasonably well, but the parameter estimates are severely biased. However, when consumers screen through brands previously purchased, augmented by brands promoted, logit both forecasts poorly and produces biased parameter estimates, even when dedicated screening variables are included in the logit utility function. The predictive validity of logit improves somewhat when the universal set size is small and when purchase event feedback is less important.","Rick L. Andrews, Ajay K. Manrai",,0

The authors note that advertising has different goals, depending on the competitive context of the brand, with some advertisers positioned to differentiate between brands and others positioned to narrow the perceived difference between brands. The authors identify specific types of nonprice advertising positioning that increase brand equity and category price sensitivity, those that decrease both, and those that increase brand equity while increasing category price sensitivity. The hypotheses are tested in two experiments across different product categories. The results imply that tests of advertising effectiveness must extend beyond brand attitudinal measures.","Ajay Kalra, Ronald C. Goodstein",,3

Punitive actions are affected by interdependence, but a more complete picture is achieved by also examining punitive capability. The authors test hypotheses based on bilateral deterrence, conflict spiral, and relative power theories, but none of these comprehensively explains the effects of both total power and power asymmetry. Dealer punitive actions are inhibited as total interdependence increases, but are promoted as total punitive capability increases. Using spline regression, the authors find that interdependence asymmetry has no direct effect on punitive actions, whereas punitive capability asymmetry does. As dealers’ punitive capability advantage as compared with their suppliers’ increases, dealers make greater use of punitive actions, whereas they use fewer punitive actions as their punitive capability deficit increases. The authors also find that dealers with a relative advantage in dependence or punitive capability are more likely to reciprocate their supplier's punitive actions.","Nirmalya Kumar, Lisa K.

The authors develop a varying parameter model of purchase incidence and purchase quantity to ascertain whether this increase in promotions has affected households’ stockpiling decisions in the long term. The authors estimate the model on the basis of more than eight years of panel data for a frequently purchased, nonfood, consumer packaged-goods product. The results suggest that consumers’ stockpiling behavior has changed over the years. The increased long-term exposure of households to promotions has reduced their likelihood of making category purchases on subsequent shopping trips. However, when households do decide to buy, they tend to buy more of a good. Such behavior is indicative of an increasing tendency to “lie in wait” for especially good promotions. This change appears to have some deleterious ramifications for category profitability.","Carl F. Mela, Kamel Jedidi, Douglas Bowman",,0

Each studio wants to capture as much of the season as possible by opening early in the season. At the same time, each wants to avoid head-to-head competition. The authors model competition between two motion pictures in a share attraction framework and conduct an equilibrium analysis of the product introduction timing game in a finite season. The following three different equilibrium configurations emerge: (1) a single equilibrium with both movies opening simultaneously at the beginning of the season, (2) a single equilibrium with one movie opening at the beginning of the season and one delaying, and (3) dual equilibria, with either movie delaying opening. A key factor is the product life cycle, which can be captured well with a two-parameter exponential decline. The authors relate the life-cycle parameters to these possibilities with the general result that the weaker movie may be forced to delay opening. These results are related to case studies of the opening of recently released movies. A statistical analysis of the 1990 summer season in North America provides support for the conclusions and suggests that current release timing decisions can be improved. The authors discuss the rationale of “avoiding the competition” in the general context of product introduction timing.","Robert E. Krider, Charles B. Weinberg",,0
Estimating Irregular Pricing Effects: A Stochastic Spline Regression Approach,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379803500104,01-Feb-98,01-Feb-98,35,1,16,29,"Markets respond to prices in complex ways. Multiple factors such as price points, odd pricing, and just-noticeable differences often cause steps and spikes in response. The result is market response functions that are frequently nonmonotonic. However, existing regression-based approaches employ functions that are inherently monotonic, which thereby limits representation of important irregularities. In this article, the authors use a stochastic spline regression approach in the framework of a hierarchical Bayes model that permits the estimation of irregular pricing effects and apply the approach to data sets from several product categories. A simulation study indicates that the stochastic spline approach is flexible enough to accommodate irregular response functions. The empirical results show that there are irregularities in own-price response for most of the brands examined and that there are important profit implications of these irregular response functions in pricing decisions. The authors find that the irregularities in the response functions include sales increases associated with odd prices in the range of 12% to 76%, flatness at the extremes of the range of observed prices, and kinks in the response function that are consistent with segmentation effects.","Kirthi Kalyanam, Thomas S.

Investigating Purchase Timing Behavior in Two Related Product Categories,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379803500106,01-Feb-98,01-Feb-98,35,1,43,53,"The authors’ objective is to investigate the purchase timing behavior of households in two product categories for which the decision of a household to make a purchase in one category at a given point in time influences purchase in the other category. Interdependence in purchase timing between the two categories is modeled using a bivariate hazard function approach that accounts for unobserved heterogeneity. The authors provide empirical results from five durable and nondurable goods product category pairs—pasta and pasta sauce, liquid and powder detergents, clothes washers and dryers, soup and yogurt, and room air conditioners and dishwashers. The latter two categories are included in the analysis to ensure that the model can distinguish between true and spurious dependence caused by categories being purchased together. The authors find that the estimated cross-category correlation parameter obtained from the bivariate hazard model is consistent with prior expectations in each of the product categories. As in the literature on univariate hazard models, the authors find the bivariate hazard functions to be nonmonotonic in nature. Using the proposed model, the impact of price reductions in one category on the purchase probabilities in both categories is examined using the pasta/pasta sauce product pair. Given the positive relationship in the purchasing in these two categories, the authors find that a price cut in one category increases the purchase probabilities of both pasta and pasta sauce.","Pradeep K.

The mechanisms through which innovative late movers outsell pioneers are unclear. To identify these mechanisms, the authors develop a brand-level model in which brand sales are decomposed into trials and repeat purchases. The model captures diffusion and marketing mix effects on brand trials and includes the differential impacts of innovative and noninnovative competitors’ diffusion on these effects. The authors develop hypotheses on how the diffusion and marketing mix parameters of the brands differ by market entry strategy (pioneering, innovative late entry, and noninnovative late entry). The authors test these hypotheses using data from 13 brands in two pharmaceutical product categories. The results show that an innovative late mover can create a sustainable advantage by enjoying a higher market potential and a higher repeat purchase rate than either the pioneer or noninnovative late movers, growing faster than the pioneer, slowing the pioneer's diffusion, and reducing the pioneer's marketing spending effectiveness. Innovative late movers are advantaged asymmetrically in that their diffusion can hurt the sales of other brands, but their sales are not affected by competitors’ diffusion. In contrast, noninnovative late movers face smaller potential markets, lower repeat rates, and less marketing effectiveness compared with the pioneer.","Venkatesh Shankar, Gregory S.

Two field experiments and two lab studies show that anchor-based promotions—presented as multiple-unit prices, purchase quantity limits, and suggestive selling—can increase purchase quantities. The final study shows that consumers who retrieve internal anchors can counter these anchor-based promotions effectively. Firms might receive net benefits from anchor-based promotions depending on whether increases in unit sales reflect increased category consumption, brand switching, variety switching, store switching, or stockpiling.","Brian Wansink, Robert J.

The author performs a longitudinal quasi-experiment to investigate these issues using the introduction of the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act (NLEA) as a research context. Results indicate that information did promote consumer dynamics that may have fostered competitive activity among firms. Specifically, marketers changed the quality of base brands and their brand extensions in unique and opposite ways that enabled brands to occupy distinct strategic positions in the market. Market information also influenced the nature of competitive rivalry by shifting price promotion levels depending on the healthy positioning of firm brands. Such approaches were speculated to provide firms with a means of coping with the uncertainty of competitive and consumer reactions to the NLEA, extending theories of the market-level effects of information to include the strategic use of such information by firms.",Christine Moorman,,0
A Relationship between Market Share Elasticities and Brand Switching Probabilities,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379803500110,01-Feb-98,01-Feb-98,35,1,99,113,The authors derive a theoretical relationship between the aggregate market share elasticity matrix and the aggregate brand switching matrix on the basis of a logit model of heterogeneous consumers choosing among competing brands in a product class. Aggregate cross-elasticities are shown to be proportional (through a single scaling constant) to their corresponding aggregate row-conditional brand switching probabilities. Aggregate own-elasticities are shown to be proportional (through the negative of the same scaling constant) to one minus their corresponding aggregate row-conditional repeat purchase probabilities. An empirical analysis conducted on household scanner panel data in the liquid laundry detergent category shows that the theoretical correspondence holds as a very good approximation. An illustrative use of the relationship in estimating aggregate (store-level) models of market share indicates that the relationship helps improve predictive validity in a holdout period.,"Randolph E.

A Meta-Analysis of Relationships between Ad-Evoked Feelings and Advertising Responses,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379803500111,01-Feb-98,01-Feb-98,35,1,114,126,"The authors conduct meta-analyses of relationships involving positive and negative ad-evoked feelings to determine (1) whether the effects of positive and negative feelings on advertising responses are symmetrical or asymmetrical and bipolar or bidimensional; (2) whether study design characteristics influence the strength of effects of positive and negative feelings on ad and brand attitudes; (3) whether moderator effects are differential for positive and negative feelings; and (4) whether relationships are generalizable across different study designs, product types, and media. Using the aggregated data, the authors assess competing predictions of three alternative theoretical perspectives: bipolarity, generalized asymmetry, and contingent asymmetry. Analyses indicate that positive and negative feelings have contingently asymmetrical effects on advertising responses. Study conditions related to subjects’ cognitive processing sets moderated the effects of negative feelings on ad and brand attitudes but generally did not moderate the effects of positive feelings. The authors also demonstrate the utility of bootstrapping as an advantageous new way of conducting moderator analyses in meta-analysis.","Steven P. Brown, Pamela M. Homer, J. Jeffrey Inman",,0

Variations in these understandings—among knowledge communities as diverse as ethnographers, statisticians, historians, and even practitioners and researchers—yield a rich set of innovations in quantitative tools, experimental designs, data collection instruments, observational methods, sampling procedures, and interpretive frameworks. Research methods, however, must be consonant not only with the way various communities view scientific inquiry, but also with fundamental characteristics of the thought and behavior of customers and managers. Most widely used methods in marketing lack the latter consonance.

Interpreting Consumers: A Hermeneutical Framework for Deriving Marketing Insights from the Texts of Consumers’ Consumption Stories,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379703400403,01-Nov-97,01-Nov-97,34,4,438,455,"The author describes and illustrates a hermeneutically grounded interpretive framework for deriving marketing-relevant insights from the “texts” of consumer stories and gives an overview of the philosophical and theoretical foundations of this approach. Next, the author describes a hermeneutic framework for interpreting the stories consumers tell about their experiences of products, services, brand images, and shopping. An illustrative analysis demonstrates how this framework can be applied to generate three levels of interpretation: (1) discerning the key patterns of meanings expressed by a given consumer in the texts of his or her consumption stories, (2) identifying key patterns of meaning that emerge across the consumption stories expressed by different consumers, and (3) deriving broader conceptual and managerial implications from the analysis of consumer narratives. This hermeneutic approach is compared and contrasted to the means—end chains laddering framework, the “voice of the customer” approach to identifying consumer needs, and market-oriented ethnography. The author concludes with a discussion that highlights the types of marketing insights that can result from a hermeneutic interpretation of consumers’ consumption stories and then addresses the roles creativity and expertise play in this research orientation.",Craig J.

In these markets, consumers’ expectations about the future installed base and the resultant externality benefits play a critical role in their product adoption decisions. The authors investigate the strategic implications of consumer uncertainty regarding network externality and show that a firm can credibly convey private information about future installed base through its new product introduction strategy. The authors initially consider a market in which consumers are homogeneous in their valuation of quality. They show that under complete information the optimal strategy entails provision of full (efficient) quality in the first period itself, providing any upgrade in the second period is suboptimal. However, under asymmetric information about externality, a high-externality firm provides less than full quality initially and then makes up for the quality differential through provision of an upgrade in the second period. Thus, underprovision of introductory quality (i.e., withholding quality) serves as a signal of high externality, and upgrades serve as the mechanism for implementation of the signaling strategy. The authors demonstrate the robustness of this result by extending the model to incorporate consumer heterogeneity in quality valuation. The additional insight here is that signaling entails sequential targeting of segments in addition to sequential provision of quality.","V. Padmanabhan, Surendra Rajiv, Kannan Srinivasan",,0

Free-standing insert coupons are typically composed of two parts: the coupon per se and a print advertisement. Using two laboratory experiments and a separate analysis of coupon measurements from scanner panels, the authors investigate whether the content of the print advertisement influences the effectiveness of the coupon. Theoretical arguments suggest that the impact on consumer attitudes will depend on the executional cues of the copy, the brand loyalty of the consumers, and the consumer's involvement with the product category. The results support the theoretical framework and suggest that it is possible to make FSI coupons more effective by choosing appropriate executional cues for their advertising copy.","France Leclerc, John D.

Unfortunately, the majority of the commercial software programs available for performing such analyses (especially nonmetric analyses) suffer from serious limitations including degenerate solutions, interpretation difficulties, lack of supporting statistical inference and model selection procedures, excessive number of parameters to estimate, requirements of full data sets, and difficulties with local optima. The authors propose a new parametric approach to nonmetric unfolding (PARFOLD) to extend methodological developments in the econometrics and marketing science arenas. The authors develop the technical aspects of the proposed procedure, including options for accommodating incomplete rank orders, constraints, and reparameterizations. Two marketing-related applications are provided: one deals with preferences for snack food items involving complete rank orders, and the second involves incomplete data in which students rank order Master of Business Administration schools in their consideration/application sets. Comparisons are made with existing nonmetric MDU procedures including ALSCAL, PREFMAR and KYST with respect to several newly proposed diagnostic indices of solution degeneracy and positioning implications.

Although considerable attention has been paid in the couponing literature to the identification of factors that influence coupon usage behavior, relatively little work has been done to develop models that can help managers predict consumer response to specific coupons and design effective coupon promotions. The authors propose a model of coupon redemption that extends previous models of coupon usage by considering the joint effects of coupon attractiveness and coupon proneness on redemption, and does not require explicit measurement of these variables. Empirical application of the model shows that it correctly predicts redemption intentions for nearly 90% of consumers in a holdout sample and substantially outperforms a logit model that includes traditional measures of coupon proneness, coupon characteristics, and demographics. The proposed model also provides insights into consumer response to coupons that are not provided by the logit model. Overall, the model shows considerable promise as an aid to managers in designing coupon promotions and developing precision targeting strategies.","Kapil Bawa, Srini S. Srinivasan, Rajendra K.

These studies warn against using single-item measures of family members’ influence even in cases involving multiple respondents. In this study, using multiple-respondent, multiple-item data, the authors develop triadic measures of children's influence in four categories of product purchase decisions that exhibit desirable levels of convergent and discriminant validity. The process of measure development and validation demonstrates a methodology that combines the traditional measure purification process, confirmatory factor analysis, and multiple-influence, multiple-rater data analysis procedures.","Chankon Kim, Hanjoon Lee",,0

The magnitude of this difference renders market-level data largely unsuitable for econometric modeling, unless the marketing manager compensates for the bias that results from the incompatible aggregation. The authors introduce a new approach, a relatively simple debiasing procedure derived from simulated data. They show that this debiasing approach results in substantially improved parameter estimates. They illustrate the value of the procedure by applying it to scanner data for powdered detergents and comparing the debiased parameter estimates to results obtained from store-level data and an alternative aggregation method that maintains homogeneity for selected promotional activities.","Markus Christen, Sachin Gupta, John C.

Results of a study show that the decompositional question makes the process of eliciting frequencies less effortful and enhances the accuracy of the elicited frequencies for frequent, irregular behaviors (i.e., occurring at sporadic intervals), but not for frequent, regular behaviors. Mediational analyses confirm that these effects manifest because the decompositional question triggers an episodic recall strategy, which enhances the efficiency of the judgment formulation process for irregular behaviors but interferes with the normal process for regular behaviors.",Geeta Menon,,3

In this research, the author develops a theoretical framework of the brand personality construct by determining the number and nature of dimensions of brand personality (Sincerity, Excitement, Competence, Sophistication, and Ruggedness). To measure the five brand personality dimensions, a reliable, valid, and generalizable measurement scale is created.

The authors develop two formal models to study the effects of advertising “spillovers,” differentiation across competing retailers, and differentiation across competing manufacturers on the participation rate. The models show that more generous participation rates are called for with less targetable media, less differentiated retailers, more differentiated brands, and more upscale products within a category.

These techniques can be extremely sensitive to the presence of outliers, which might result in misinterpretations of the segments, and subsequently to inferring incorrect relationships of segments to independently defined, actionable variables. The authors propose a general approach to market segmentation based on the concept of overlapping clusters (Shepard and Arabie 1979), wherein each pattern of overlap can be interpreted as a distinct partition. Both K-means and K-medians clustering procedures are special cases of the proposed approach. The suggested procedure can handle relatively large data sets (e.g., 2000 entities), is easily programmable, and hence can be gainfully employed in marketing research.","Anil Chaturvedi, J.

Consistent with the industry practice, managerial input of advertising for the model is gross rating points (GRP) for each “daypart” and week. Exposures of each household within each daypart during each week follow a Poisson process with a distinct rate, which is inferred from the household's past exposure history after accounting for the advertising intensity. Because exposure pattern is computed at the household-level, the model accounts for audience accumulation of dayparts combination, which has a considerable managerial importance in media planning. The model is shown to fit the observed exposure pattern well at both disaggregate and aggregate levels. Applications illustrate the effect of changing the level of GRP on reach and frequency and advertising efficacy of different day-parts. The author implements reallocation of the current level of GRP among dayparts using the “greedy algorithm” to improve reach.",Makoto Abe,,0

In particular, “comparable” attributes, which produce precise and easy-to-compute comparisons (e.g., price), tend to be relatively more important in comparison-based tasks. Conversely, “enriched” attributes (e.g., brand name), which are more difficult to compare but are often more meaningful and informative when evaluated on their own, tend to receive relatively greater weight when preferences are formed on the basis of separate evaluations of individual options. Consistent with this analysis, systematic preference reversals were observed in a series of studies, which tested the proposed explanation on the basis of attribute-task compatibility, demonstrated that the findings generalize across preference elicitation tasks and attributes that have the characteristics prescribed by their theory, and examined rival accounts. The authors discuss the theoretical implications of this research and explore its consequences for the measurement of buyers’ preferences and for marketers’ pricing, merchandising, distribution, and communications strategies.","Stephen M.

The results of Study 1 indicate that consumers’ global assessments of extended affective episodes elicited by advertisements are dominated by the peak emotional experience and the final moment of the series and also are correlated with the pace at which momentary affective reactions improve over time. Ad duration is related only weakly to overall ad judgments, though longer advertisements have an advantage as long as they build toward a peak emotional experience. In Study 2, the authors replicate these findings under more realistic viewing conditions and demonstrate that the results cannot be attributed solely to memory artifacts that are based on recency. Study 3 implicates adaptation as a possible explanation for the preference for delayed peaks and high ends and further explains the weak effects of ad duration by showing experimentally that longer advertisements can both enhance and depress ad judgments depending on how duration affects the peak emotional experience and the final moment.","Hans Baumgartner, Mita Sujan, Dan Padgett",,0

To explain this counter-intuitive finding, the authors propose a conceptual framework that focuses on initial problem structure as a key moderator of the effect of expertise on performance. Specifically, they argue that the expert–novice performance differential should be greatest at moderate levels of problem structure and weakest at both extremes. To examine this central hypothesis, the authors conduct a controlled experiment that compares experts with novices when solving a complex problem that had characteristics of a moderately ill-structured problem. Relative to novices, the authors find that experts select fewer, but more diagnostic, information inputs and are more consistent when evaluating nonquantified inputs. As a result, they make more accurate and tightly clustered judgments than do novices, and also are more confident in their decisions. To examine the moderating influence of problem characteristics, certain task variables are manipulated to increase or decrease initial problem structure. As hypothesized, the benefits of expertise are less pronounced when solving a problem with increased initial structure.","Mark T. Spence, Merrie Brucks",,0

Using these results, the authors draw implications for manufacturers’ pricing, advertising, and promotion policies. The authors use a two-stage approach, which permits them to assess the medium-term (quarterly) effects of advertising and promotion as well as their long-term (i.e., over an infinite horizon) effects.

However, in industries facing rapid technological change, stiff competition, and uncertain customer needs, specifications set too early could become outdated by the time of market launch, thereby decreasing the product's benefits to the customer. The authors discuss an alternative approach, in which a firm delays commitment to product specifications and finalizes them just in time for the market launch after careful deliberation, thereby benefiting from the evolution of core technologies and customer preferences. Because such an approach introduces new managerial challenges, it would be appropriate only under certain circumstances. The authors develop a simple model of the product definition process that offers insights about how a firm should customize the process to suit its needs. They capture these insights as a managerial framework and illustrate them with industry examples involving the development process for laser printers and network test kits.","G. Kalyanaram, V.

Surprising Robustness of the Self-Explicated Approach to Customer Preference Structure Measurement,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379703400208,01-May-97,01-May-97,34,2,286,291,"The authors introduce customized conjoint analysis, which combines self-explicated preference structure measurement with full-profile conjoint analysis. The more important attributes for each respondent are identified first using the self-explicated approach. Full-profile conjoint analysis customized to the respondent's most important attributes then is administered. The conjoint utility function on the limited set of attributes then is combined with the self-explicated utility function on the full set of attributes. Surprisingly, the authors find that the self-explicated approach by itself yields a slightly (but not statistically significantly) higher predictive validity than does the combined approach.","V.

Using data from two industries (automobile and computer) and four countries (Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United States), they find that faster cycle time alone is not associated with higher accounting returns, sales growth, or perceived overall performance. Stronger support is found for the hypothesis that some product development practices, such as cross-functional teams and advanced design tools, interact with accelerated product development to improve performance, whereas other practices, such as reverse engineering of competitors’ products, suppress the potential benefits from lower cycle times. Finally, interaction effects for other organizational practices, such as customer involvement in the product development process and the extent to which new technology is obtained from external sources, appear to vary by industry.","Christopher D.

The research quantifies how product development cycle times increase with increased product complexity and with product newness, how using a cross-functional team interacts with product newness in the way it acts to reduce cycle time, and how using a formal product development process interacts with product complexity in the way it acts to decrease cycle time. The findings suggest that using cross-functional teams is more important in projects in which less of the design is a carryover from a previous generation. Teams then had a large impact in reducing product development cycle times. In contrast, implementing a well thought-out process is more important in firms (or divisions of firms) developing complex products or services.

The authors systematically examine the leads and lags at critical stages of the product development process: concept generation, prototype completion, and volume production. Their main finding is that lead-time advantage affects market share positively, albeit differentially, at each stage. The benefit of lead-time gain is greatest at the volume production stage, followed by the concept generation stage. The authors also develop a new notion of lead-time threshold—a time period in which if a competitor catches up, no market share gain is achieved by the firm that introduces the product first. They endogenously estimate the magnitude of the threshold for each stage of the product development process, observing that a significant threshold is present at both the concept generation and volume production stages. Finally, the structure of the development process, which differs across the firms in the market, affords significant differential ability to catch up with competitors.","Srikant Datar, C.

(2) What should its performance level be? and (3) How do the decisions of a competing firm affect a firm's timing and product performance decisions? The authors present a detailed case study of the initial competitors in the personal digital assistant (PDA) industry on the basis of which they construct a stylized game-theoretic model of entry timing and product performance level decisions in a duopoly. Situations in which the duopolists are symmetric as well as asymmetric in terms of their estimates of market size and product development capabilities are considered. When firms are symmetric, the authors show that an equilibrium exists when the firms enter at different times with different performance levels. In the asymmetric cases, the firm that has a higher estimate of market size enters first, as does the firm with a superior development process. The performance level decisions, however, depend on the sensitivity of demand to this variable. The results provide one explanation for empirical observations that market pioneers maintain their leadership in some cases, and later entrants eventually dominate in other cases. The authors then relate the model results to actual decisions in the PDA market, finding that Apple's Newton was “too little, too early.”","Barry L. Bayus, Sanjay Jain, Ambar G. Rao",,0

The results provide evidence for best practices as follows: (1) A firm wishing to develop an innovation superior to the competition must have a strong technological orientation; (2) a competitive orientation in high-growth markets is useful because it enables firms to develop innovations with lower costs, which is a critical element of success; (3) firms should be consumer- and technology-oriented in markets in which demand is relatively uncertain—together, these orientations lead to products that perform better, and the firm will be able to market innovations better, thereby achieving a superior level of performance; and (4) a competitive orientation is useful to market innovations when demand is not too uncertain but should be de-emphasized in highly uncertain markets.","Hubert Gatignon, Jean-Marc Xuereb",,0

Data from 92 new product development projects indicate that higher organizational memory levels enhance the short-term financial performance of new products, whereas greater memory dispersion increases both the performance and creativity of new products. They also find, however, that under some conditions of high environmental turbulence, high memory dispersion actually detracts from creativity and has no effect on financial performance. Under conditions of low turbulence, high memory dispersion promotes higher levels of creativity and short-term financial performance. These findings provide some initial evidence that knowledge is not an unconditionally positive asset and suggest that developing and sustaining valuable organizational memory may require attention not only to the appropriate levels of memory but also to managing subtle aspects of memory dispersion and deployment. These results imply that if organizations fail to understand the subtle ways in which different features of organizational memory influence product development, they may fail to harvest the full value of organizational learning.","Christine Moorman, Anne S.

It also provides shipment forecasts at various stages of the NPD process and thus can be used at new product project review gates to evaluate line extension concepts systematically. Finally, the system also can be used to improve the practice of the NPD process by enabling its users to take a product line perspective, using incremental sales evaluation, and by facilitating cross-functional and inter-project learning.

Some New Methods for an Old Problem: Modeling Preference Changes and Competitive Market Structures in Pretest Market Data,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379703400111,01-Feb-97,01-Feb-97,34,1,130,142,"Despite the enormous amounts of resources devoted to concept and product testing and the continued use of pretest market (PTM) modeling procedures, estimates of new product failures are still alarmingly high. The primary objectives of PTM modeling are to forecast the market share/sales volume of a new product and to determine the sources of new product share at the aggregate market level. The authors describe a new approach that is designed to provide a parsimonious description of competitive changes before and after a new product is introduced by identifying latent segments (i.e., groups of consumers) that vary in size and composition with respect to the relative preferences for a set of brands before and after a new product is introduced. Each latent segment represents a particular preference state characterized by a set of segment-level choice probabilities. The modeling framework is based on a class of dynamic latent class models that explicitly recognize two major types of preference heterogeneity: (1) heterogeneity caused by before-after changes in latent preferences for the brands (i.e., time-varying relative choice probabilities) and/or (2) heterogeneity caused by consumers changing their latent preference segment in response to a new product (i.e., time varying latent segment probabilities). As is demonstrated in the empirical application, the dynamic latent class models provide a comprehensive framework for understanding how a new product changes the competitive landscape.","Ulf Böckenholt, William R.

Although the correlations between attribute-based predictions, on the one hand, and customer acceptance and product costs, on the other hand, are significant and substantial, too much variance is left unexplained to rely on these models in isolation. This implies that more detailed design work should be performed on several concepts in parallel.

The authors investigate this issue with controlled experiments, using senior level executives as subjects. Their results suggest a strong bias toward continued commitment to failing new products. Consequently, the authors devise and test the effectiveness of five decision aids aimed at reducing this bias. Improving the quality of the information environment does not greatly reduce bias, nor does precommitment (at time of launch) to self-specified decisions rules. The most effective methods of reducing commitment to a losing course of action appear to be either precommitment to a predetermined decision rule or introduction of a new decision maker at the time of the stop/no stop decision. Of these two methods, the latter produces marginally less commitment to a losing course of action. However, none of the tested decision procedures completely reduces commitment to a losing course of action relative to the control condition.","William Boulding, Ruskin Morgan, Richard Staelin",,0

Substantively, however, the average estimated price elasticities are close for the household and store data analyzed, if the household data are selected on the basis of purchase selection.

These advertisements were presented in the context of advertisements for competing brands of cameras or for products in categories unrelated to cameras. When the context was composed of competing cameras, the attribute-focused advertisement resulted in more favorable target camera judgments than did the image-focused advertisement, whereas when products unrelated to cameras served as the context, the image-focused advertisement prompted more favorable judgments.

Although previous research has shown that different mechanisms can be used, the tendency has been to examine individual mechanisms in isolation. The authors develop hypotheses about interdependences between different control mechanisms. They also identify some of the contextual factors that influence their use. The framework is tested empirically by examining how chemical manufacturers organize their supplier relationships.

They discuss how a set of discrete attributes (e.g., brand name, package size, type) can be used to characterize a large set of SKUs in a parsimonious manner. They postulate that consumers do not form preferences for each individual SKU, per se, but instead evaluate the underlying attributes that describe each item. The model is shown to be substantially superior to a more traditional framework that does not emphasize the complete use of SKU attribute information.

In composite brand extension, a combination of two existing brand names in different positions as header and modifier is used as the brand name for a new product (e.g., Slim-Fast chocolate cakemix by Godiva). The results of both studies reveal that by combining two brands with complementary attribute levels, a composite brand extension appears to have a better attribute profile than a direct extension of the header brand (Study 1) and has a better attribute profile when it consists of two complementary brands than when it consists of two highly favorable but not complementary brands (Study 2). The improved attribute profile seems to enhance a composite's effectiveness in influencing consumer choice and preference (Study 2). In addition, the positions of the constituent brand names in the composite brand name are found to be important in the formation of the composite's attribute profile and its feedback effects on the constituent brands.

The internal supplier receives a larger bonus for a higher evaluation. The authors examine two internal customer-internal supplier incentive systems. In one system, the internal customer provides the evaluation implicitly by selecting the percentage of its bonus that is based on market outcomes (e.g., a combination of net sales and customer satisfaction if these measures can be tied to incremental profits). The internal supplier's reward is based on the percentage that the internal customer chooses. In the second system, the internal customer selects target market outcomes, and the internal supplier is rewarded on the basis of the target. In each incentive system, some risk is transferred from the firm to the employees, and the firm must pay for this; but in return, the firm need not observe either the internal supplier's or the internal customer's actions. The incentive systems are robust even if the firm guesses wrongly about what employees perceive as costly and about how employee actions affect profit.

Second, they hypothesize variety-seeking behavior to be a function of the individual difference characteristic of need for variety and product category–level characteristics that interact to determine the situations in which variety seeking is more likely to occur relative to repeat purchasing and derived varied behavior. The authors test their hypotheses in a field study of Dutch consumers, which assesses both the intensity of brand switching and the underlying motives for their switching behavior. Results support the importance of isolating variety switches from derived switches and of considering product category–level factors as an explanation for the occurrence of variety-seeking behavior.","Hans C.

Building Market Structures from Consumer Preferences,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379603300304,01-Aug-96,01-Aug-96,33,3,293,306,"The authors present a model that maps competitive market structures by identifying the preference structure of each consumer segment. By marrying two different data types—switching probabilities and attribute ratings—their model divides a market into several homogeneous sub-markets in which consumers consider a distinctive subset of brands (consideration set or competitive group) with a segment-specific rule for attribute evaluations and a segment-specific ideal point. Using data published in Harshman and colleagues’ (1982) work, the authors examine the U. S. car market and find brand-loyal segments for all car types except those favored by first-time buyers, a universal market, and five switching segments that consider car groups differing in the nation of origin, size, and luxury level. Breaking the switching segment into finer partitions gives a better account of the data than the Colombo-Morrison model or an asymmetric generalization of that model. The authors advocate the development of marketing goals with respect to each of the segment maps in the hope that it will lead to more synergistic marketing strategies for brands encountering multifaceted competition.","Lee G.

The Importance of Utility Balance in Efficient Choice Designs,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379603300305,01-Aug-96,01-Aug-96,33,3,307,317,"Choice designs traditionally have been built under the assumption that all coefficients are zero. The authors show that if there are reasonable nonzero priors for expected coefficients, then these can be used to generate more statistically efficient choice designs, because the alternatives in their choice sets are balanced in utility—they have more similar choice probabilities. The authors demonstrate that the appropriate measure of choice design efficiency requires probability centering and weighting of the rows of the design matrix, and they illustrate how this criterion enables the analyst to appropriately trade off utility balance against three other principles: orthogonality, level balance, and minimal overlap. Two methods, swapping and relabeling attribute levels, provide complementary ways to increase the utility balance of choice designs. The authors apply a process for generating utility-balanced designs to five different choice designs and show that it reduces by 10–50% the number of respondents needed to achieve a specific error level around the parameters. A sensitivity analysis reveals that these gains are diminished, but still substantial, despite strong misspecifications of prior parameter estimates.","Joel Huber, Klaus Zwerina",,3

They report two experiments that test conditioning procedures for prompting inferential beliefs, versus transferring affect, as means to influencing brand attitudes. Both studies use an established empirical paradigm for shaping brand attitudes with pictures or visual images as the unconditioned stimuli. The results indicate that brand attitudes can be conditioned using both attractive images that promote direct affect transfer and descriptive visual images that promote inferential belief formation. These data suggest that conditioning procedures can produce multiple benefits when they are applied in selecting and arranging the nonverbal cues to be featured in an advertising campaign.","John Kim, Chris T.

The joint latent segmentation model explicitly considers potential interdependence between the bases at the segment level by specifying the joint distribution of latent classes over the two bases, while simultaneously extracting segments on each distinct basis. An EM algorithm is used to estimate the model parameters. The authors present an empirical application, using pick-any data collected by a regional bank on two popular, conceptually appealing, and interdependent bases for segmenting customers of financial services—benefits (i.e., desired financial goals) and product usage (of an array of banking services). A comparative evaluation of the approach on synthetic data demonstrates the ability of the modeling framework to detect and estimate the interdependence structure underlying the two segmentation bases and thereby provide more accurate segmentation than “traditional” (single-basis) latent segmentation methods.","Venkatram Ramaswamy, Rabikar Chatterjee, Steven H.

The empirical applications illustrate the serious bias that results from the assumption that the demographic variables are independent of each other. Overall, the Bayesian approach recovers the underlying joint distribution of the variables of interest well and is unique in its ability to provide a measure of uncertainty about the resulting estimates. Hypothesis testing and the construction of confidence intervals are illustrated in the context of a retail site location application.

The author substantiates such concerns: Subjects who saw comparative price claims mistakenly infered that the advertised brand was least expensive overall and made suboptimal choices, though they could have found the omitted prices. As predicted, subjects were most likely to overgeneralize the most reliable-looking and informative claim— the one that (1) named the targeted competitor and (2) specified the savings amount.

The authors propose a two-stage choice process in which the consumer first identifies a subset of brands within the universal set of brands called the choice set and then evaluates only those brands that are in the choice set relative to one another to select a single brand. The authors find that, consistent with reports of the extent of external price search of consumers, response to shelf price variations is limited to the brands in the choice set (local price response). Their results indicate that employing the assumption of global price response may lead to biased estimates of price elasticity and derived measures of clout and vulnerability. To enable a managerially meaningful and useful assessment of a brand's competitive clout and vulnerability, the authors provide a brand-level approach to integrate local price response into the derivation of these measures.","Bart J.

The findings reveal that marketing program creativity is a function of individual problem-solving inputs (e.g., knowledge of the marketing environment, diversity of experience, diversity of education), motivational factors (e.g., intrinsic motivation, risk taking), and situational factors (e.g., planning process formalization, interaction with others, time pressure).","Jonlee Andrews, Daniel C.

Empirical studies lead to the additional hypothesis that a competitor orientation is detrimental to performance. To examine these hypotheses, the authors conduct two studies. The first is a laboratory study in which 1016 subjects made pricing decisions. When information about the competitor's profits was provided, over 40% of the subjects were willing to sacrifice part of their company's profits to beat or harm the competitor. Such competitor-oriented behavior occurred across a variety of treatments. The second is a field study used to examine the performance over a half-century of 20 large U.S. firms with differing objectives.

The practicality of this approach is demonstrated by an application to UPC-level data (25 UPCs, seven marketing instruments, and 156 weeks). In this example, to aggregate UPCs within a manufacturer into brand units would distort the relations between the marketing instruments and market responses.

The authors call these variations branded variants and suggest that manufacturers offer branded variants for the benefit of their most direct customers—retailers. With branded variants, a consumer must remember, evaluate, and process a wider variety of product features to make comparisons across variants and retail outlets. The authors suggest that as branded variants increase, some consumers experience an increased cost of shopping for a branded product across retail stores. Consequently, fewer consumers shop across retail stores. This reduced shopping translates into reduced competition across retail stores, which encourages (1) more retailers to carry a branded product and (2) retailers to supply that branded product with more retail service support. The authors use data from three retailers across 14 product categories to demonstrate that a branded product with more variants often has greater retail availability and higher levels of retail service.","Mark Bergen, Shantanu Dutta, Steven M.

They estimate a random effects heteroskedastic covariance probit time-varying parameter model on household scanner panel data from the liquid detergent category.

Specifically, in six studies, they show that a new feature adds greater value and increases the choice share of a brand more when the brand (1) has relatively inferior existing features, (2) is associated with lower (perceived) quality, (3) has a higher price, and (4) is both high-priced and high-quality. The results also suggest that the addition of a new feature reduces buyers’ price sensitivity for low-quality, but not for high-quality, brands and that multiattribute diminishing sensitivity is a more important moderator of the effect of new features than performance uncertainty.

In addition, they find evidence of a mere formality effect; that is, intelligence received through formal channels appears to be used more than that obtained through informal channels. The authors also find that the frequency with which market intelligence is disseminated is related to interfunctional distance, joint customer visits, senders’ positional power, a receiver's organizational commitment, and trust in a sender. Additionally they find the formality of the dissemination process is shaped by interfunctional distance, receivers’ trust in senders, and structural flux. Interestingly, the effects of internal environmental volatility (i.e., structural flux) appear to be different from those of external environmental volatility (i.e., market dynamism). For example, structural flux is found to affect dissemination formality, but not frequency, whereas the opposite is true for market dynamism.","Elliot Maltz, Ajay K. Kohli",,0

Does it really benefit manufacturers to do this? How is the retail pricing of the category affected by the double-couponing policy? And, what happens to the competing retailer that does not double coupon? The authors provide answers to these questions. They use a game theoretic model to (1) study the effects of double couponing, (2) derive the equilibrium level of couponing by manufacturers, and (3) derive the double-couponing retailer's retail pricing of brands in the category, as well as the pricing of the competing retailer that does not follow the double-couponing policy.

If desired, dissimilarity data can be combined with preference data to produce jointly estimated product space maps.

Rather than utilizing a diffusion model specification based on word-of-mouth and social contagion effects, the present approach uses a growth model specification and delineates a general function of time to describe the distribution of adoption timing. Estimation and several validation exercises performed on a data set describing the diffusion of personal computers across a sample of over 3000 U.S. firms provide strong support for the superiority of the SPOT model over models derived from restricted conceptualizations of innovativeness. The empirical work, albeit modest, tests the impact of covariates, such as firm-size and decision-centralization, on the dimensions of innovativeness and sheds light on some inconsistent findings in the innovation adoption literature.

Previous research has suffered from using non-natural settings, verbal measures of affect, and unknown brands. The author's study avoids forced exposure, uses a real program in which real commercials for unknown and known brands were embedded, and interviews subjects after they have viewed all the commercials. Thus, it offers a more natural setting in which to examine whether previously established relations between affective reactions and Aad and attitude toward the brand (Ab) still hold. The author measures affective reactions through facial expressions, as well as classical verbal measures, and finds that the contribution of affective responses to Aad and Abp is evident for verbal, but not facial, measures of affect. The impact of affective responses varies in a theoretically predictable way across familiar and unfamiliar brands, with the latter being more influenced by verbal affective reactions generated by the advertisement.

An analysis of estimated choice sets across panelists reveals that market share does not “go hand-in-hand” with choice set share (the percentage of choice sets in which a brand is a member). Examining choice set membership patterns, such as the cooccurrence of brands in the same product line, also provides insight into sister-brand cannibalization.

When the probability to switch of intenders is larger (smaller) than that of nonintenders, the overall mean purchase intent overestimates (underestimates) the proportion of buyers. As special cases, the author derives upper and lower bounds on proportions of buyers from purchase intents data and shows the consistency of those bounds with observed behavior, except in predictable cases such as new products and business markets.

They analytically extend Lal's model to incorporate heterogeneity in monitoring costs among franchisees belonging to the same franchisor and find strong empirical support for the hypothesis that monitoring costs inversely affect monitoring frequency within a franchise system.","Deepak Agrawal, Rajiv Lal",,0
Analyzing Constant-Sum Multiple Criterion Data: A Segment-level Approach,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379503200209,01-May-95,01-May-95,32,2,222,232,"The authors propose a methodology for determining the segment-level impact of explanatory variables on multiple criterion measures obtained on a constant-sum scale. These explanatory variables could characterize different product, situation, or person related conditions that either occur naturally or are experimentally manipulated. Their proposed methodology simultaneously estimates market segment membership and multivariate segment-level parameters for each dependent criterion, using finite mixtures of conditional Dirichlet distributions. They conduct a modest Monte Carlo simulation analysis to investigate the performance of the proposed methodology. The authors also provide an empirical application to industrial buying decisions that examines the impact of the type of buying situation on multiple vendor selection criteria such as economic cost, functional performance, vendor cooperation, and vendor capability.","Wayne S.

Testing their hypotheses from the perspective of automobile dealers, the authors find strong evidence that vulnerable resellers’ perceptions of both distributive and procedural fairness enhance their relationship quality, although these effects are moderated by the level of outcomes and environmental uncertainty. Furthermore, procedural fairness has relatively stronger effects on relationship quality than distributive fairness, which is a somewhat surprising result from a managerial perspective. The constructs and relationships among the constructs demonstrate cross-national stability across the two countries in the sample, the United States and the Netherlands.","Nirmalya Kumar, Lisa K.

In the proposed procedure, response segmentation is analyzed separately for each brand instead of jointly across all brands. This yields a segmentation picture oriented toward the potential targeting objectives of the brand manager. Using the multinomial logit and probabilistic mixture models, the procedure first calibrates consumer response in the brand choice decision. Individual-level measures of response for a given marketing variable (e.g., price) are then computed, and brand-level segments are obtained by clustering brand-specific response. Using scanner panel data, the approach is applied to price response segmentation for brands that compete in the ground coffee category. The results illustrate a series of implications for brand strategy, particularly the potential for targeting marketing activity to different response segments.","Randolph E.

Capturing Geographically Localized Misspecification Error in Retail Store Choice Models,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379503200112,01-Feb-95,01-Feb-95,32,1,103,110,"No retail store choice model, no matter how many relevant variables it might include, can realistically expect to model all the variation in store choice. There are always some variables that are left out, because they are difficult to measure, they have not yet been conceptualized in theory, or their estimated parameter stability suffers when an excessive number of predictors are included. Because these omitted variables can be correlated with geographic location, model misspecification error may itself be correlated with location. Estimating the geographically localized misspecification errors therefore suggests itself as a method for estimating (and predicting) the effects of these omitted variables. The authors show that spatial nonstationarity of the model parameters may also be expressed as an instance of omitted variables and therefore be addressed using their method. They show, using both a simulation study and an empirical natural experiment, that estimating the geographically localized misspecification error can appreciably reduce prediction error, even when the predictor model is reasonably well specified.","Roland T.

In study 2, replicating the design of study 1, the author demonstrates that ads that have a positive impact on usage attitudes toward the target brand can have a corresponding negative impact on usage attitudes toward the comparison product.

First, an increasing power advantage did not result in the predicted greater use of threats and punishments, although demands and normative statements were more prevalent. Second, one side of the dyad decreased its use of rewards and the other increased its use of rewards, promises, and information persuasion. As predicted, an increasing power advantage (lower relative dependence) is associated with less favorable performance evaluations of exchange partners and less residual conflict.","Gregory T.

As a result, in the short run, the rental market does not compete with the dealer's market. However, if the renter eventually sells some of its used cars into the consumer market, then these sales can compete with the dealer's sales of new cars.

In general, results show that in the long measurement delay condition, the recall of message contents was significantly higher with the long lag than with the short lag.

From this general theory, hypotheses pertaining to the duration of the deliberation process are tested using new car purchase survey data.","William P. Putsis, Jr., Narasimhan Srinivasan",,0

The authors use the encoding variability hypothesis to develop two approaches to counter the detrimental effects of competitive advertising. In the first experiment, the use of varying ad executions is shown to help resist competitive advertising better than repeating the same executions. In the second experiment, changing the modality of target advertising to be different from the modality of competitive advertising is shown to reduce interference effects.","H.

Traditional wisdom assumes that coupon redemptions are greatest in the period immediately following the coupon drop and decline monotonically. Using regret theory, the authors predict that expiration dates induce a second mode in the redemption pattern just prior to the expiration date. They test this prediction by extending an existing coupon redemption model to incorporate an expiration effect and then estimating both the existing and the expiration models using weekly coupon redemption data for spaghetti sauce from A.C.

They suggest that own-price elasticity represents a measure of differentiation and examine the effects of marketing communication activities on own-price elasticities for a large number of consumer (durable and nondurable) businesses. They make a series of predictions about future differentiation outcomes based on the likely uniqueness of the communication message. The obtained results are compatible with their basic premise that, by providing unique and positive messages, a firm can insulate itself from future price competition, as witnessed by less negative future price elasticities. Conversely, results indicate that nonunique messages can decrease future differentiation, for example, price promotions for firms that price above the industry average lead to more negative future price elasticities.","William Boulding, Eunkyu Lee, Richard Staelin",,0

These results imply that the quality measure contains information, incremental to that reflected by current-term accounting measures, about future-term business performance. They suggest that managers should convey information to the stock market, such as the brand's quality image, useful in depicting the long-term prospects of the business. By doing so, the stock market will rely less on short-term measures of business performance, and managers will be freer to undertake strategies necessary for ensuring the long-term viability of their firms.","David A.

The experiment-based findings reveal a positive relationship between the number of products affiliated with a brand and consumers’ confidence in and favorability of their evaluations of extension quality.

The econometric model also captures the extent of cannibalization of parent brand sales that may have occurred due to the line extension's introduction. The authors also explore the role of a brand's symbolic value as a factor in line extension success. Results indicate that parent brand strength and its symbolic value, early entry timing, a firm's size, and distinctive marketing competencies, as well as the advertising support allocated to line extensions, contribute positively to the success of line extensions. Their findings suggest that, in this industry, cannibalization effects of line extension activity may have been limited and line extensions into earlier subcategories actually may have helped the parent brand. Even with cannibalization, the incremental sales generated by the extension seem to be reason enough to make a line extension strategy viable.","Srinivas K. Reddy, Susan L Holak, Subodh Bhat",,0

It measures brand equity as the difference between an individual consumer's overall brand preference and his or her brand preference on the basis of objectively measured product attribute levels. To understand the sources of brand equity, the approach divides brand equity into attribute-based and nonattribute-based components.

Reliability measurement of qualitative data is important to determine the stability and quality of the data obtained. The authors assume a decision theoretic loss function, formally model the loss to the researcher of using wrong judgments, and show how this produces a new, proportional reduction in loss (PRL) reliability measure that generalizes many existing quantitative and qualitative measures. Because the PRL measure is often cumbersome to compute directly, they provide reference tables that enable the researcher to apply their approach easily. They then use this new approach to explore several important practical issues in conducting marketing research with qualitative judgments. In particular, they address the issues of (1) how reliable qualitative data should be (extending directly from Nunnally's rule of thumb for Cronbach's alpha in quantitative measurement), (2) how many judges are necessary given a known proportion of agreement between judges, and (3) given a fixed number of judges, what proportion of agreement must be obtained to ensure adequate reliability.","Roland T.

Their findings indicate that the three estimation techniques perform about equally well. UAM also is compared with traditional compositional mapping. They find that UAM is superior on fit of the solution, interpretability, and sample reliability. UAM probably holds an edge with respect to data collection. Traditional compositional mapping is superior on ease of data analysis. No major difference was found on predictive validity and structural reliability.","Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp, Hans C.M.

The authors suggest that this benchmark could form an overly naive point of reference in assessing the fit of a choice model calibrated on scanner-panel data, or any repeated-measures analysis of choice. They propose that fairer benchmarks for discrete choice models in marketing should incorporate heterogeneity in consumer choice probabilities, evidence for which is by now well documented in the marketing literature. They use simulated data to compare the performance of parametric and nonparametric benchmark models, which allow for heterogeneity in consumer choice probabilities, with the performance of the aggregate share-based benchmark model, which assumes consumers are homogeneous in their choice probabilities. They also assess the performance of two previously published consumer behavior models against the proposed fairer benchmark models that allow for heterogeneity in consumer choice probabilities. They find that one provides a significantly better fit than their more conservative benchmark models and the other performs less favorably.","Manohar U. Kalwani, Robert J. Meyer, Donald G.

In addition, it has been found that buyers’ purchase behavior can be influenced not only by the current price of a product, but also by what prices they expect in the future. The author builds a purchase quantity model to contrast normative behavior of consumers who have knowledge of future price deals with that of those who do not. Implications from the model are derived concerning consumer deal response for the consumer's preferred and less preferred brands. These implications show that normative purchase behavior is very different between consumers with and without knowledge of future deals. The model implies that consumers with knowledge of future deals could be more likely to purchase on low-value deals and deals on less preferred brands compared with consumers without knowledge of future deals. Another implication of interest is that the relative quantity purchased by consumers who have deal knowledge compared with those who do not depends on the time pattern of deals. The implications are supported in a laboratory experiment. The author finds that actual behavior varies depending on deal knowledge and is quite consistent with model predictions.",Aradhna Krishna,,0

HII allows one to handle large numbers of attributes in conjoint tasks by designing subexperiments that include subsets of attributes. It assumes that individuals can use general attributes or decision constructs to summarize their impressions of these subsets, which could be clusters of detailed, managerially relevant attributes. The proposed extension involves the design of sub-experiments that include attributes plus summary evaluations of remaining constructs. Advantages are that subexperiments can be analyzed separately but also jointly to estimate one overall preference or choice model; a more flexible and easy task is obtained; and one can test the assumed hierarchical decision structure. The authors illustrate the approach with an application that models consumer choice of shopping center. In this application, results partially support the hierarchical structure and predictive validity. Finally, the authors discuss implications for further research.","Harmen Oppewal, Jordan J.

However, the extent of transfer of autobiographical affect to the brand depends on forging a link in the ad between the brand and the personal memory, as Study 1 demonstrates. Study 2 shows that when autobiographical memories are encouraged, brand evaluations are no different given strong versus weak product arguments, further evidence that brand evaluations are not based on an analysis of product claims when such memories are evoked. Study 2 also provides evidence for the dominance of affective inputs into brand judgments when both autobiographical affect and product arguments are relatively accessible from memory.","Mita Sujan, James R.

Equity Estimation and Assessing Market Response,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379303000404,01-Nov-93,01-Nov-93,30,4,437,451,"Equity estimation has been proposed as a possibly superior technique for estimating market response functions in the presence of high predictor-variable collinearity. The relative performance of equity, ridge, and ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators is examined using simulation experiments. In part, findings are consistent with prior research and indicate that, under certain conditions, equity outperforms OLS and ridge on a number of important criteria, and equity yields coefficient estimates that assign more equal explanatory weight to correlated predictor variables than does OLS or ridge. As collinearity increases, this tendency becomes very pronounced, to the point where equity yields estimated standardized coefficients more equal in magnitude irrespective of other conditions, such as true coefficient values and model explanatory power.",Albert R.

How Consumers Allocate Their Time When Searching for Information,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379303000405,01-Nov-93,01-Nov-93,30,4,452,466,"The authors assume consumers maximize value subject to a constraint on their time. The value of positive information is the increase in the expected utility of the consideration set; the value of negative information is the utility of choosing on the basis of the information versus the utility of a potentially erroneous decision without information. They examine four rules consumers use to select the order in which to visit sources. They use a multimedia computer laboratory, which allows consumers free choice among showroom visits, word-of-mouth interviews, magazine articles, and advertising for a new automobile. They estimate source value, compare predictions of time allocations to actual allocations, examine the impact of time constraints on the use of negative information, and calculate the relative performance of the source-order decision rules.

Markor: A Measure of Market Orientation,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379303000406,01-Nov-93,01-Nov-93,30,4,467,477,"In recent years, academic and practitioner interest has focused on market orientation and factors that engender this orientation in organizations. However, much less attention has been devoted to developing a valid measure of market orientation. Here we define market orientation as the organizationwide generation of market intelligence pertaining to current and future needs of customers, dissemination of intelligence horizontally and vertically within the organization, and organization-wide action or responsiveness to market intelligence. The authors describe a procedure to develop a measure of the construct. Key features of the research methodology include several rounds of pretesting, a single-informant assessment, and a multi-informant (both marketing and nonmarketing executives) replication and extension. The multi-informant results indicate that the proposed 20-item market orientation scale (MARKOR) may be best represented by a factor structure that consists of one general market orientation factor, one factor for intelligence generation, one factor for dissemination and responsiveness, one marketing informant factor, and one nonmarketing informant factor. Taking into account the informant factors, the subsequent validation tests are moderately supportive of the market orientation construct. The authors discuss methodological, substantive, and application directions for future research in light of these findings.","Ajay K. Kohli, Bernard J. Jaworski, Ajith Kumar",,7
Excess Behavioral Loyalty for High-Share Brands: Deviations from the Dirichlet Model for Repeat Purchasing,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379303000407,01-Nov-93,01-Nov-93,30,4,478,493,"Small market-share brands are known to suffer from two specific disadvantages compared with high-share brands: they tend to have fewer buyers than high-share brands, and they also tend to be bought less often (Ehrenberg, Goodhardt, and Barwise 1990). The authors consider a third important advantage for high-share brands: unusually high behavioral loyalty (e.g., degree of repeat purchasing). We show, across many product-markets in both Japan and the U.S., that high-share brands have significantly greater loyalty than the levels that would be expected on the basis of a popular consumer purchase model (the Dirichlet model). Several possible causes for this effect are examined, including four key assumptions that underlie the Dirichlet model. The most likely source appears to be the existence of distinct consumer segments, which may emerge through the distribution strategies pursued by both large brands and small retailers. The authors discuss other possible causes of this market-share premium as well as several of its managerial implications.","Peter S. Fader, David C. Schmittlein",,0

Their focus is on situations in which consumer decision making is on the basis of multiple criteria. For model development and empirical investigation they consider a season ticket bundle for a series of entertainment performances such as sports games and music/dance concerts. In this case, they assume consumer purchase decisions to be a function of two independent resource dimensions, namely, available time to attend performances and reservation price per performance. Using this information, the model suggests the optimal prices of the bundle and/or components (individual performances), and corresponding maximum profits under three alternative strategies: (a) pure components (each performance is priced and offered separately), (b) pure bundling (the performances are priced and offered only as a bundle), and (c) mixed bundling (both the bundle and the individual performances are priced and offered separately). They apply their model to price a planned series of music/dance performances. Results indicate that a mixed bundling strategy is more profitable than pure components or pure bundling strategies provided the relative prices of the bundle and components are carefully chosen. Limitations and possible extensions of the model are discussed.","R. Venkatesh, Vijay Mahajaim",,3

Drawing on both organizational contingency theory and individual behavioral decision research, the authors suggest that successful performance depends on the congruence between the level of marketplace turbulence and the information-processing style and associated decisions adopted. They focus by way of example on the decision processes embodied in formal planning procedures. Using the results from an experiment conducted with a strategic marketing simulation game, they show that “planning” leads both to an underweighting of the time-sensitivity of marketplace information and toward a bias in favor of certain marketing decisions over others—decisions that, in this case, result in inferior performance in turbulent markets when compared with that of decision makers not engaged in formal planning. They discuss the implications of the findings for managerial behavior in turbulent markets.","Rashi Glazer, Allen M. Weiss",,0

In particular, interest may focus on identifying the contributions of buyers segmented on the basis of their prior purchase history. When the distribution of the number of purchase occasions in a base period can be described by the negative binomial distribution (NBD), conditional trend analysis (CTA) is a simple and effective approach for identifying the sources of incremental sales during a test (promotional) period. As currently implemented, CTA assumes a stationary marketing environment. The authors propose an extension of CTA that explicitly incorporates varying marketing activities. They also show that the often observed underprediction of purchases in the test period by nonbuyers in the base period is a consequence of the skewness of the NBD and is not necessarily due to model misspecification.

This means that, for instance, parameters of two identical utility specifications estimated from different data sources with unequal variances will necessarily differ in magnitude, even if the true model parameters that generated the utilities are identical in both sets. Despite a growing number of papers that compare MNL coefficients, no examples of appropriate tests of the joint and separate hypotheses of scale and parameter equality in MNL models exist in the marketing literature. The purpose of this paper is to address the proper procedure for MNL parameter comparisons between different data sets and to propose a simple relative scaling test that can be implemented with standard MNL estimation software.

One explanation explored in this research is that the measures commonly used for assessing the persuasive impact of comparative advertising are limited in their ability to capture the unique effects that may arise from this type of advertising. Measures that capture relative impressions of the advertised and comparison brands are found to be far more sensitive in detecting persuasion effects of comparative advertising. Moreover, the appropriateness of different types of relative measures is shown to depend on the correspondence between the encoding frame adopted during ad processing and the measure's response frame.","Randall L.

The overall results were consistent across product classes studied, which included beer, cars, and TV sets.

Such perceptions of overall bundle savings may consist of two separate perceptions of savings, each with a different relative influence: (1) perceived savings on the individual items if purchased separately and (2) perceived additional savings on the bundle. Results of an experiment indicate that additional savings offered directly on the bundle have a greater relative impact on buyers’ perceptions of transaction value than savings offered on the bundle's individual items.

The proposed model provides a paramorphic representation of market structure, based on the notion that “structure” implies heterogeneity in preferences and/or response to marketing mix elements. It assumes that independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) holds within latent segments (i.e., segments are homogeneous) but allows for heterogeneity across segments. Estimates for segment characteristics (including size, brand preferences, and sensitivity to marketing mix variables) are obtained by applying the model to aggregated longitudinal panel data. Validation tests are conducted on both the aggregated and disaggregated panel data. Aggregate validation demonstrates that the model is superior to standard market share models in terms of calibration and predictive fit. Disaggregated validation demonstrates that the latent segments recovered by the model account for much of the variation across household purchase histories, even though these data were not utilized in the estimation.","Michael J.

In this paper, we use a so-called threshold-crossing model to discriminate between credit card holders and nonholders.

The results of a Monté Carlo simulation experiment reveal that, under a wide range of heteroscedastic conditions, HMLE is more efficient and powerful than OLS and achieves these performance advantages without inflating type I error. Further, the relative performance of HMLE increases as heteroscedasticity becomes more severe.

The Future of Research in Marketing: Marketing Science,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379303000101,01-Feb-93,01-Feb-93,30,1,1,6,"This February 1993 issue begins the 30th Anniversary volume of the Journal of Marketing Research. The academic marketing discipline, as reflected in the articles published in JMR, has certainly changed dramatically over this time period. To reflect on these changes and generate discussion about the future directions for marketing research, I have asked several marketing scholars to prepare guest editorials.
It is fitting that Frank Bass write the first of these guest editorials. Professor Bass is a former editor of the JMR and a recipient of the William O'Dell Award for the best paper published in JMR, the Paul D. Converse Award for outstanding contributions to marketing science and theory, and the Richard D. Irwin/American Marketing Association Distinguished Marketing Educator Award. In addition to his research published in the leading marketing and management science journals. Professor Bass has made significant contributions through his former doctoral students who are professors in leading management schools across the world.

A Dynamic Process Model of Service Quality: From Expectations to Behavioral Intentions,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379303000102,01-Feb-93,01-Feb-93,30,1,7,27,"Relying on a Bayesian-like framework, the authors develop a behavioral process model of perceived service quality. Perceptions of the dimensions of service quality are viewed to be a function of a customer's prior expectations of what will and what should transpire during a service encounter, as well as the customer's most recent contact with the service delivery system. These perceptions of quality dimensions form the basis for a person's overall quality perception, which in turn predicts the person's intended behaviors. The authors first test this model with data from a longitudinal laboratory experiment. Then they develop a method for estimating the model with one-time survey data, and reestimate the model using such data collected in a field study. Empirical findings from the two tests of the model indicate, among other things, that the two different types of expectations have opposing effects on perceptions of service quality and that service quality perceptions positively affect intended behaviors.","William Boulding, Ajay Kalra, Richard Staelin,...",,0
The Motivational Impact of Sales Quotas on Effort,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379303000103,01-Feb-93,01-Feb-93,30,1,28,41,"A conceptual framework is presented that resolves some of the conflicts and inconsistencies in the various paradigms pertaining to goal setting. Hypotheses about the impact of quota level, expectancy, and self-efficacy on motivation are developed and tested in a laboratory experiment in which the subjects assume the role of salespersons and negotiate with opponents whose roles are simulated by a custom-designed computer program. The results indicate that as quota level is increased, effort increases only up to a point, after which increases in the level of the quota may actually decrease effort. Additionally, the impact of increased quota levels is stronger for subjects who are high in self-efficacy than for subjects who are low in self-efficacy. Finally, information about the level of task difficulty also influences the motivation to expend effort at the task.",Jhinuk Chowdhury,,0
Capturing Individual Differences in Paired Comparisons: An Extended BTL Model Incorporating Descriptor Variables,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379303000104,01-Feb-93,01-Feb-93,30,1,42,51,"The method of paired comparisons addresses the problem of determining the scale values of a set of stimuli on a preference continuum that is not directly observable. The conventional approach in analyzing paired comparisons is to view all individuals as homogeneous and estimate a single vector of scale values for the stimuli. The authors describe an extended BTL model, a simultaneous segmentation and estimation procedure for paired comparisons that can also accommodate descriptor variables, if available. The procedure extends methods for analyzing paired comparisons in two important ways. First, recognizing that individuals may be heterogeneous in their preference structure, the model attempts to group individuals into segments, where individuals belonging to the same segment can be characterized adequately by a segment-specific set of scale values. Second, the model allows descriptor variables to be incorporated into the analysis. Though incorporating descriptor variables in the analysis of paired comparisons entails some additional estimation issues, the ability to calibrate stimulus scale values for different market segments and to understand the potential reasons why the relative locations of the stimuli as perceived by persons making the judgments vary according to the latent segment to which an individual belongs appears to be an extremely useful feature of the proposed method.","William R.

Specifically, she investigates the conditions under which respondents’ answers to a brand evaluation are likely to be consistent with a previous attribute rating (carryover effect) versus inconsistent (backfire effect).

First, the strength, valence, and consistency of pairwise relationships were assessed by means of a meta-analysis. Second, methodological characteristics coded as moderator variables were used to account for variability in study effects. Finally, weighted mean correlations resulting from the analysis of pairwise relationships were used to evaluate a causal model of antecedents and consequences of job satisfaction. In general, relationships involving job satisfaction were robust across study contexts. Systematic moderating effects of type of sales-force and operationalization of job satisfaction were found. Several summary conclusions about antecedents and consequences of salesperson job satisfaction are drawn from the analyses.","Steven P. Brown, Robert A. Peterson",,0

However, this recommendation is based on studies that have several weaknesses, including use of single exposure levels, established commercials, and learning as the primary dependent variable. The authors report the findings of a laboratory experiment in which they compared the effectiveness of :15s and :30s by using novel commercials with different message appeals (informational vs. emotional), exposing subjects multiple times, and employing multiple dependent variables. They find that informational :15s are as effective as informational :30s in several situations and can be used as stand-alone units. They also show that emotional :30s are superior to emotional :15s in influencing a viewer's learning of brand name and attitude.

The Effectiveness of Alternative Preference Elicitation Procedures in Predicting Choice,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379303000109,01-Feb-93,01-Feb-93,30,1,105,114,"In a large-scale national study, the authors evaluated the effectiveness of several preference elicitation techniques for predicting choices. The criteria for accuracy included both individual hit rates and a new measure, the mean absolute error predicting aggregate share using a logit choice simulator. The central finding is that hybrid models combining information from different preference elicitation tasks consistently outperform models based on one task. For example, ACA, a method that combines a self-explicated prior with relative preference measures on pairs, predicts choices better than full-profile conjoint when warmup tasks are lacking. However, there is no difference between the models if ACA's prior is combined with the full-profile information. Further, the most accurate method combines data from all three sources, suggesting that each preference elicitation technique taps a different aspect of the choice process in the validation task. Finally, full-profile conjoint is found to be significantly more accurate after rather than before, other preference elicitation tasks, implying that its performance can be improved with warmup exercises.","Joel Huber, Dick R.

Using Segmentation to Improve Sales Forecasts Based on Purchase Intent: Which “Intenders” Actually Buy?,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379202900401,01-Nov-92,01-Nov-92,29,4,391,405,"The authors investigate whether the use of segmentation can improve the accuracy of sales forecasts based on stated purchase intent. The common current practice is to prepare a sales forecast by using purchase intent and observed historical patterns in purchase rates given level of intent. The authors show that the accuracy of sales forecasts based on purchase intent can be improved by first using certain kinds of segmentation methods to segment the panel members. The main empirical finding is that more accurate sales forecasts appear to be obtained by applying statistical segmentation methods that distinguish between dependent and independent variables (e.g., CART, discriminant analysis) than by applying simpler direct clustering approaches (e.g., a priori segmentation or K-means clustering). The results further reveal that meaningful segments are present and identifiable that vary in their subsequent purchase rates for a given level of intent. This identification has important implications for areas such as target marketing, as it indicates which customer segments will actually fulfill their intentions. One key substantive finding is that households in a (demographic/product-usage-based) segment having an a priori high propensity to purchase are also more likely to fulfill a positive intention to purchase.","Vicki G.

Transitions in Preference over Time: The Effects of Memory on Message Persuasiveness,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379202900402,01-Nov-92,01-Nov-92,29,4,406,416,"In a mixed-choice situation, consumers must choose between brands that are directly observable and brands encountered previously. Prior research suggests a conservative bias to choose an observable brand if it is acceptable and if memory for the previously encountered brands is poor. The authors demonstrate in three experiments that this bias may be highly sensitive to stimulus factors. They replicate the bias when all brands have similar attribute structures. However, when the brands are less comparable, aspects of the previously encountered brands or their descriptions may interact with memory to eliminate or reverse the effect. Thus, over time, preference for a memory brand in relation to an observable brand may increase or decrease significantly, and may do so irrespective of the memory brand's true relative merits. Implications of these results for current models of persuasion are discussed.","Joseph W. Alba, Howard Marmorstein, Amitava Chattopadhyay",,0
Elimination by Dimensions,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379202900403,01-Nov-92,01-Nov-92,29,4,417,429,"The well-known PRETREE model, though rich in behavioral structural theory, is virtually unused by marketing practitioners. Four problem areas relating to the application of PRETREE are identified. The authors then develop the “elimination-by-dimensions” (EBD) model to address these problems. A key feature of the EBD model is the recognition that most real-life marketing attributes are continuous dimensions, not aspects. The EBD model provides diagnostic information by labeling the specific dimensions consumers use to eliminate alternatives hierarchically. A procedure for naming the key dimensions directly from the data is suggested. Empirical information from both an industrial buying dataset and a consumer product dataset is used to compare the predicted market share estimates of the EBD model with predictions based on Tversky and Sattath's suggested conditional probability approach and the multinomial logit model. The EBD model gives substantially better market share predictions on both datasets than the conditional probability approach. Finally, using only dimensions identified by the disaggregate EBD model, the authors show individual-level predictions to be significantly above the chance level.","Dennis H.

The Effect of the Focus of Comparison on Consumer Preferences,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379202900404,01-Nov-92,01-Nov-92,29,4,430,440,"The authors propose that the attractiveness and choice probability of an alternative can be enhanced by making it the focus of a comparison (the focal option) with a competing alternative. This proposition is supported in choice problems involving alternatives about which consumers have information in memory (e.g., frozen yogurt and fruit salad). The focal option was manipulated by asking respondents how much more or less attractive one of the two (e.g., fruit salad) was. When descriptions of alternatives’ features were provided rather than retrieved from memory, a manipulation of the focal option had a weaker and less consistent effect on preferences. Think-aloud protocols were used to gain insights into the effect of changing the focal option on decision processes. The implications of the results for marketers’ communications strategies are discussed.","Ravi Dhar, Itamar Simonson",,0

Findings about the effectiveness of such ads have been inconclusive, however, perhaps because a critical moderator has been ignored. The author found that a two-sided ad was more effective than one-sided ads only when negatively correlated (vs. uncorrelated) attributes were featured. The brand's unfavorable positioning on the negatively correlated secondary attribute per se (i.e., “correlational inferences”), as well as the advertiser's honesty (i.e., “correspondent inferences”), jointly enhanced judgments of the brand on the primary attribute and thus overall brand evaluations.",Cornelia Pechmann,,3

The findings suggest that such camera angle effects are likely to emerge when viewers’ motivation to process ad information is either low or moderate rather than high. When processing motivation was low, evaluations were most favorable when the viewer seemed to be looking up at the product, least favorable when he or she looked down at the product, and moderate when the product was at eye level. However, when processing motivation was moderate, eye-level shots produced the most favorable evaluations. The authors suggest that the use of different processing heuristics may be responsible for these camera angle effects.","Joan Meyers-Levy, Laura A. Peracchio",,0

Two hypotheses about the effect of context on choice are proposed. The first hypothesis, tradeoff contrast, states that the tendency to prefer an alternative is enhanced or hindered depending on whether the tradeoffs within the set under consideration are favorable or unfavorable to that option. The second hypothesis, extremeness aversion, states that the attractiveness of an option is enhanced if it is an intermediate option in the choice set and is diminished if it is an extreme option. These hypotheses can explain previous findings (e.g., attraction and compromise effects) and predict some new effects, demonstrated in a series of studies with consumer products as choice alternatives.

The Effects of Brand Extensions on Market Share and Advertising Efficiency,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379202900302,01-Aug-92,01-Aug-92,29,3,296,313,"The authors examine the effects of brand strategy (i.e., brand extensions vs. individual brands) on new product market share and advertising efficiency, and the degree to which these effects are moderated by characteristics of the brand, the product to which it is extended, and the market in which that product competes. The findings indicate that brand extensions capture greater market share and realize greater advertising efficiency than individual brands. The strength of the parent brand is related positively to the market share of brand extensions but has no effect on advertising efficiency. Neither the market share nor the advertising efficiency of extensions is affected by the number of products affiliated with the parent brand. The relative effect of brand extensions on market share is not moderated by the degree of similarity between the extension and other products affiliated with the brand. Advertising efficiency effects, however, are elevated when similarity is high, but only when it is based on intrinsic attributes. Market share and advertising efficiency effects are elevated when the extension is composed primarily of experience attributes and competes in markets where consumers have limited knowledge of the product class. Competitive intensity does not moderate advertising efficiency effects; however, market share effects are elevated when the extension competes in markets comprising few competitors. Finally, both market share and efficiency effects diminish as the extension becomes established in the market.","Daniel C. Smith, C. Whan Park",,0

The relationships were tested in a sample of 779 users and providers of market research information. Results indicate that trust and perceived quality of interaction contribute most significantly to research utilization, with trust having indirect effects through other relationship processes, as opposed to important direct effects on research utilization. Deeper levels of exchange, including researcher involvement in the research process and user commitment to the research relationship, however, have little effect on research use. Finally, the relationships in the model show few differences depending on whether the producer and user share marketing or research orientations.

Specifically, the effects of evaluative feedback, counterfactual reasoning, and expertise are explored in two experiments in the context of making strategic marketing predictions. The findings provide some novel insights on overconfidence and accuracy of predictions. They suggest that (1) “humbling” feedback increases accuracy and lowers overconfidence, (2) overconfidence from being “blind sided” can be reduced by counterfactual reasoning, and (3) “richness” of experts’ mental representations results in higher overconfidence.

Two longitudinal experiments were conducted to investigate judgmental mechanisms that contribute to this advantage. In experiment 1, the amount of information presented was held constant across brands. Nevertheless, subjects learned more about the pioneer than about later entrants and consequently judgments of the pioneer were more extreme and were held with greater confidence. Furthermore, the pioneering advantage increased over time, especially when subjects were exposed repeatedly to the features of the pioneer. Experiment 2 demonstrated that order-of-entry effects on consumer memory and judgment are eliminated when information about a set of brands is presented simultaneously as opposed to sequentially. Furthermore, the results revealed that sequential information processing benefits the pioneer even when product information is processed incidentally.

Impact of Resource Allocation Rules on Marketing Investment-Level Decisions and Profitability,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379202900202,01-May-92,01-May-92,29,2,162,175,"In many organizations, marketing investment-level decisions precede the associated resource allocation decisions and are based on market-level sales response data, often with no attention to the impact of rules used to allocate resources to submarkets. Such top-down budgeting is commonly based on a perception that aggregate sales and profitability are affected much more by the level than by the allocation of the investment. The authors analyze the effects of different resource allocation rules assuming alternative specifications of submarket sales response functions and show that allocation decisions significantly influence aggregate sales response functions, investment-level decisions based on these functions, and realized profit. The authors also show aggregate sales and profit are usually more sensitive to improvements in allocation rules than to increases in investment levels and conclude that resource allocation decisions warrant more attention in marketing budgeting.","Murali K.

Improving Rating Scale Measures by Detecting and Correcting Bias Components in Some Response Styles,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379202900203,01-May-92,01-May-92,29,2,176,188,"The author examines whether the response styles of yeasaying and standard deviation in rating scale responses convey information on respondents’ attitudes or create bias that distorts attitude information and marketing research. A method is proposed to identify attitude information components and bias components in response styles, using prediction errors in attitude-behavior models. Analysis of data from a large-scale consumer survey supports the presence of both attitude information and bias components in standard deviation, and an attitude information but not a bias component in yeasaying. This finding suggests that correcting rating scale data by removing the bias but not the attitude information in standard deviation can increase the accuracy of survey research. Examples are given of how bias in standard deviation, and the scoring correction, affect segmentation research.",Eric A. Greenleaf,,0
A Communications Response Model for a Mature Industrial Product: Application and Implications,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379202900204,01-May-92,01-May-92,29,2,189,200,"The rising cost of an industrial sales call underscores the need for integration of personal selling with other modes of industrial communication, notably advertising, within the overall context of efficient resource deployment. The authors propose an approach to assess the joint impact of advertising and personal selling effort on sales of a mature industrial product and thereby to plan the overall communications budget and its split between advertising and personal selling. Through an empirical application, they demonstrate the estimation of a communications response model and its use as an input to the planning process. In the illustration, the model's recommendation calls for an increase in the total communications budget over the current level, as well as some reallocation among its elements, based on a multiperiod profit-maximizing objective. Finally, to obtain a more general understanding of communications budgeting under different market situations, the authors employ the model to investigate analytically the impact of key market factors on the optimal level and allocation of communications effort.","Srinath Gopalakrishna, Rabikar Chatterjee",,0
"Brand Choice, Purchase Incidence, and Segmentation: An Integrated Modeling Approach",https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379202900205,01-May-92,01-May-92,29,2,201,215,"The authors develop an approach to market segmentation based on consumer response to marketing variables in both brand choice and category purchase incidence. The approach reveals segmentation as well as the nature of choice and incidence response for each segment. Brand choice and purchase incidence decisions are modeled at the segment level with the disaggregate multinomial logit and nested logit models; segment sizes are estimated simultaneously with the choice and incidence probabilities. Households are assigned to segments by using their posterior probabilities of segment membership based on their purchase histories. The procedure thereby permits an analysis of the demographic, purchase behavior, and brand preference characteristics of each response segment. The authors illustrate their approach with scanner panel data on the liquid laundry detergent category and find segmentation in price and promotion sensitivity for both brand choice and category purchase incidence. The results suggest that many households that switch brands on the basis of price and promotion do not also accelerate their category purchases and that households that accelerate purchases do not necessarily switch brands.","Randolph E.

Children 4 to 12 years of age made choices from an initial and an expanded set of products using a modified constant sum allocation procedure.

Market Share Response When Consumers Seek Variety,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379202900207,01-May-92,01-May-92,29,2,227,237,"Using a model of consumer variety-seeking, the authors study the long-term market share implications of changes in variety-seeking intensity, brand preferences, and pairwise similarities between brands. Those analytically derived guidelines are examined in three-brand and five-brand markets through simulation. The least preferred brand is found generally to gain market share as variety-seeking intensifies whereas the most preferred brand tends to lose share. If two brands are perceived as having become more similar without a change in overall preferences, the repositioned brands are likely to lose market share while uninvolved brands gain share. If two brands are perceived as having become more similar in a way that increases overall preference for those repositioned brands, they should gain market share while uninvolved brands lose it. A behavioral experiment provides preliminary empirical support for some of the findings.","Fred M. Feinberg, Barbara E. Kahn, Leigh Mcalister",,0

A dyadic model represented by a simultaneous equation system is estimated with data from 378 pairs of manufacturers and industrial distributors. The results indicate that one type of pledge, idiosyncratic investments, has a strong effect on the commitment of both parties to the relationship. In addition, each party's commitment is affected by the perceived commitment of the other party.

The Effects of Sequential Introduction of Brand Extensions,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379202900104,01-Feb-92,01-Feb-92,29,1,35,50,"A laboratory experiment examines factors affecting evaluations of proposed extensions from a core brand that has or has not already been extended into other product categories. Specifically, the perceived quality of the core brand and the number, success, and similarity of intervening brand extensions, by influencing perceptions of company credibility and product fit, are hypothesized to affect evaluations of proposed new extensions, as well as evaluations of the core brand itself. The findings indicate that evaluations of a proposed extension when there were intervening extensions differed from evaluations when there were no intervening extensions only when there was a significant disparity between the perceived quality of the intervening extension (as judged by its success or failure) and the perceived quality of the core brand. A successful intervening extension increased evaluations of a proposed extension only for an average quality core brand; an unsuccessful intervening extension decreased evaluations of a proposed extension only for a high quality core brand. Though a successful intervening extension also increased evaluations of an average quality core brand, an unsuccessful intervening extension did not decrease core brand evaluations regardless of the quality level of the core brand. The relative similarity of intervening extensions had little differential impact, but multiple intervening extensions had some different effects than a single intervening extension.","Kevin Lane Keller, David A.

An Integrative Look at the Use of Additive and Multiplicative Covariance Structure Models in the Analysis of MTMM Data,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379202900105,01-Feb-92,01-Feb-92,29,1,51,64,"First-order confirmatory factor analytic models have had widespread use in the analysis of multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) data.

Two such models are Wothke's covariance component analysis model and Browne's direct product model. The authors provide a conceptual and analytic discussion of those alternative procedures and compare them with the conventional first-order confirmatory factor analytic model. They consider the relationship between method factors and trait factors assumed under each model specification. General remarks about the nature of method factors and the likely reasons for lack of fit and ill-defined solutions frequently encountered with use of first-order factor models are presented. The authors also attempt to integrate the various approaches to modeling MTMM data and in so doing provide some perspective on selection of a particular covariance structure model for use in applied research.","Ajith Kumar, William R.

Evaluating the Multiple Effects of Retail Promotions on Brand Loyal and Brand Switching Segments,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379202900107,01-Feb-92,01-Feb-92,29,1,76,89,"The authors determine the multiple effects of retail promotions on brand loyal and brand switching segments of consumers. Segments are determined by an iterative Bayesian procedure. The variations in within-segment brand shares within a store are related to promotional variables by a logit model estimated by nonlinear least squares. Store share is modeled as a function of store attractiveness, a summary measure of the store's promotional activity on the multiple brands. Finally, category volume is related to overall product category attractiveness in a model that includes both current and lagged effects. The research approach is applied to the IRI ground coffee data. Results include: (1) the market can be characterized by brand loyal segments, each of which buys mostly their favorite brand, and switching segments, each of which switches mainly among different brands of the same type (e.g., drip, percolator), (2) promotional variables have significant effects on within-segment market shares, the effects being different across segments, (3) store share is related significantly to promotional attractiveness of a store, (4) the overall promotional attractiveness of the product category has significant current and lagged effects on category volume, and (5) the lagged effects resulting from consumer purchase acceleration and stockup last longer for brand loyal segments than for switching segments.","Rajiv Grover, V.

Consumer Price and Promotion Expectations: An Experimental Study,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379202900108,01-Feb-92,01-Feb-92,29,1,90,100,"The authors report results from a controlled experiment designed to investigate the impact of a brand's price promotion frequency and the depth of promotional price discounts on the price consumers expect to pay for that brand. A key feature of the work is that expected prices elicited directly from respondents in the experiment are used in the analysis, as opposed to the latent or surrogate measures of expected prices used in previous studies. As hypothesized, both the promotion frequency and the depth of price discounts are found to have a significant impact on price expectations. Evidence also supports a region of relative price insensitivity around the expected price, such that only price changes outside that region have a significant impact on consumer brand choice. Further, the authors find that consumer expectations of both price and promotional activities should be considered in explaining consumer brand choice behavior. Specifically, the presence of a promotional deal when one is not expected or the absence of a promotional deal when one is expected may have a significant impact on consumer brand choice. Finally, as in the case of price expectations, consumer response to promotion expectations is found to be asymmetric in that losses loom larger than gains.","Manohar U. Kalwani, Chi Kin Yim",,0

Before performance outcomes are known, the target's satisfaction and trust are strongly affected by the type of influence exercised; more dominating influence types result in less positive attitude. When outcomes of compliance become evident, however, favorable outcomes appear to ameliorate negative attitudes, whereas unfavorable outcomes seem to undermine positive attitudes.

Promotion Has a Negative Effect on Brand Evaluations—Or Does It?

Though that hypothesis refers to a change in brand evaluation at the individual level, tests of it typically have been performed with repurchase probabilities at the aggregate level. Recent work by Neslin and Shoemaker shows that it is possible to observe a decrease in aggregate repurchase probability due to promotion even if individual-level repurchase probabilities are unchanged. Though their evidence does not directly test the hypothesis of a negative effect for promotion, it does provide an alternative explanation for observed results. The authors expand their work by directly testing the hypothesis of a negative effect for promotion and by performing that test on the underlying construct, brand evaluation. After initial measurement of shoppers’ evaluations, brands in test categories were promoted for three months. At the end of the promotion manipulation period, brand evaluations were remeasured. The hypothesis that overall evaluation of promoted brands would decrease is rejected.","Scott Davis, J. Jeffrey Inman, Leigh McAlister",,0

The authors also compare their results with those obtained from logit models in which observed past choice behavioir is used to capture such heterogeneity.

They develop a measurement method to test the model at the individual level and apply it to the ready-to-eat cereal market. The model is tested in two ways. First, the utility function is calibrated at the individual level and the model is used to predict consideration of existing brands. The calibrated model also is used to forecast individual consideration of three new product concepts. Second, the predictive ability of a two-stage model of consideration and choice is tested against a traditional one-stage choice model.

The author determines how consumer perceptions of deal frequency for a brand may be influenced by the dealing pattern of that brand and of other brands. She shows that the price consumers are willing to pay for a brand is correlated more highly with perceived deal frequency than with actual deal frequency.

Equilibrium Characteristics of Multinomial Logit Market Share Models,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379102800410,01-Nov-91,01-Nov-91,28,4,480,482,"Previous research suggests that a multinomial logit model of market share can be used in optimization or equilibrium analyses of marketing decision making. However, there are significant problems with the solutions obtained from such an analysis. The authors show that for any firm with less than a 50% market share, the profit maximizing solution is to increase advertising as much as possible. The same holds true for any other positively signed marketing mix variable. The exponential property of the MNL model precludes reasonable descriptions of firm behavior in this case. Thus, the MNL market share model is inappropriate for equilibrium analysis of marketing competition.","Thomas S. Gruca, D. Sudharshan",,0

They demonstrate that the actual estimation procedure used by Shugan has several methodological problems and may yield unstable estimates. They propose an alternative estimation procedure, full-information maximum likelihood (FIML), which addresses the problems and yields significantly improved results. An important additional advantage of the procedure is that the parameters of the preference distribution can be estimated simultaneously with the brand coordinates. Hence, it is not necessary to assume a fixed (uniform) distribution of preferences. An empirical application is presented in which the outcomes obtained from Shugan's procedure are compared with those from the proposed procedure.","Eric Waarts, Martin Carree, Berend Wierenga",,0

Though the literature on ways of coping with collinearity is extensive, relatively little effort has been made to clarify the conditions under which collinearity affects estimates developed with multiple regression analysis—or how pronounced those effects are. The authors report research designed to address these issues. The results show, in many situations typical of published cross-sectional marketing research, that fears about the harmful effects of collinear predictors often are exaggerated. The authors demonstrate that collinearity cannot be viewed in isolation. Rather, the potential deleterious effect of a given level of collinearity should be viewed in conjunction with other factors known to affect estimation accuracy.","Charlotte H. Mason, William D.

The author proposes that when performance against quota is a significant factor in a salesperson's compensation, that salesperson's call selection decision is influenced by his or her position in relation to quota. That is, quota acts as a reference point that influences the salesperson's behavior. Using recent advances in behavioral decision theory, the author proposes that (1) salespersons who perceive themselves to have no chance to attain quota are more likely to make risk averse decisions, (2) salespersons who have made quota are more likely to make risk seeking decisions, and (3) salespersons who have a chance to make quota select the alternative that affords the best opportunity of making quota. These propositions were tested in four studies, three involving hypothetical choice and one involving decisions made in a computerized, behavioral game theoretic experiment. The results indicate that the quota level a salesperson faces can significantly influence his or her decisions.","William T. Ross, JR.",,0

Using data from multiple samples, they provide evidence for reliability, stability, and convergent and discriminant validity for the seven facets of the MULTIRAM construct. Their analysis further reveals that Rizzo, House, and Lirtzman's global measure of role ambiguity underidentifies the role ambiguities faced by boundary spanners. Finally, the authors examine selected correlates and consequences of the MULTIRAM facets. The findings indicate that the MULTIRAM facets have nomological validity and depict differential relationships with the various correlates and consequences examined.

A Reservation-Price Model for Optimal Pricing of Multiattribute Products in Conjoint Analysis,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379102800309,01-Aug-91,01-Aug-91,28,3,347,354,"A significant application of conjoint analysis is in pricing decisions for new products. Conceptually, profit maximization is an important criterion for selecting the price of a product. However, the maximization of profit necessitates estimation of fixed and variable costs, which are difficult to estimate reliably for the large number of products available for evaluation in conjoint analysis. Consequently, users of conjoint models have begun to use a share simulation to screen a small set of attractive products. For each screened product, fixed and variable costs are estimated separately and used to simulate its profits at different price levels. The limitation of this approach is that the profit simulations are based on the assumption that the conjoint data, and hence the predicted profits, are error free. Also, though the purpose of examining alternative prices is to determine the best price at which to offer a new product, current conjoint simulators do not focus explicitly on optimal pricing decisions. The authors describe and illustrate a model for optimal pricing of screened products in conjoint analysis, incorporating the effect of measurement and estimation error on predicted profits.","Rajeev Kohli, Vijay Mahajan",,3

For large schedules the canonical expansion is more accurate than the approximate loglinear model but the reverse is true for small schedules.

Their theoretical analysis stresses the centrality of the elasticity ratio and shows how the pass-through ratio, the fraction of loyal consumers who take advantage of price discounts, and the contribution-price ratio are additional factors that influence the price-advertising tradeoff. Empirical analysis of 262 observations from published studies indicates that the price elasticity is “on average” 20 times the advertising elasticity. The elasticity ratio is higher for mature products than for products in the early stage of the life cycle, and for nondurable goods than for durable goods. These findings suggest that price discounting may be more profitable than an advertising increase for nondurable goods and mature products. The ratio is smaller for elasticities estimated from yearly data than for those based on quarterly or monthly data.

The second study showed that subjects whose brand preferences were influenced by positive affect during ad exposure were more able to feel positive when the brand name was used as a subsequent retrieval cue than either subjects without positive affect at exposure or subjects for whom a different brand name was used as the subsequent retrieval cue.

Stochastic Models of Interpurchase Time with Time-Dependent Covariates,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379102800101,01-Feb-91,01-Feb-91,28,1,1,15,"Consumers’ purchase time decisions are important elements of their buying decision process. Stochastic models of interpurchase time, which have been used extensively in the marketing literature, are parsimonious, easy to estimate, and usually fit and predict the data well. However, there has been a striking omission of marketing variables in these models. Because empirical evidence suggests that marketing variables, such as promotions, can affect consumers’ purchase time decisions, the author presents a methodology for including such variables in these stochastic models. Four commonly used models are discussed: exponential, Erlang-2 (no heterogeneity), and these two models with gamma heterogeneity. Thus one can include duration dependence, heterogeneity, and nonstationarity in the model, and also account for right-censored data. Special care is shown to be needed when covariates, such as marketing variables, vary over time. The models are analytically tractable, which makes their estimation and validation simple and fast. An illustration of the methodology is provided with scanner panel data for coffee. Inclusion of duration dependence, heterogeneity, and marketing variables is shown to improve the model's diagnostics, fit, and predictions.",Sunil Gupta,,0
A Process-Tracing Study of Brand Extension Evaluation,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379102800102,01-Feb-91,01-Feb-91,28,1,16,28,The authors explore the implications of considering a brand as representing a category consisting of its products. They report results of a laboratory experiment in which response times and verbal protocols were used to examine processes related to the evaluation of brand extensions. Evaluations of brand extensions were influenced both by the extension's similarity to the brand's current products (brand extension typicality) and by the variation among a brand's current products (brand breadth). An inverted U describes the relationship between brand extension typicality and evaluation process measures. Moderately typical extensions were evaluated in a more piecemeal and less global way than were either extremely typical or extremely atypical extensions. Subjects’ attitudes toward brand extensions were correlated highly with their ratings of brand extension typicality.,"David M. Boush, Barbara Loken",,0
Modeling Purchase-Timing and Brand-Switching Behavior Incorporating Explanatory Variables and Unobserved Heterogeneity,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379102800103,01-Feb-91,01-Feb-91,28,1,29,41,"The authors use a continuous-time semi-Markov approach to analyze in a single framework the purchase-timing and brand-switching decisions of households for a frequently purchased product. The analysis provides more insights into the dynamics of household purchase behavior than could be obtained from conventional discrete choice models such as logit or probit. The authors find that the probability distribution of interpurchase times is not the same for various switching between brands, revealing extra information about the purchase-timing decisions. Further, they find that though the marketing mix and household demographic variables explain a large part of the variation in the brand-switching rates, they account for only a small part of the variation in the repeat purchase rates. Another finding from the analysis is that the rates of switching between brands due to promotional activities such as special displays and price reductions are in reverse order to the share of purchases of the various brands.","Naufel J.

Cue Compatibility and Framing in Advertising,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379102800104,01-Feb-91,01-Feb-91,28,1,42,57,"Findings from a laboratory experiment support three research propositions on how processing goals at ad exposure and retrieval cues in the brand decision environment affect recall of communication effects and ad and brand judgments. The first proposition, the “cue compatibility principle,” is that compatibility or a match between the type of information stored in memory at encoding and the type of information present as cues at retrieval is necessary for successful recall of communication effects (e.g., cognitive responses). The second proposition is that though retrieval cues can facilitate recall of strongly associated information, they can inhibit recall of other, less strongly associated information in memory. The third proposition is that because processing goals and retrieval cues affect the accessibility and diagnosticity of communication effects, they “frame” brand judgments by influencing (1) the importance or weight placed on different types of communication effects in ad and brand judgments, and therefore (2) the actual favorableness of the judgments reached.

The choice probabilities depend on brand prices and form the basis for obtaining market-level cross-price elasticities and switching matrices by aggregation. The survey-based results are found to be predictive of the actual purchase behavior of 2000 IRI scanner panel households residing in the same area as, but not included in, the survey sample.","Randolph E.

Classical tests lack a natural metric for comparing non-nested models and often employ super models in which the entertained hypotheses are special cases (i.e., nested). Nested classical tests are almost always significant when used with scanner data, making their interpretation problematic.

Two conditions of particular importance are (1) the relative accuracy of the individual forecasting models and (2) the correlations among the models’ disturbance terms. For marketing forecasting the author demonstrates that a variety of boundary value models for the forecast combination represent reasonable model alternatives to an optimal model when it is difficult to judge the relative accuracy and disturbance term intercorrelations of the individual forecasting models.,Mark M.

They use a two-stage modeling procedure. The first stage is the determination of how expected prices are formed. In the second stage, brand choice is assumed to depend on the brand's retail price and whether or not that price compares favorably with the brand's expected price. The authors also test the hypothesis of symmetry in customer response to positive deviations (“losses”) and negative deviations (“gains”) of the retail price from the expected price. Analysis of scanner-panel data in the coffee market reveals that the brand choice model in which customers are assumed to respond to retail prices by comparing them with the corresponding expected prices provides a significantly better fit than a traditional brand choice model. Consistent with prospect theory, customers are found to react more strongly to price losses than to price gains. Results from the calibration of the expected price model indicate that expected price is not only dependent on past prices, but is also affected by the frequency with which a brand is promoted, economic conditions, customer characteristics, and the type of store shopped.","Manohar U.

If only one brand is being promoted and subjects are generally loyal to the last brand purchased, brand choice probability declines from prepromotion levels once the promotion is withdrawn. However, if subjects tend to switch among brands in the absence of promotions, or if several brands are being promoted, this decline is mitigated and/or does not occur.","Barbara E. Kahn, Therese A.

This approach (referred to as “adaptive design”) enables the researcher to pose to the respondent only those scale items (usually a subset of the entire scale) that provide useful “information” about his or her attitude. Such adaptive designs are based on a measurement theory, the Latent Trait Theory (LTT), which has been developed largely in the areas of education and psychology. However, much previous research has focused on adaptive designs that are based on binary LTT models. The authors take the first step in examining adaptive designs for Likert-type data within a marketing context. Initially they discuss and evaluate the graded-response LTT model that utilizes all of the information in Likert-type items. Then, using a simulation study, they apply the graded LTT model to implement an adaptive design for the measurement of consumer discontent. The results of the simulation suggest that an adaptive design based on the graded-response LTT performs reasonably well on several criteria. Furthermore, the findings support theoretical predictions that adaptive designs for Likert-type data can achieve measurement efficiency and precision with a substantially smaller item pool. Implications of adaptive designs for marketing researchers and practitioners, and of LTT in general, are discussed.","Jagdip Singh, Roy D. Howell, Gary K. Rhoads",,0

A system is described by individual component attributes and by its “integration” and its “modularity.” Customers have heterogeneous preferences. Competing firms offer components that can be mixed and matched with the firm's components if it unbundles. If new systems added by unbundling are more modular or have a superior component, the market may grow. Growth is the key to making the unbundling option attractive.","Lynn O. Wilson, Allen M.

Robustness and Small-Sample Properties of the Estimators of Probabilistic Multidimensional Scaling (PROSCAL),https://doi.org/10.1177/002224379002700202,01-May-90,01-May-90,27,2,139,149,"Probabilistic multidimensional scaling (MDS) models, in comparison with the deterministic ones, offer several theoretical advantages that are likely to appeal to marketing researchers. These advantages are based on asymptotic sampling theory assuming that an explicated error distribution holds true. Whether such models are perceived as practical and useful by marketing researchers, however, will depend partially on the robustness and small-sample properties of their estimators. The error underlying the judgments may very well violate the distributional assumptions, and the typical sample size in marketing applications is not likely to meet the asymptotic requirements. The authors examine the robustness and small-sample properties of PROSCAL, a probabilistic MDS algorithm based on a multivariate generalization of Thurstone's pair comparison model. The results of two extensive simulations experimentally manipulating number of subjects, number of stimuli, and type of error distribution and its variance suggest that PROSCAL estimators are robust to violations of the assumption of normality of the error term within the manipulated ranges of the parameter values. Also, goodness of recovery and dimensionality tests are fairly accurate for sample sizes as small as nine.","B. Kemal Büyükkurt, Meral Demirbag Büyükkurt",,0

In one strategy (simultaneous choices/sequential consumption), the consumer buys several items on one shopping trip and consumes the items over several consumption occasions. In the other strategy (sequential choices/sequential consumption), the consumer buys one item at a time, just before each consumption occasion. The first strategy is posited to yield more variety seeking than the second. The greater variety seeking is attributed to forces operating in the simultaneous choices/sequential consumption strategy, including uncertainty about future preferences and a desire to simplify the decision. Evidence from three studies, two involving real products and choices, is consistent with these conjectures. The implications and limitations of the results are discussed.",Itamar Simonson,,0

In a test with data collected from a group of Canadian export firms, the model receives significant support, suggesting that an important contingency when deciding on channel structure in a foreign country is the ability of the market to limit the opportunistic tendencies of outside intermediaries. When the enforcement of contractual arrangements cannot be relied upon in the market, different degrees of forward integration are feasible alternatives. Other empirical results suggest that the firm may prefer use of intermediaries in a foreign market with high environmental diversity in order to cope with its inherent complexity and maintain flexibility. Channel volume, the use of shared channels, and country destination also are shown to affect the nature of integration in channels in international markets.","Saul Klein, Gary L. Frazier, Victor J.

Moreover, the effects of experience are manifested in the evaluation and use of “soft” information, amount of information used, and the decisions themselves. The authors conclude that in studying the effects of experience on managerial decisions, one must examine the steps leading to a decision; they find that experience affects the prior step in which information is acquired.

Two well-known methods, Campbell and Fiske's multimethod-multitrait approach and the analysis of covariance structures (LISREL) approach, are used to examine the convergent and discriminant validity of the lifestyle typologies. In addition, Browne's class of direct product factor models is introduced and applied.

When participants believed they were the winners of a prize they did not expect to win, their evaluations of that prize were based more on their favorable reactions to the sweepstakes per se than on a careful appraisal of the available information on the product.

Selected management control theory suggests that the characteristics of a given marketing position should predict managers’ reliance on specific types of management controls. In turn, these controls should directly predict the extent of job-related minipathologies. In contrast, contingency theories of control suggest that task characteristics moderate the direct effects of controls on these negative outcomes. In effect, they argue that whether outcomes are positive or negative depends on the extent to which controls “fit” a given marketing position. To test these ideas, a national survey of senior marketing personnel was conducted. Three sets of findings emerged. First, the two task characteristics studied generally predict the type of controls-in-use. Second, certain controls-in-use have a modest effect on specific minipathologies. Third, the moderating effect of task characteristics is not confirmed. Implications for marketing practice and directions for future research in marketing are proposed.","Bernard J.

The Effects of Brand Positioning Strategies on Consumers’ Brand and Category Perceptions: Some Insights from Schema Research,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224378902600407,01-Nov-89,01-Nov-89,26,4,454,467,"Results of four studies demonstrate that perceptions of how different a brand is from other brands in the product category affect perceptions of the brand's position within the category. Specifically, perceptions that a brand is strongly discrepant result in a subtyped (or niche) position, whereas perceptions that a brand is moderately discrepant result in a differentiated position within the general category. Perceptions of discrepancy are affected both by the extent of discrepancy on an attribute and whether the discrepant information is concentrated in a single ad for the brand or dispersed across multiple ads for the product. The effects associated with a subtyped position, in comparison with a differentiated position, are identified (study 1) and are found to increase with time (study 2). The subtyped versus differentiated distinction for a strongly versus moderately discrepant brand is validated with a sorting task (study 3). This distinction is shown to hold in the context of multiple discrepant brands that differ in their extent of discrepancy (study 4). Implications of the findings for a theoretical understanding of subtyping versus differentiation and for the application of positioning strategies in the marketplace are discussed.","Mita Sujan, James R.

However, the model was expensive on computer time and stored array space when the number of magazines and insertions was large. An approximation to that model is developed that is of comparable accuracy yet takes less than one quarter of the computation time and eliminates the need for a large stored array. The approximate log-linear model is compared empirically with Danaher's previous log-linear model and one of Leckenby and Kishi's Dirichlet-multinomial models for equal-insertion schedules. For unequal-insertion schedules, the approximate log-linear model is compared with the log-linear model and the popular Metheringham beta-binomial model. The results show that in accuracy, the approximate log-linear model is between the log-linear and Leckenby and Kishi's model for equal insertions and is about the same as the log-linear for unequal-insertion schedules, but is significantly more accurate than Metheringham's model.",Peter J.

This robustness to misspecification of functional form may fail, however, when there are negative correlations among attributes in a choice set. A Monté Carlo simulation demonstrates that certain noncompensatory rules are poorly fit by linear models, even in orthogonal environments, and that this fit diminishes further in nonorthogonal environments. Two laboratory experiments assess the extent to which such model failure might arise in natural contexts. The first, a process-tracing analysis, examines the decision strategies consumers use in nonorthogonal choice environments. The second explores the ability of a compensatory choice model calibrated on actual choices to predict decisions made in orthogonal and nonorthogonal contexts.

In these cases, the authors argue that pioneering advantage can arise from the process by which consumers learn about brands and form their preferences. This process can produce a preference structure that favors the pioneer, making it difficult for later entrants to “compete away” the pioneer's large market share, even if brands can reposition and switching costs are minimal.","Gregory S.

The authors address opportunities and challenges involved in evaluating and improving the quality of judgment-based nominal scale data, with specific emphasis on the use of multiple judges.

The authors use information processing theory to examine consumer response to coordinated TV and radio ads. “Radio replay” is defined to occur when a consumer views a TV ad and later hears the audio track from the TV ad as a radio ad. The outcomes from radio replay are posited to depend on the relative extent of comprehension, retrieval, and elaborative processes that consumers undertake during the reinforcing radio ad exposure. The results of a laboratory experiment examining coordinated radio and TV ads show that when consumers heard a radio replay, they did very little critical, evaluative processing. Rather, they appeared to replay mentally the video from the television ad. Recall results are consistent with this processing. Judgments of the ads and the brands, however, are as positive for radio replay as they are for the television repetition condition.

One interpretation of this result is that a media-coupon or cents-off promotion undermines the consumer's repeat purchase rate. The authors describe an alternative explanation. The explanation is that the promotion temporarily attracts a disproportionate number of households with low purchase probabilities. When the repeat rates of these households are averaged with the repeat rates of those that would have bought the brand even without a promotion, the average rate after a promotion purchase is lower. This effect is demonstrated by means of a numerical example, a closed-form equation for repeat rates, a Monté Carlo purchase simulation, and a logit choice model.

The market is thereby segmented into brand loyal segments and multiple switching segments. The authors extend this approach to allow the within-switching-segment market shares to vary across periods. The changes over time in within-segment market shares are related to marketing variables such as price and promotion through a logit model. Application of the model to data from a scanner panel shows that the proposed approach produces a modest improvement in predictive validity in comparison with the traditional approach of treating the market as a single aggregate.","Rajiv Grover, V.

LADI is a model-based clustering procedure, derived from a specific conceptualization in which the discrimination problem is viewed in a latent mixture context. The basic model yields maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of mixing parameters and structural parameters that define the latent clusters in terms of the responses to a set of descriptor variables. Among other features, the model accommodates descriptor variables having different scale properties, allows for the investigation of group structure, provides a statistical test of the number of latent clusters to retain, and allows for constraints to be imposed on the solution.","William R.

Assessing the Role of Contingency Awareness in Attitudinal Conditioning with Implications for Advertising Research,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224378902600103,01-Feb-89,01-Feb-89,26,1,30,43,"The authors investigate a basic mechanism for shaping attitudes that has largely been ignored by empirical researchers in the marketing discipline. Two experiments are reported in which traditional Pavlovian procedures are merged with a view of conditioning that encourages theorizing about attendant cognitive processes. The data indicate that contingency learning or awareness may be a requirement for successful attitudinal conditioning. Contingency awareness entails conscious recognition of the relational pattern between the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli used in a conditioning procedure. In experiment 1, the conditioning procedure affected the evaluative judgments of subjects who were classified (post hoc) as contingency aware. In experiment 2, instructions that promoted contingency learning as part of the procedure again influenced participants’ attitude judgments. Implications are offered for theory development and for constructing advertisements to foster attitudinal conditioning. Specific suggestions for further research on how one might structure television commercials to foster contingency learning also are presented.","Chris T. Allen, Chris A. Janiszewski",,0
Competitive Reactions to Market Entry: Explaining Interfirm Differences,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224378902600104,01-Feb-89,01-Feb-89,26,1,44,55,"Competitive reactions are recognized as a driving force influencing marketing decisions. The authors seek to explain how established competitors in an oligopoly react to a significant new entry in their market. It has been suggested that at least some established competitors will react to a market entry positively and at least some competitors will react negatively or not at all. Both theory and evidence suggest that not all firms will react to an entry in the same way. The authors posit that interfirm differences in competitive reactions to entry can be predicted by observing, for each competitor, the elasticity of each marketing mix variable. Competitors will retaliate with their effective marketing mix “weapons” and retreat with their ineffective marketing instruments. These predictions are tested by estimating the parameters of an econometric model of demand response functions and reaction functions with data from the market for an over-the-counter gynecological product and from the airline industry. Results, replicated in the two markets, are substantially consistent with predictions.","Hubert Gatignon, Erin Anderson, Kristiaan Helsen",,0
A Monté Carlo Comparison of Estimators for the Multinomial Logit Model,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224378902600105,01-Feb-89,01-Feb-89,26,1,56,68,"Marketing researchers use the multinomial logit (MNL) model to analyze discrete choice, and estimate parameters either by maximum likelihood (ML) or minimum logit chi square (MLCS). Some controversy persists, however, over which is better. Review articles in marketing recommend ML over MLCS, but the statistics literature suggests that MLCS should be preferred. No studies have directly compared the performance of ML and MLCS in a marketing context. The authors assess the relative performance of ML, MLCS, and three other candidate estimators for MNL marketing applications involving repeated-measures datasets collected by means of multiple-subset designs. In contrast to most previous findings in the statistics literature, the results strongly support the use of ML. ML is found to outperform the other estimators on a variety of point estimation, predictive accuracy, and statistical inference criteria and ML test statistics are found to have asymptotic behavior for datasets involving relatively few replications.","David S.

Some concurrently verbalized this choice, whereas others did not. Next, they received more information on new brands and a new attribute for all brands. Both verbalizers and nonverbalizers then made a second choice using some of the first choice information incidentally acquired in memory. All subjects verbalized this second choice. The effects of the first choice verbalization manipulation were examined by analyzing the second choice protocols along with the choice outcome and task perception measures. In comparison with verbalizers, nonverbalizers did more problem framing and brand processing during earlier phases of the second choice. However, choice outcomes did not differ. The findings suggest that the verbalization manipulation may have altered the first choice, creating memory differences that affected some subsequent tasks. Retrieval measures corroborate this conclusion. The concurrent verbal protocol method is evaluated on the basis of these findings.","Gabriel Biehal, Dipankar Chakravarti",,0

Researchers generally assume that commonly used mood manipulations produce “converging effects” and do not create confounds with other explanatory variables. The authors question this assumption and show that two different versions of the same mood manipulation are capable of producing comparable mood states that have significantly different effects on subjects’ perceived self-efficacy and subsequent decision-making effort. The results suggest that future studies of mood should be designed to better differentiate mood effects from potential confounds.,"Ronald Paul Hill, James C. Ward",,0

The author proposes a method for such a decomposition whereby brand sales are considered the result of consumer decisions about when, what, and how much to buy. The impact of marketing variables on these three consumer decisions is captured by an Erlang-2 interpurchase time model, a multinomial logit model of brand choice, and a cumulative logit model of purchase quantity. The models are estimated with IRI scanner panel data for regular ground coffee. The results indicate that more than 84% of the sales increase due to promotion comes from brand switching (a very small part of which may be switching between different sizes of the same brand). Purchase acceleration in time accounts for less than 14% of the sales increase, whereas stockpiling due to promotion is a negligible phenomenon accounting for less than 2% of the sales increase.",Sunil Gupta,,0

The goals of the methodology are to bring managers a practical, usable tool that will help support their design of market tests and to obtain some insights into the market testing problem. An application of the methodology is reported to illustrate the potential of the model as a practical and easily implementable marketing decision aid.

Consistent with the model's assumptions, belief and attitudinal confidence are found to be higher for subjects exposed to product sampling alone than for those exposed only to product advertising. Attitude change is significantly greater for subjects receiving an advertising-sample exposure sequence than for those exposed to the reverse sequence, supporting the model's contention that indirect product experiences create low order beliefs that are more susceptable to change than the higher order beliefs created by direct product experience. When the subjects received a negatively disconfirming experience, those who had been exposed to highly exaggerated advertisements had greater shifts in attitude than those exposed to slight exaggeration. This effect was greater for global attitude measures when the advertisement was highly exaggerated. Finally, measures of product attitude and behavioral intentions for subjects exposed to greatly exaggerated advertising in an advertisement-sampling sequence are found generally to be lower than those for subjects exposed to sampling alone, indicating a contrast effect.","Lawrence J.

Procedures that test attribute significance at an aggregate (e.g., segment) level but maintain individual differences in preferences can be used (1) to confirm differences among benefits sought by hypothesized segments of respondents, (2) to eliminate insignificant attributes, reducing the time and cost of conjoint choice simulations, and (3) to design subsequent conjoint studies for the same product class. The author presents two tests of attribute significance in conjoint analysis. One is appropriate when consumer preferences for attribute levels can be ordered a priori and the other can be used when such ordering is not permissible. Each test permits different levels of an attribute to appear in different numbers of product profiles. The proposed tests assess attribute significance across multiple respondents with idiosyncratic preferences. Because they use rank order data, the testing procedures are not limited to a specific scaling algorithm. A Monté Carlo simulation indicates that eliminating insignificant attributes does not affect share-of-choices predictions for new product concepts if the number of insignificant attributes is not very large. Otherwise, the usual tradeoff between parsimony and predictive accuracy is necessary.",Rajeev Kohli,,0
"Advertising Exposure, Loyalty, and Brand Purchase: A Two-Stage Model of Choice",https://doi.org/10.1177/002224378802500202,01-May-88,01-May-88,25,2,134,144,"Information processing theory and findings on advertising response suggest a nonlinear response to repetitive ad exposure, mediated by brand loyalty. The response can occur in either or both of the hypothesized stages of purchase: brand choice and quantity choice. A tobit-type analysis of scanner purchases (with TV exposures) of a mature product category appears to support these hypotheses. The effect of advertising is generally nonlinear and its impact on volume purchased is mediated by brand loyalty. Advertising seems to reinforce preference for current brands rather than stimulate brand switching. However, features, displays, and especially price have a stronger impact on response than does advertising. The effect of brand loyalty dominates that of the other variables.",Gerard J. Tellis,,0
A Direct Aggregation Approach to Inferring Microparameters of the Koyck Advertising-Sales Relationship from Macro Data,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224378802500203,01-May-88,01-May-88,25,2,145,156,"The authors examine the advertising-sales relationship in the framework of the Koyck model. They note that if only macro (e.g., annual) data are available, it is necessary to approximate micro (e.g., monthly) data in order to minimize the “data interval bias” in estimating the microparameters. They examine two previously proposed models for minimizing the data interval bias and propose a direct aggregation model that avoids some of the problems common to those two models. The proposed constrained search estimation method eliminates the problem of infeasible parameter estimates present in the OLS estimation of the two previous models. A comparison of the constrained search estimation of the three models in a simulation setting indicates that the proposed model recovers the microparameters more accurately than the other two models.","V.

Models are developed for pooled store pairs to investigate the effect of promotion on store substitution. The specification of these models is based on findings from within-store brand substitution models. Within a store, price promotion produced the largest amount of brand substitution, followed by featuring and displays. Similarly, these activities produced store substitution in certain instances. However, which specific promotional variables are significant and the magnitude of the effect are a function of the geographic proximity of the stores.","V. Kumar, Robert P. Leone",,3

After unidimensional measurement has been acceptably achieved, the reliability of each scale is assessed. Additional evidence for construct validity beyond the establishment of unidimensionality then can be provided by embedding the unidimensional sets of indicators within a nomological network defined by the complete structural model.","David W.

Results of a laboratory experiment suggest that perceived performance exerts direct significant influence on satisfaction in addition to those influences from expected performance and subjective disconfirmation.

Flexible regression is a new method for performing a nonparametric multiple regression while relaxing several of the standard assumptions of regression. In particular the assumptions of linearity, normal errors, and homoskedasticity are relaxed. The approach is based on nonparametric density estimation, which results in a more synergistic and less parametrically constrained method of analysis. Asymptotic properties of estimators are explored and necessary conditions are established for the rejection of significance tests that correspond to the major tests of regression. In addition, a necessary condition for rejection of a significance test is provided to determine whether or not to use flexible regression instead of conventional multiple regression. The advantages of the method are illustrated with several examples.",Roland T. Rust,,0

They propose an approach involving four stages of analysis to examine the intervening role of multiattribute attitude models for real products in accounting for the effects of artificial design features on affective responses. The method decomposes the overall relationship of affect to artificial design features into (1) the mediating effects of a multiattribute attitude model based on real products, (2) other indirect effects, and (3) a residual direct effect. This general approach is illustrated and supported by an application to data on responses to male vocal recordings (real products) and alternative recording mixes (artificial objects). The results suggest the need to proceed with caution in using multiattribute attitude models based on real products to guide the design of artificial objects in laboratory tests oriented toward new product development.","Morris B.

Marketing channel theory has emphasized the “internal” mechanisms of achieving integrated actions. However, channels consist of exchanging organizations that are affected not only by their collective interests, but also by forces “external” to the relationship. Internal coordination mechanisms are likely to be less effective to the extent channel members are faced with uncertainties emanating from external sources. The authors examine the external or environmental factors affecting decision-making uncertainty in channels. The findings indicate that four dimensions—diversity among consumers, dynamism, concentration, and capacity—should be included in future research on the effects of environments on intrachannel variables.","Ravi S.

The findings indicate that (1) though most of the loss leader promotions had no effect on store profit, those loss leaders that did affect profit did so through their effect on store traffic rather than through their effect on sales of the promoted items, (2) double coupon promotions affected profit by increasing sales of products purchased with a coupon rather than by increasing store traffic, and (3) in-store price specials appear to have had no effect on store profit, sales, or traffic. The results of the study also emphasize the importance of building store traffic to increase retailer profit and of examining the effects of price promotions within the context of a system of relevant equations.","Rockney G.

The authors also show that defensive marketing (e.g., complaint management) can lower the total marketing expenditure by substantially reducing the cost of offensive marketing (e.g., advertising).

A model of the coupon redemption decision is developed to predict response to the coupon promotion by different consumer segments. Predictions from the model are tested by using scanner panel data from a field experiment on coupon face values. Coupon redemption rates are found to be much higher among households that have purchased the brand on a regular basis in the past. The results also suggest that most consumers revert to their precoupon choice behavior immediately after their redemption purchase.

Because the vector of choice probabilities is homogeneous within segments and heterogeneous across segments, each segment is characterized by its corresponding group of brands with “large” choice probabilities. The competitive market structure is determined as the possibly overlapping groups of brands corresponding to the different segments. The use of brand choice probabilities as the basis for segmentation leads to market structuring and market segmentation becoming reverse sides of the same analysis. Using panel data, the authors obtain the matrix of cross-classification of brands chosen on two purchase occasions and extract segments by using the maximum likelihood method for estimating latent class models. An application to the instant coffee market indicates that the proposed approach has substantial validity and suggests the presence of submarkets related to product attributes as well as to brand names.","Rajiv Grover, V.

Three of the more common tasks are repeat paired comparisons, triangle tests, and preference rankings. In this empirical study, the properties of these three tasks are compared. The repeat paired comparison test is found to be the most sensitive discrimination task, in that subjects demonstrate the greatest ability in distinguishing between formulations, and preference ranking is the least sensitive. The finding that discrimination ability measured by triangle tests is significantly correlated with that measured by paired comparisons lends support to the validity of consistent preference discrimination testing.","Bruce Buchanan, Moshe Givon, Arieh Goldman",,0

The use of multiple disaggregate choice models, each model fitting the choice process assumptions of a segment, should improve both the predictive accuracy and the quality of the diagnostic information provided.

In one experiment, subjects were exposed to either a one-sided, two-sided refutational, or two-sided nonrefutational appeal and the degree of cognitive activity incurred was measured. Results are partially supportive of both inoculation and correspondence theory, as two-sided appeals produced significantly less counterargumentation and source derogation than the one-sided appeal. In addition, the refutational appeal led to significantly more support argumentation than the one-sided appeal. However, exposure to either two-sided appeal did not differentially affect cognitions. In a second experiment, a disconfirming product trial experience was introduced as an “attack” condition to observe the effects on belief change given exposure to one of the advertising appeals used before. For all attributes, exposure to the one-sided appeal resulted in the greatest degree of belief change. Dominance for the predictions of inoculation over those of correspondence theory is not evident as belief change did not differ significantly between subjects exposed to either two-sided appeal.

Under the assumptions of a perfectly specified model for a set of non-overlapping indicators and no sampling fluctuations, an overall consistency criterion is developed showing that though measurement and structure can be evaluated independently of each other, in general, they should not be. The proposed consistency criterion clearly shows that the internal and external consistency criteria prescribed by Anderson and Gerbing are not sufficient; that is, there are correlation matrices for which the criteria of internal and external consistency both can be satisfied, yet the matrix as a whole is inconsistent. Implications of the interaction between measurement and structure are also discussed.","Ajith Kumar, William R. Dillon",,0

Indeterminacy is found to depend critically on the level of communality and to be detected more accurately via image factoring than by principal axis or principal component analysis.","Frank Acito, Ronald D.

The Role of Attitude toward the Ad as a Mediator of Advertising Effectiveness: A Test of Competing Explanations,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224378602300205,01-May-86,01-May-86,23,2,130,143,"Attitude toward the ad (Aad) has been postulated to be a causal mediating variable in the process through which advertising influences brand attitudes and purchase intentions. Previous conceptual and empirical research on this topic has suggested four alternative models of the relationships between brand-related cognitive, affective, and conative responses and ad-related cognitive and affective responses. The authors describe a structural equations analysis of these four models, utilizing two data sets generated within a commercial pretest setting. The results suggest that a dual mediation hypothesis, which postulates that Aad influences brand attitude both directly and indirectly through its effect on brand cognitions, is superior to the other three models under the particular set of conditions in the pretest setting.","Scott B.

A fundamental premise of the article is that these relationships are much more complex than a casual analysis would suggest. More specifically, though all of the research design variables and psychometric criteria are related at a conceptual level, there is no necessary relationship between many of the variables at an empirical level. Meta-analysis techniques are applied to 162 measures found in the marketing literature to examine the relationships among the research design choices of sampling characteristics, measure characteristics, and measure development processes and the various psychometric criteria of measure quality. The proposed model makes predictions for positive, negative, and no effects relationships. All of the hypotheses in the model except one are supported, with systematic variance apparently the common element producing correlations among the various indicants of measure quality. The primary conclusion is that researchers must pay much greater attention to non-empirical evidence when judging construct validity. Three recommendations are offered for measurement research in marketing.","J. Paul Peter, Gilbert A. Churchill, JR.",,0

The authors suggest that high involvement can be differentiated into two types (cognitive vs. affective). By manipulating involvement level and type (low involvement, cognitive involvement, affective involvement), they show that the three different forms of involvement have different effects on how brand attitudes are formed. They also examine how music, as a peripheral persuasion cue, affects the process of brand attitude formation. The results indicate that the effect of music on brand attitude depends on the type and level of involvement. Music had a facilitative effect on brand attitude for subjects in the low involvement condition and a distracting effect for those in the cognitive involvement condition; its effect for those in the affective involvement condition was not clear.

Specifically, the effects of reward and coercion on the expert, referent, and legitimate power sources in a marketing channel are identified. Results indicate that (1) a supplier's application of reward and punishment does affect the strength of its other three power sources and (2) these relationships exert a major influence on whatever impact reward and coercion may have on other channel phenomena such as supplier power and dealer satisfaction. The implication of this finding of a compound effect of the use of certain power sources is that channel entities should be even more circumspect about such action than would be advised on the basis of prior research in this area.",John F.

In fact, the empirical association between order of entry and market share is almost as strong as the association between market share and return on investment. The authors examine theoretical sources behind this relationship. The empirical results suggest that the higher pioneer shares are derived from firm-based superiority as well as from consumer information advantages. Nine hypotheses are developed and tested empirically. The results also indicate that order of market entry is a major determinant of market share.","William T. Robinson, Claes Fornell",,0

For product classes in which variety seeking is an important determinant of consumer behavior, this assumption is probably violated. A technique is proposed which accounts for the fact that consumers may switch between brands not because the brands are substitutes, but because the brands complement one another to meet the consumers’ desire for variety. The approach utilizes constrained nonlinear optimization to determine model coefficients that describe substitution and complementarity among brands. The proposed technique is illustrated with individual consumption histories for a frequently purchased packaged good and is shown to extend the range of insights provided by current brand-switching techniques.","James M.

A search of the published and unpublished literature uncovered 116 articles (the list of which is available upon request) that yielded 1653 reported associations between performance and determinants of that performance. The results indicate the determinants can be ordered in the following way in terms of the average size of their association with performance: (1) role variables, (2) skill, (3) motivation, (4) personal factors, (5) aptitude, and (6) organizational/environmental factors. When ordered according to the amount of the observed variation in correlations across studies that is real variation (i.e., not attributable to sampling error), the determinants rank as follows: (1) personal factors, (2) skill, (3) role variables, (4) aptitude, (5) motivation, and (6) organizational/environmental factors. To investigate whether the associations between each of the categories of predictors and performance could be partially accounted for by the presence of moderator variables, the results were broken out by customer type, product type, and type of dependent measure used. The results indicate that the strength of the relationship between the major determinants and salespeople's performance is affected by the type of products salespeople sell.

Further, this effect is strong in the high price sensitivity segment for purchase quantity and consumption. In the low price sensitivity segment the effect is marginal. Additional support for these results was obtained by choosing different cutoff points for high sensitivity segmentation.","Lakshman Krishnamurthi, S. P. Raj",,0

Case research is explored as one useful alternative research method for marketers. The nature of case research in contrast to case teaching or prescientific case culling is discussed, the appropriateness of case-based versus more conventional deductive methods is considered by researcher objective and type of problem investigated, and a four-stage case research process is described.

Methods are presented for determining the adequacy of several common model forms used to represent overall evaluations: adding, multiplying, and multilinear. Often, more than one integration model can be reconciled with the data by altering one's assumptions about the subjective values of the independent variables and about the relationship between private, unobservable overall evaluations and the overt numerical ratings that index them. Also, different integration models lead to parameter estimates (e.g., part worths) of varying levels of uniqueness and interattribute comparability. Emphasis is given to pinpointing the sorts of evidence and experimental designs that enable one to distinguish empirically among alternative model forms and psychological interpretations of the data—and, conversely, to what interpretations cannot be distinguished empirically—given only overall evaluations of a set of choice alternatives that vary along two or more attribute dimensions. Finally, the methods described are compared with model diagnosis procedures more commonly used in marketing and consumer research, including compositional correlational techniques and decompositional methods of conjoint measurement.","John G.

A composite sales forecasting model is developed which incorporates information from these different sources. In most cases forecast improvement apparently can be realized by combining multiple forecast inputs into a composite model. The concept of conditional efficiency then is introduced to evaluate the strength of an individual forecast input to the composite forecast. Upon finding the management judgment forecasts to be conditionally efficient on the basis of the composite model standard, the authors examine the management judgment forecasting task and environment in terms of the conditions which facilitate accurate management judgment predictions.","Mark M.

Most firms offer more than a single brand, and ultimately are concerned with the overall results of the entire line. The most common approach for addressing this concern has been to model the sales response function and optimize the profit function separately by brand. A model is presented which solves for the optimal product line prices simultaneously. The method requires a model which includes cross-elasticity terms and an estimation method which allows for correlated disturbances (seemingly unrelated regression). This approach is compared with results from a model not including the cross-elasticity terms, and an estimation without correlated disturbances. Inferences for optimal prices from the proposed model indicate different results and potential errors in using the more naive models. The authors provide a method for managers to use in evaluating the importance of critical parameters in their product line pricing decisions.","David J. Reibstein, Hubert Gatignon",,0

The psycholinguistically based ad language model (ALM) was applied to analysis of the propositional structure of 19 commercial scripts and 941 associated viewer recall protocols. The protocols came from either day-after telephone interviews by market research agencies or immediate free recall after forced exposure. Stepwise regressions with ALM script measures as predictors accounted for significant portions of the variance in ALM measures of how many ideas viewers would generate when recalling, how much information about execution and product characteristics they would recall, and their use of brand name and descriptive words. ALM script measures also predicted the day-after recall scores available for 16 of the commercials.

The purpose of the article is to show how a simple data transformation can purge the influence of the common general factor which typically surfaces when compositional approaches to building product spaces are employed. The method, which relies on a two-step double-centering transformation, eliminates irrelevant sources of variation. It is fundamentally different from the previously recommended practices in that it does not require the researcher either to (1) throw away the first principal component or (2) arbitrarily select attributes in order to define an affect index which then is used to replace the original simple correlations with partial correlations controlling for the influence of affect captured by the index.","William R.

The results show that linear and multiplicative models with brand-specific parameters estimated by OLS or GLS may perform as well as or better than the attraction specification. The failure of parameter restrictions and ex-post normalization to improve prediction power is explained in terms of the heterogeneity in the estimated parameters. This finding is consistent across brands and models and suggests that the hypothesis of equal response parameters across brands should be tested formally before such restrictions are imposed. The combined results suggest that the attraction model may have considerable intuitive appeal, but that its superiority for descriptive and predictive purposes is not yet established.","Roderick Brodie, Cornelis A.

Researchers seem to have overlooked this conclusion, possibly because they have approached the problem as a purely manifest phenomenon without reference to a statistical model of the data-generating process. The study of such models and their application to empirical data also reveals that position bias (1) is not necessarily disclosed by rotation, (2) is often much more important than sampling error, and (3) precludes usual estimation of the parameters of the data-generating process.

For short-term advertising elasticities, systematic variability is found related to model specification, estimation, measurement, product type, and setting of study. For advertising carryover and model goodness of fit, the “quasi-experimental design” is so imperfect that a high degree of sharing of explained variance among explanatory factors makes it difficult to identify the impact of a particular factor.

Moreover, because of differences in the definition of measurement and theory, their results have limited relevance to what was suggested in our original article. In this reply we discuss these issues, question the usefulness of Acito and Anderson's approach, and further clarify the basic proposition of our original article—that reliance on covariance fit as the sole criterion for theory testing may give the analyst an incomplete basis for evaluation.","Claes Fornell, David F.

Satisfaction is found to have a significant role in mediating intentions and actual behavior for five product classes that were analyzed in the context of a three-stage longitudinal field study.

An attempt to predict repurchase behavior on the basis of the investigated cognitive variables yielded weak results. However, repurchase predictions were improved when the model was extended to a multipurchase setting in which prior experience with the brand was taken into account.","Priscilla A.

The Effects of Serial Correlation and Data Aggregation on Advertising Measurement,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224378302000305,01-Aug-83,01-Aug-83,20,3,268,279,"Many annual data series for the sales of branded consumer goods exhibit marked autocorrelation which provides significant fits with lagged-variable advertising sales response models. Concern continues to be expressed that the source of such autocorrelation is not advertising efforts but spurious effects from temporal data aggregation, and some researchers have criticized advertising studies using annual data as being misleading. The authors investigate the source of autocorrelation in annual series and show that temporal data aggregation is unlikely to be the primary cause of upwardly biased estimates of the coefficient (λ) of the lagged dependent variable. Sampling and specification error are more likely causes. The authors develop the aggregate form of the brand loyal model for data aggregated over time and derive a formula to calculate the amount of autocorrelation that is induced by aggregation. They present a new estimation approach which takes into account the impact of aggregation on estimates of coefficients and the error terms of such models. They compare the effects of specification error on the estimate of λ for two well known approximations to the aggregate function as well as for the approximation developed here.","Doyle L.

The study findings also afford insight into the attitude polarization process brought about by group interaction. The social comparison and persuasive-arguments theories, which make different predictions about this process, are not necessarily competing as has been previously suggested. The results suggest that the relative validity of the explanation offered by each theory is determined by the environment in which interaction between groups occurs. Specifically, when group cohesiveness was enhanced, information was not transmitted effectively as predicted by the persuasive-arguments theory. However, when the value of group membership was de-emphasized, an effective transmission of information occurred during intergroup discussions.","John C. Whitney, Ruth A. Smith",,0

Further, they model the process for two types of products, a durable and a nondurable good, using experimental procedures in which three levels of expectations and three levels of performance are manipulated for each product in a factorial design. Each subject's perceived expectations, performance evaluations, disconfirmation, and satisfaction are subsequently measured by using multiple measures for each construct. The results suggest the effects are different for the two products. For the nondurable good, the relationships are as typically hypothesized. The results for the durable good are different in important respects. First, neither the disconfirmation experience nor subjects’ initial expectations affected subjects’ satisfaction with it. Rather, their satisfaction was determined solely by the performance of the durable good. Expectations did combine with performance to affect disconfirmation, though the magnitude of the disconfirmation experience did not translate into an impact on satisfaction. Finally, the direct performance-satisfaction link accounts for most of the variation in satisfaction.","Gilbert A. Churchill, Jr., Carol Surprenant",,0

The motivation for this effort is the general belief that respondent background characteristics and situation variables frequently interact with product attributes in jointly influencing preferences over a set of multiattribute alternatives. In much the same way, respondent and situation factors can interact with product attribute perceptions in perceptual mapping applications to influence the respondent's ratings of the brands. The authors describe how respondent background characteristics and situation variables can be accounted for as sources of variation which can potentially influence the reduced space configuration of brands. Essentially the approach can be viewed as chaining multivariate analysis of variance and standard perceptual mapping techniques. Two illustrative examples are provided. In one example the results show that the uncovered spatial configuration of brands was influenced not only by the perceptual differences between the brands, but also by a respondent-related factor.","William R.

Distribution-Free Methods of Approximating Nonlinear Marketing Relationships,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224378201900310,01-Aug-82,01-Aug-82,19,3,372,374,"Many, if not most, of the important functional relationships in marketing are inherently nonlinear. Fitting a nonlinear function to data involves first the specification of a model, and then the estimation of the model's parameters. Where theory gives insufficient guidance for the specification of a model, specification based on observation of the scatterplot may be required. In many instances it is difficult to specify a model accurately solely on the basis of scatterplot observation. In those instances the researcher's power of observation can be enhanced by use of a distribution-free method of approximating the underlying function. The authors discuss alternative distribution-free methods, and demonstrate how the implicit model specification process of exhaustive trial and error curve-fitting can be replaced by an explicit model specification process based on observing an approximation of the underlying function.","Roland T.

Personal cash incentives produced a significantly greater response rate than either the no-incentive control condition or the charity-incentive condition.

In those few studies which have surveyed multiple decision participants, data were collected via “snowball” personal interviews. In a single-stage snowball a known member of the DMU is asked to provide a list of other persons involved in the decision making process. That list is used for a subsequent study. Multiple-stage snowballing involves asking all of the respondents in the first stage who else was in the DMU, then those in the second stage, and so on. Exhaustive snowballing involves continuing the process until no new DMU members are generated. As snowball personal interveiws are an extremely expensive method of collecting data, large-scale DMU research has been financially impractical for most empirical studies.

However, results of prior simulation studies suggest that when categorical predictors are used in the LDF its performance can be adversely affected. The authors extend previous work on LDF performance in nonoptimal settings by considering situations in which the categorical predictors can take on more than two levels. First, they examine whether a “scoring” of the raw frequency data can improve LDF performance in situations where it is known to perform poorly. Second, as the effect of using such data in an LDF analysis is not clear, they study LDF performance as the number of levels of a categorical variable is increased to determine whether the relative gains from using discrete discriminant procedures disappear. The results of Monté Carlo sampling experiments suggest that as the number of levels a variable can take on is increased, a simple dummy variable coding of the raw frequency data followed by an LDF analysis does as well as the discrete discriminant procedure.","William R.

Results showed that informant reports often achieved convergent and discriminant validity when variance due to methods factors was explicitly modeled.

This average is integrated with the consumer's perception of the amount of variability both within and between other alternatives on that attribute—a measure of uncertainty.

In the authors’ study, the “foot” had no effect on initial responses to a mail survey, but did affect responses to a followup request. A cash incentive worked significantly better than the “foot.” No difference was found in the overall response rates whether the incentive was sent with the initial or followup mailing or with both mailings.","David H.

Specifically, the overall effect of objective product features on affect is broken down into a compositional relationship of affect to perceptions (i.e., attitude structure) and a decompositional analysis of the dependence of perceptions on product features (i.e., psychophysical relations). The approach is illustrated by a study of aesthetic preferences among piano performances differing in four factorially arrayed musical features (tempo, rhythm, dynamics, and phrasing). An integration of decompositional and compositional methods generates a summary path-analytic diagram that clearly represents the process wherein objective product features shape perceptions which, in turn, determine affect.

These principles are applied empirically to the case of a city pair of the U.S. domestic air travel market, where three major airlines compete on the basis of flight scheduling and advertising. The analysis reveals that flight scheduling has a market-expansive or a competitive effect, depending on the competitor, and that advertising does not have a significant impact on performance. In addition, several patterns of competitive reactions are found. The author offers observations on the theoretical and empirical aspects of this approach to marketing model building.",Dominique M.

ANOVA results show that the comparative mode appears to be superior only for the affective responses to the ad itself. The brand X mode of message appeal generally is superior to other modes for cognitive, affective, and conative responses toward the promoted brand. However, the differences are only partially significant at p < .05. In no case is the supportive mode superior. Some weak evidence of information overload is also uncovered. Several personality variables did not have significant effects on the relative effectiveness of the different appeals. Lack of substantial interaction effects among the three factors indicates that advertisers can determine message appeal, amount of information provided, and type of products to be promoted independently of each other.","Stephen Goodwin, Michael Etgar",,0

Consumer Reactions to Explicit Brand Comparisons in Advertisements,https://doi.org/10.1177/002224377901600408,01-Nov-79,01-Nov-79,16,4,517,532,"The relative influence of comparative and noncomparative advertising on purchase intention ratings, perceptions of believability, credibility, quantity of information, and usefulness of information is investigated. The impact of the advertiser's competitive position, claim substantiation, and theme are considered, and the degrees of brand loyalty toward the advertised and competing brands are treated as covariates. Results indicate that ratings of purchase intentions, believability, and credibility were not differentially affected by comparative and noncomparative advertisements; however, the relative effectiveness of comparative advertising is influenced by the theme and advertiser's competitive position. The terms in the model did not explain a significant amount of the variation in ratings of quantity and usefulness of information.",Linda L. Golden,,0

An important practical application of such utility assessments is the prediction of the overall value of alternative new product concepts. If these product concepts are defined as combinations of attribute levels other than the original discrete levels presented to the respondents, linear interpolation commonly is used to predict utilities for the new attribute levels. However, linear interpolation may lead to poor predictions and the consequent choice of the wrong new product to introduce in the market. Therefore, the authors present an alternative to linear interpolation: the estimation of a utility function. An analytical procedure and some numerical results are provided to indicate the superiority of the utility function approach for the prediction of attribute utilities.

For a significant number of goods and services, price is established by the technique of competitive bidding. In many instances such competitive bidding occurs after the items have been priced under monopolistic conditions.

The model treats household purchasing and inventory decisions like those of a firm. In other words, the household's purchasing decisions are assumed to be based on such factors as transaction costs, holding costs, and stockout costs in addition to product price. Household characteristics then are related to these cost parameters to identify households that are likely to be deal prone. The predictions are tested empirically by use of panel data for five frequently purchased products. The empirical results indicate that deal prone households can be identified and that the key variables affecting deal proneness are household resource variables such as home ownership and automobile ownership.","Robert Blattberg, Thomas Buesing, Ph.D., Peter Peacock,...",,3

A survey is used to obtain measures of consumer willingness to switch from a regular brand, if there is one. Each loyalty group is associated with a unique purchase probability vector. The probabilities are derived empirically from purchase behavior. By use of the purchase probability vectors, brand shares and repeat rates can be simulated by the loyalty group segmentation (LGS) model, which yields good fits. Empirical data were available which reflected the effect of price changes on brand switching behavior by loyalty groups. At first price elasticities based on deviations from average price were used with poor results. By a revised version of the model, average price was recomputed as the sum of the prices of competitive brands weighted by the percentage of the brand's total switching with each other brand. By use of such loyalty group cross-price elasticity measures, high correlations were obtained with the empirical observations of share, repeat rate, and switching behavior.","Martin K. Starr, Joel R.

Perceptions per brand attribute are hypothesized to be a function of direct measurement and brand “image.” The influences of direct measurement and image are separated. The first step in penetrating a product market is to look for segments of rival brand customers for which there is a significant gap between image and direct measurement perceptions. A second consideration is the strength of the “image” in terms of actually changing the direct measurements. The author empirically illustrates how to identify penetrable market segments in terms of image-direct measurement influences and discusses the implications of this type of information in forming a realistic product positioning strategy.,Dennis H.

Benefit segments based on the relative importance of product attributes were shown to be internally consistent between split halves for a given time period. Two years later, a comparison of the same households segmented in terms of sought benefits revealed a high degree of similarity in product attributes considered important and segment size.

In addition to offering a sales forecast, the model is designed to provide diagnostic information about a new product's strengths and weaknesses. By relating advertising expenditures, price, and perceptions of performance/acceptability of the product to sales, the model indicates how an unsuccessful product can be redesigned or the marketing mix changed to make possible a successful introduction. The model also can be used for new product planning. Given a media plan, price, sampling level, couponing, and some estimate of repeat usage, a pre-test market forecast of year-end sales can be made which allows management to evaluate different marketing plans to see which best meets profit or sales goals.","Robert Blattberg, John Golanty",,3

A new method is used for computing probabilities of success in bidding, based on the past dispersion of competitor prices. The dispersion is interpreted as reflecting different assessments of the best way to carry out the work required and not, as commonly assumed, a combination of errors in estimating one “true cost” plus differences in competitors’ markups. Applied to a sample of firms, the procedure indicates that additional estimators would increase the expected profits for each firm.","Kenneth Simmonds, Stuart Slatter",,0

Advertising is included in the profit function nonlinearly as a factor cost and as a demand stimulant. On the basis of optimal control theory, an optimal advertising-sales ratio decision rule is formulated with respect to the brand's demand parameters. Reliably collected data on sales and advertising expenditures on a bimonthly basis were used to obtain empirical estimates of the brand parameters. A simultaneous estimation of the demand parameters of all the competing brands was performed to harness efficiently the information inherent in the system of brand demand equations. Comparing the firm's behavior on brand advertising with the derived decision rule ratio suggests the potential usefulness of such analytical models for improving the productivity of advertising expenditures and for determining the change in advertising policy which would be appropriate in the event of changes in a brand's demand sensitivity.","Mario J.

The variations produced changes in the linearity and complexity of the evaluation strategies used, and in the emphasis given to specific factors. Loss-averse and fairly complex evaluation strategies were used by women who made leisurely purchase intent judgments when consumption seemed imminent. Those who made hasty judgments were somewhat more loss-averse and used simpler evaluation strategies. Those who thought consumption was a distant event used simple evaluation strategies that were not loss-averse.

Efforts to develop quantitative models for these decision areas have been hindered by the complex interactions among the areas. Attempts to isolate these decision areas for model simplification have resulted in considerable suboptimization. A multistage decision model is presented which treats the salesforce decision areas as an aggregate decision process consisting of a series of interrelated stages.
Model decisions are based on a response function which relates sales in a control unit to the many determinants of performance including potential, workload, company effort, salesman quality and experience, and prior sales history. The use of an extremely fast dynamic programming algorithm for the allocation of selling time to control units is demonstrated and the interaction between model and manager is emphasized. Model output indicates the optimum salesforce size and provides a basis for designing sales territories. Use of the model in forecasting and performance evaluation also is discussed.
The model is general in that it can be applied to most companies employing a field salesforce. The results of a promising application are presented. Reaction of sales management in the test firm indicates that model output is very useful in identifying problem areas, evaluating salesmen, and modifying territorial design to achieve the optimal allocation of selling effort.","Charles A.

A major function of nonverbal indicators for marketing application is seen to be the “triangulation” or validation effect, whereby unobtrusive and difficult to “manage” nonverbal behaviors can be used as a check on the validity of more easily distorted verbal measures of consumption behavior. Three major types of nonverbal behavior study are identified; the psychological or cognitive approach is cited as being of greatest potential applicability for incorporation into marketing analyses. A summary of findings generated from this psychological approach is presented as a practical guide to marketers’ observations of nonverbal interaction components. Additionally, the most advanced of the psychological nonverbal observation schemes is integrated with a theoretically compatible verbal process analysis tool to provide a first step toward “communicational analysis” in marketing, the integrated study of verbal and nonverbal interactional components for marketing prediction.","Thomas V.

Commonly, models which involve monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly data explicitly account for seasonal variations by the use of dummy variables. This note critically examines the use of dummy variables in seasonal models. The results of the examination indicate that although the commonly used seasonal shift model (seasonal dummy variables which influence only the intercept term of the model) may be successful in explaining the variance in market response, it may not explain it in a manner indicative of market behavior, and therefore may result in misleading implications for marketing decisions. Alternate seasonal specifications are discussed and statistical methods for selecting the appropriate model specification are considered.",Albert R. Wildt,,0

However, analysis of panel data for several frequently purchased products indicates the existence of several distinct consumer segments which are difficult to represent by a single model. It is shown, instead, that in order to describe adequately the behavior of these segments, it is necessary to use several different models while allowing consumers within a segment to have different model parameters.

Using this model future purchase behavior is predicted, and statistical inferences on the switching habits are made.","George P. H. Styan, Harry Smith, Jr.",,0,
"Estimating the Proportion of Loyal Buyers",https://doi.org/10.1177/002224376400100110,"February 1, 1964","February 1, 1964",1 ,1,56,59,"Of the people who buy a brand or product in a given period of time, a certain number—the “loyal” buyers—will buy again in a later one. The proportion of buyers who are loyal in both can be predicted from a mathematical model, using observed data relating to one period only.
In verifying the predictions against the actually observed loyalty proportion for the following period, the goodness of fit has, with one exception, averaged about half a percentage point for loyalty percentages ranging from less than one percent to over 25 percent. Practical applications of developments of this kind are also discussed.","A. S. C. Ehrenberg",,0,

These concepts are then used to explain the method of calculating sample size in the multi-cell case using the non-central Chi-Square distribution. The development is by means of an advertising research problem for delineating “different” geographical trading areas and the sample size necessary to detect differences of given magnitudes.","R.

The problems arising out of varying selection rates within dwelling units are handled by the use of a screening phase in the field and subsequent stratification of dwelling units by number of eligible respondents. The results of this design point up the feasibility of using a city directory technique to sample widely scattered groups with relatively small increases in sample variances.","Bernard Lazerwitz",,0,
