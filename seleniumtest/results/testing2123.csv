"Measure Validation in Marketing",https://doi.org/10.1177/002224377200900401,"November 1, 1972","November 1, 1972",9 ,4,361,370,"If marketers want to know the meaning of their measures, they must turn to measure validation, which consists of determining the extent to which measures correlate (convergent validity) and predictably do not correlate (discriminant validity).","Roger M. Heeler, Michael L. Ray",,0,
"Preference Measurement of Item Collections",https://doi.org/10.1177/002224377200900402,"November 1, 1972","November 1, 1972",9 ,4,371,377,"In many cases of practical interest the marketing researcher may wish to analyze preferences for collections of items. This article shows how these collections can be analyzed by conjoint measurement techniques. An application of conjoint measurement to measuring menu preferences is illustrated.","Paul E.

"A Model of Intermediate Market Response",https://doi.org/10.1177/002224377200900403,"November 1, 1972","November 1, 1972",9 ,4,378,384,"Traditional market share models can be elaborated by combining nonstationary stochastic models of brand choice with econometric models. A variable Markov model is described which allows assessment of marketing decision variables’ influence on the underlying composition of market share.","Douglas L. Maclachlan",,0,
"A Segmentation Research Design Using Consumer Panel Data",https://doi.org/10.1177/002224377200900404,"November 1, 1972","November 1, 1972",9 ,4,385,390,"This segmentation research design combines consumer panel purchase data with an attitudinal questionnaire tailored to the product under study. Both serve as input to a canonical correlation analysis for evaluating the relative importance of the independent variables as predictors of purchasing behavior and delineating market segments.","Ronald E. Frank, Charles E. Strain",,0,
"Testing Equivalence of Observed and Generated Time Series Data by Spectral Methods",https://doi.org/10.1177/002224377200900405,"November 1, 1972","November 1, 1972",9 ,4,391,395,"Validation of a dynamic econometric marketing model requires that the time series data simulated be equivalent to observed data from a comparable period. Spectral analysis is presented as an equivalence-testing technique which does not have the theoretical limitations of a simple regression approach.","Leonard J. Parsons, Walter A. Henry",,0,
"Advertisement Complexity and Looking Time",https://doi.org/10.1177/002224377200900406,"November 1, 1972","November 1, 1972",9 ,4,396,400,"The visual complexity of magazine ads was found to be positively related to looking time in all set conditions. Under an “advertising study” set, ads looked at longer were better remembered, while under a “perception study” set, ads looked at longer were poorly remembered.","Bruce John Morrison, Marvin J.

"The Functions of Political Advertising for Campaign Organizations",https://doi.org/10.1177/002224377200900407,"November 1, 1972","November 1, 1972",9 ,4,401,405,"Political ads aimed at the mass electorate served to bolster the morale and confidence of volunteer party workers during the 1970 Wisconsin gubernatorial campaign. Advertising also stimulated communication within the organization and provided a valuable source of information for persuasion activity. However, few campaign workers were recruited as a result of the ads.","Kenneth G. Sheinkopf, Charles K. Atkin, Lawrence Bowen",,0,
"The Relationship between Shelf Space and Unit Sales in Supermarkets",https://doi.org/10.1177/002224377200900408,"November 1, 1972","November 1, 1972",9 ,4,406,412,"In studying the impact of shelf space changes on unit sales, space elasticity was hypothesized to be a function of several product-specific variables, including physical properties, merchandising characteristics, and use characteristics. The model was tested using stepwise multiple regression, and it was found that the impact of shelf space on unit sales was very small relative to the effects of other variables.","Ronald C.
