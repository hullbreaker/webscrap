"Extremity Bias in Online Reviews: The Role of Attrition",https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211073579,"May 16, 2022","August 1, 2022",59,4,675,695,"In a range of studies across platforms, researchers have shown that online ratings are characterized by distributions with disproportionately heavy tails. The authors of this study focus on understanding the underlying process that yields such “J-shaped” or “extreme” distributions. They propose a novel theoretical mechanism behind the emergence of J-shaped distributions: differential attrition, or the idea that potential reviewers with moderate experiences are more likely to leave the pool of active reviewers than potential reviewers with extreme experiences. The authors present an analytical model that integrates this mechanism with two extant mechanisms: differential utility and base rates. They show that although all three mechanisms can give rise to extreme distributions, only the utility-based and attrition-based mechanisms can explain the authors’ empirical observation from a large-scale field experiment that an unincentivized solicitation email from an online travel platform reduces review extremity. Subsequent analyses provide clear empirical evidence for the existence of both differential attrition and differential utility.","Leif Brandes, David Godes, Dina Mayzlin","microeconomics, field experiments, electronic commerce, online reviews, online word of mouth",9,
"Thumbs Up or Down: Consumer Reactions to Decisions by Algorithms Versus Humans",https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211070016,"March 10, 2022","August 1, 2022",59,4,696,717,"Although companies increasingly are adopting algorithms for consumer-facing tasks (e.g., application evaluations), little research has compared consumers’ reactions to favorable decisions (e.g., acceptances) versus unfavorable decisions (e.g., rejections) about themselves that are made by an algorithm versus a human. Ten studies reveal that, in contrast to managers’ predictions, consumers react less positively when a favorable decision is made by an algorithmic (vs. a human) decision maker, whereas this difference is mitigated for an unfavorable decision. The effect is driven by distinct attribution processes: it is easier for consumers to internalize a favorable decision outcome that is rendered by a human than by an algorithm, but it is easy to externalize an unfavorable decision outcome regardless of the decision maker type. The authors conclude by advising managers on how to limit the likelihood of less positive reactions toward algorithmic (vs. human) acceptances.","Gizem Yalcin, Sarah Lim, Stefano Puntoni,...","algorithms, decision making, decision outcome favorability, attribution theory",19,
"Variety Effects in Mobile Advertising",https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437211056090,"April 12, 2022","August 1, 2022",59,4,718,738,"Mobile app users are often exposed to a sequence of short-lived marketing interventions (e.g., ads) within each usage session. This study examines how an increase in the variety of ads shown in a session affects a user's response to the next ad. The authors leverage the quasi-experimental variation in ad assignment in their data and propose an empirical framework that accounts for different types of confounding to isolate the effects of a unit increase in variety. Across a series of models, the authors consistently show that an increase in ad variety in a session results in a higher response rate to the next ad: holding all else fixed, a unit increase in variety of the prior sequence of ads can increase the click-through rate on the next ad by approximately 13%. The authors then explore the underlying mechanism and document empirical evidence for an attention-based account. The article offers important managerial implications by identifying a source of interdependence across ad exposures that is often ignored in the design of advertising auctions. Furthermore, the attention-based mechanism suggests that platforms can incorporate real-time attention measures to help advertisers with targeting dynamics.","Omid Rafieian, Hema Yoganarasimhan","mobile advertising, variety, diversity, attention, digitization, sequential decision making",5,
